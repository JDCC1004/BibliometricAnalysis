abstract = {During the UnboxingCT project summer professional development, the Integrated CT Assessment was piloted with 72 elementary teachers. The assessment is based on computational thinking integration literature and asks teachers to identify different computational thinking concepts in content area scenarios. The assessment allowed us to identify which computational thinking concepts teachers were most familiar with prior to the professional development and assess changes in their understanding following the professional development. Our next step will be validation of the assessment with a larger group of teachers.},

abstract = {In this theoretical paper, we compare computational thinking and self-regulated learning. Many studies use self-regulated learning to foster the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. Self-regulated learning skills are themselves beneficial for any learning process; here, we argue that the relationship between self-regulated learning and computational thinking is closer than the simple observation that self-regulated learning strategies support the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. We sustain that self-regulated learning and computational thinking competencies share many features (and have some differences), which would support synergistic effects so that not only can self-regulated learning be used to attain computational thinking competencies, but computational thinking activities can also be used to foster features of self-regulated learning competencies.},

Computational thinking will be a reality when it is so integral to human endeavors it disappears as an explicit philosophy''. [2] We have found that CT offers a remarkable foundation of engagement, intuition, and grounding upon which to build higher-level computer science fluency.

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.},

abstract = {Computer Programming (CP) is difficult to teach and learn. Many students who enroll in CP courses have difficulty learning to program, as they have deficits in problem-solving skills and are unable to understand abstract programming concepts. Some studies also state that teaching methods are often not the most appropriate as they are not personalized to each student’s needs and do not complement their learning styles. We believe that Computational Thinking (CT) can help alleviate the difficulties in learning to program, especially if it is developed from an early age. However, it is also crucial that teachers use effective methods to help their students develop CT skills. There are several Learning Resources (LR) (digital or paper format) to develop CT skills, however, we argue that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the effectiveness of these LR in the teaching and learning process. The evidence about the brain’s learning process can be transformed into principles applicable in Education (Neuroeducation). To understand how we could train CT at various levels of education we built an ontology, OntoCnE, that describes the CT and CP domains. OntoCnE is composed of 3 layers that define: how to develop CT; which concepts should be taught at each level of education; and appropriate training materials. This paper aims to present a CT development approach based on this ontology together with Neuroeducation guidelines. The result of our research is the fourth layer for OntoCnE, which defines the Neuroeducation guidelines to characterize the materials. To illustrate our proposal, we will use LR PathIt as a case study. This approach can contribute to innovative and more efficient training of CT.},

This keynote talk presents how ML technology upends the computational thinking (CT) consensus in computing education. It begins by presenting why and how a number of classical “CT1.0” concepts need to be re-thought for the “CT2.0” (machine learning) era, from control structures and problem-solving workflow, to correctness and notional machines. Based on a series of classroom interventions on teaching machine learning to middle schoolers, conducted by DIGS RC at University of Eastern Finland, the talk also presents how classroom pedagogy shifts between CT1.0 and CT2.0.},

VRCoding can teach computational thinking in an immersive Virtual Reality environment, exploiting passive haptics to improve interaction and give tactile feedback to the users. Passive haptics is obtained using simple physics placeholders, i.e., textured parallelepipeds, that are tracked in real-time, and aligned with the coding blocks in VR.  
The system is tested on a group of secondary school users, performing simple coding exercises with a standard monitor-based block coding environment and with the proposed VRCoding block language. Results show positive feedback concerning the sense of presence and the user experience.},

abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.},

A comprehensive search of academic databases for CT assessment publications since 2006 yielded 202 unique articles. After applying exclusion criteria, 72 relevant articles were analyzed. The selected publications were categorized by tool type, and focus, examining tool reliability and validity. This paper presents initial findings from this review.},

Bebras tasks are logical puzzles created to introduce, practice and sometimes assess Computational Thinking (CT) skills. We use the think-aloud method to investigate the problem-solving process of participants with advanced CT skills. The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, the study examines how the use of CT skills manifests itself in the problem-solving process. By examining the thought process of participants, our study provides a detailed operationalization of CT skill definitions that could be used in subsequent studies to investigate the use of the skills. Secondly, the study provides a validation of the classification of a selection of Bebras tasks. Our results show that the skills assigned to these Bebras are indeed the skills most often used by the problem solvers while solving the tasks. Finally, even though the skills are used, the results also show that this does not always translate into answering these puzzles correctly. Based on the results we therefore conclude that, without looking at the problem-solving process, the tasks may not be suitable for the assessment of CT skills.},

abstract = {The adoption of Computational Thinking (CT) in the educational worldwide curricula is progressively gaining importance from various perspectives. One particular approach, known as unplugged, does not require electronic devices and offers notable benefits as it is replicable and adaptable. Moreover, it serves to dismantle the misconception that computer science is exclusively confined to the digital realm. While both plugged and unplugged methodologies are recognized, further exploration of the unplugged approach is required, especially in Upper Secondary Education, where there is less evidence of its effectiveness. This paper presents a summary of a quasi-experimental study conducted with 11th grade students (approximately 16 years old) in a Spanish public high school. 57 students participated: 28 in the control group and 29 in the experimental group. The conducted research, based on a quantitative and experimental design, aimed to investigate the effectiveness of unplugged activities to improve CT abilities in Upper Secondary Education. The results indicated improved skills in the experimental group, suggesting the potential efficacy of unplugged methods in fostering CT abilities.},

abstract = {Within a two-year urban teacher residency program at [University], which focuses on training high school teachers to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into STEM education with an emphasis on equity, this study delves into how these preservice teaching residents (TRs) understood and applied CT in high school STEM settings. Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration.},

abstract = {The Technovation Girls program (TG) is an after-school program, where teams of female school students follow a software ideation process to address one of the UN's Sustainable Development goals. Concretely, they prototype a mobile application which they later pitch to judges. The TG curriculum gives students the tools they need to carry out this challenge, with activities focusing on entrepreneurship, product ideation and pitching, as well as coding. Previous evaluations of this program have focused on student and mentor perceptions and attitudes, collected through surveys, observation, focus groups and interviews. In this paper, we evaluate the effect that the coding part of the TG curriculum has on students' computational thinking skills, specifically in Chile, where the TG curriculum was expanded to a year to account for differences in the school curriculum. Also, in this experience, the TG program was carried out during class hours, and at both single- and mixed-gender vocational high schools. We applied an existing computational thinking test to the 2020 cohort (approx. 1000 students), before and after participating in the program, analyzing the results by school, gender and age. We found a slight improvement in test scores, with a more positive effect in male students.},

abstract = {This article presents research conducted within the School of Computational Thinking and Artificial Intelligence (EPCIA in its original form in Spanish) project, an initiative developed by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Vocational Training during the 2020-21 academic year. The study investigated whether it is possible to contribute to the development of students’ computational thinking skills and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy through programming activities using the Scratch language and the Machine Learning for Kids platform. The study involved 133 teachers and more than 2,000 students, from 4th to 8th grade, with representation from 17 of the 19 Spanish regions. Students took a quantitative test on computational thinking and another on AI before and after the intervention, and teachers and students also took a questionnaire at the end of it. The results showed that: i) quantitative tests can be used to reliably measure, in terms of internal consistency, the level of development of computational thinking and AI literacy in the Spanish school population of these ages; ii) it is possible to develop students’ computational thinking skills and raise their level of AI literacy through programming activities; iii) the intervention contributed to demystifying the main prejudices regarding AI; iv) a gender gap was found in relation to previous knowledge and experiences with these topics. Overall, the study concluded that introducing the foundations of AI in primary and secondary education in Spain is appropriate, feasible, and relevant.},

However, there is a good chance that even though we can improve the spatial skills of undergraduate students to help them succeed at computing, many students will have already opted-out of computing learning pathways in school due to poor spatial skills. Using a spatialised maths curriculum, we intend to improve the spatial skills of primary school children aged 8–9 and investigate the effect on their computational thinking. With this poster, we would like to share our work so that others can consider deploying similar programmes, and to hear feedback from the CS education community on what other aspects and factors we should consider.},

In this design-based exploration, we conducted three design activities where young children, college students, and researchers were invited to create physical play projects using the BBC micro:bit and reflect on their experiences. By examining participants’ projects and creating processes, we provide empirical evidence that remixing physical play activities with coding can engage learners in various CT concepts and practices, reveal how CT concepts and practices can be represented in physical play, and highlight implications for designing physical play-mediated computational learning experiences. Ultimately, we encourage more learning experiences to incorporate physical play into computing education for children.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their pre-service coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher's CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education. Our work will also be of interest to researchers considering DBR for technology-based educational projects.},

This panel examines the experiences of practitioners - educators, administrators, and curriculum designers--who have both experienced and supported others in incorporating CT in elementary school settings as a pathway to or component of computer science education. All panelists have worked with teachers not previously trained to teach CS and have encountered the many opportunities and difficulties of bringing CS to in-service teachers. They will reflect on the multiple ways educators grapple with CT: as an entry point to computer science, as a way to enrich core disciplines, and as a way to support equitable practice - for example, several of the panelists have experiences leveraging CT and other domains of CS to support the expression and development of emergent bilingual students. The panel will explore ways in which CT and its associated language and strategies for problem solving may provide a particularly helpful onramp to CS generally, including integration with other disciplines and with language about academic skills more generally.},

abstract = {This study presents the development of a student-centric framework for utilizing virtual reality (VR) technologies in education, specifically focusing on enhancing computational thinking skills. While numerous frameworks exist in this domain, they often lack consideration of student preferences, which are integral for fostering learner autonomy. Our proposed framework, with components developed from the constructivist learning theory, emphasises creating knowledge through interaction with the environment, focusing on autonomy, mastery, and purpose as drivers of intrinsic outcomes. Through a survey administered to hundred and fifty-seven participants, we sought to identify student-preferred strategies for learning computational thinking skills via VR interventions. Results highlighted key challenges students face when working on computational tasks are related to algorithmic and abstraction thinking. To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments. Additionally, participants recognized the importance of motivational outcomes in improving autonomy and mastery within VR-based learning tasks. Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours. Overall, this investigation sets a foundation for more student-centric, constructivist, and intrinsically-based VR frameworks in education.},

abstract = {Maker-based learning and Computational Thinking (CT) have increased in popularity in formal educational settings over the past decade. Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15% and 78% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) stands as a universal problem-solving approach applicable across diverse disciplines, transcending the domain of computer science. It embodies the mental process of structuring a problem to enable a computational solution feasible for both humans and machines. This methodology involves dissecting problems into smaller parts that are easier to understand and solve. This study delineates a meticulously designed series of CT activities within an introductory computer science course and explores their profound impact on student engagement and problem-solving proficiency. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hands-on CT practice in augmenting students' ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, and abstract complexities, and employ algorithms effectively. Notably, this infusion of CT not only cultivates theoretical understanding but also bridges the gap between conceptual knowledge and real-world application through the use of computational tools like Python programming. As CT continues to emerge as a cornerstone skill in diverse domains, this research presents compelling evidence advocating for its integration into introductory courses, laying a robust foundation for students to navigate the evolving technological landscape with enhanced problem-solving capabilities.},

abstract = {This paper investigates whether aspects of structured dance and choreography may improve cognitive skills related to computational thinking. It also explores the relationship between performance on computational thinking tasks and motivation. Twenty participants,aged between 7 and 9 years old, undertook the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt) as a pre-test, took part in three dance related workshops then completed the BCTt as post-test and responded to an adapted version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). Student performance on the BCTt improved significantly from pre-test to post-test for both boys and girls and seems generalised across the computational categories measured by BCTt. The study did not show a correlation between performance and motivation in girls but suggests that there may be some correlation between improvement in score and reported enjoyment in boys.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study about the mapping of the EUDability of End-User Development (EUD) tools with the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users. This mapping provides an approach to evaluate the suitability of a EUD environment in supporting people performing their daily work while managing and exploiting EUD tools. EUDability is a construct encompassing different dimensions that need to be assessed through a careful scrutiny by human-computer interaction experts, while CT skills should mirror those dimensions from the point of view of assessing the level of ability of users in managing problems with a computational thinking attitude. Moving from the healthcare domain, we present two cases: a tool for geriatric professionals supporting them in the preparation of cognitive exercises for elderly patients; and a tool for pharmacists, which empowers them to create robot programs related to the preparation of personalized medications. These cases have been exploited to show how to unify the EUDability assessment with the CT skills assessment. In particular, the application of the EUDability evaluation method for each tool, as well as the administration of the Computational Thinking Scale to domain experts are shown. The results of the two assessments are reported and discussed, together with the limitations of the present study. The results show the goodness of fit of the proposed EUD tools in the healthcare domain.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has become one of the key literacies necessary for talents in the digital and intelligent era of the 21st century. In the current educational environment, the content of the curriculum that is detached from reality and the fragmented knowledge have brought great difficulties to the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability. Contextual teaching can connect knowledge with reality. Through the e-learning platform combined with real-life scenarios to build a specific real situation, which can drive students to carry out rich thinking activities. Therefore, this study designed a blended contextual teaching model for the development of computational thinking based on contextual learning theory and constructivist learning theory. It was applied to the teaching of high school information technology courses, and the effectiveness of the model was verified by investigating and analyzing whether there were changes in students' academic performance and computational thinking ability under the blended contextual teaching model through the questionnaire survey method and the experimental research method. The results of the study show that the application of the model can effectively improve students' academic performance and computational thinking ability, which provides an effective reference and reference for future educational teaching practice.},

abstract = {The recent emphasis on computational thinking (CT) integration across disciplines in elementary education nationwide is important to ensure that students are well-equipped to meet the demands of the data-driven workforce. However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices.This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys.Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need for computer science education opportunities and particularly for engaging students in computational thinking ideas and practices to help them understand how computing influences our world. At its core, computational thinking (CT) is seen as understanding how computational practices (such as, abstraction) and tools (such as modeling software) can be used to explore phenomena, solve problems, and influence our lives and society. The push for CT integration has called for preparing future educators to learn CT practices and tools through stand-alone courses and within the context of disciplinary pedagogy/methods courses. However, there are few instruments that measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards computational thinking and its role in formal schooling. In this study, we developed and validated an instrument to measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards CT, its role in students' lives, and their own self-efficacy to incorporate CT into their teaching. We report results from a principal components factor analysis on survey responses from 260 pre-service teachers to identify patterns and reduce the number of dimensions of comparison in the analysis. We discuss how pre-service teacher conceptions have implications for preparing future teachers to integrate computational thinking into their instruction.},

The RPP is motivated in part by the hypothesis that a larger, more diverse group of students will choose to enroll in computer science courses in high school if they gain familiarity and confidence related to computational concepts at earlier grades. Feedback from participating teachers along with student attitude and problem-solving data suggest this is a promising approach.},

abstract = {Students who receive special services in mathematics or neurodiverse learners (NDLs) deserve to learn mathematics at a rigorous and equitable level as their peers. Yet, many of these students are not reaching proficiency. Computational thinking (CT) may function as a bridge between students' mathematical learning and their everyday lives. We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation. The need for expanded, regular PD for special educators is evident, as is the potential for CT as a bridge for mathematical understanding for NDLs.},

Cartoonimator requires only paper and a smartphone to use, offering an affordable learning experience. Children can draw the scenes and characters for their animation on the paper, which is printed with computer vision markers. We developed the mobile web app to provide an interface to capture keyframes and compile them into animations.

abstract = {Background and Objective. Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?Method. This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test.Participants. Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.Findings. Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance.Implications. Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.},

abstract = {With the development of the digital age, online teaching and learning is becoming more widespread in schools around the world. In the online teaching environment, the teaching mode of the course is an important element that receives attention in education and teaching. The online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking can improve students' learning interest and cultivate their innovative thinking ability. However, the author found through educational internship that there are problems such as single teaching activities, lack of teacher-student interaction, poor cooperative learning, and short independent learning time in high school information technology classrooms, which lead to low computational thinking ability and are not conducive to the development of students' innovative ability. The development of students' computational thinking ability is a requirement put forward by the high school information technology curriculum to secondary school students, and the improvement of computational thinking can help students adapt to the future society and meet the demand of future innovative talents. Therefore, this study takes high school students as the research object, under the guidance of constructivism and cognitivism theories, adopts survey research, experimental research and other research methods to construct and verify the online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking in high school information technology courses. The results of the study show that the online teaching mode based on the development of computational thinking can effectively improve students' algorithmic, evaluation, decomposition, abstraction and generalization thinking abilities, and thus enhance the online learning effect.},

However, how can this emerging technology benefit the development of skills, such as Computational Thinking (CT) and Design Thinking (DT), through a meaningful process of imagining, designing and tinkering with objects that could be used in real-world problems? Our knowledge is still limited, due to the complexity of designing 3D printable models from scratch with the existing digital tools. This paper discusses a web-based tool that enables learners to create and dynamically manipulate the behavior and properties of 3D printable models with high-level programming. This design aims to foster computational thinking, creativity, and design thinking skills as it focuses on the design process of the model, its behavior and its usage after printing. It also presents the results of a pilot study in which secondary school students engaged in a Design Thinking project for designing and printing sustainable everyday objects using this design. The study revealed new kinds of educational potential of 3D printing including the understanding of complex mathematical and CT ideas that were too complicated before, and the connection of CT practices with real-world problems through the implementation of a Design Thinking project with digital media.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) provides opportunities for students to build the skills they need for everyday life, future academic success, and careers. Increasingly, districts are integrating CT into K-12 disciplinary subjects and a growing number of teachers need the knowledge to lead CT learning opportunities. CT is still nascent in teacher education, however, and not all teachers are receiving professional learning on the job. Teachers need effective methods of support to ensure they are providing students with high quality CT learning opportunities. We present methods of support for integrating CT into schools. The poster highlights four methods to support teacher professional learning: allowing ample time for collaboration, a school-based advocate championing CT integration, posting and promoting curated resources, and a foundational person anchoring the work as the initiative expands. In doing so, this poster provides interrelated examples of teacher support and highlights methods of continuous support for teachers integrating CT across content areas.},

abstract = {Programming integration into K-12 curricula has become increasingly important in the rapidly evolving educational landscape. Recognizing the need to develop computational thinking among young learners, this study investigated the impact of the flipped classroom approach on computational thinking in K-12 programming courses in Macao, focusing on primary school students' experiences with block-based programmable hardware. Employing a mixed methods research design, it combined quantitative and qualitative analyses to examine how flipped classroom activities—centered around student engagement with material through e-books, videos, and interactive classroom tasks—affected students' understanding and application of computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Quantitative data were collected using the Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS), and qualitative insights were gathered through semi-structured interviews. The results indicated significant improvements in students' computational concepts and practices, attributed to the advantages of self-study and a stratified approach to task complexity. However, advancements in computational perspectives were less pronounced, highlighting the need for more opportunities for students to refine their presentation skills. The study concluded that the flipped classroom approach, especially with tools like mBlock and Codey-Rocky, effectively nurtured computational thinking in primary school programming courses. It underscored the importance of innovative teaching methods in enhancing students' ability to apply programming concepts in problem-solving and suggested areas for further improvement in educational practices.},

abstract = {In an age of rapid technological development, primary schools now teach programming to young students, focusing on developing their computational thinking, problem-solving, and ability to use computers to create solutions. However, fostering computational thinking skills in younger students was a challenging task. The serious game CodeCombat has become a potential resource for instructing young students in primary schools on basic programming principles using Python.This study delved into the role of the serious game CodeCombat in advancing computational thinking competencies among primary school students undertaking Python in Macao. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest approach, we examined 49 grade-one students over a two-week Python programming course facilitated by CodeCombat. The Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), encompassing Creativity, Cooperativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving, and Critical Thinking, was employed to measure shifts in computational thinking before and after the teaching experiment.Data analysis through paired-sample t-test highlighted notable progress in computational thinking skills, with marked improvements specifically in Creativity, Critical Thinking, Algorithmic Thinking, and Problem Solving. However, Cooperativity did not exhibit the same upward trend, implying that CodeCombat's impact was more pronounced on solitary cognitive capabilities than collaborative skills. Moreover, the correlation between different dimensions indicated that these computational thinking skills were mutually reinforcing, suggesting that enhancing one might contribute to the development of others. The findings endorsed that game-based learning is effective in programming education and recommended integrating CodeCombat to improve computational thinking in learning Python programming in primary school.},

Consequently, there is a growing need to develop reliable assessments for measuring students' proficiency in these skills. Recent works have proposed tests for assessing these skills across various CT concepts and practices, in particular, based on multi-choice items enabling psychometric validation and usage in large-scale studies. Despite their practical relevance, these tests are limited in how they measure students' computational creativity, a crucial ability when applying CT and problem solving in real-world settings. In our work, we have developed ACE, a novel test focusing on the three higher cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, i.e., Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. ACE comprises a diverse set of 7x3 multi-choice items spanning these three levels, grounded in elementary block-based visual programming. We evaluate the psychometric properties of ACE through a study conducted with 371 students in grades 3-7 from 10 schools. Based on several psychometric analysis frameworks, our results confirm the reliability and validity of ACE. Our study also shows a positive correlation between students' performance on ACE and performance on Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org.},

In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff. This paper describes our CT resource in detail, and reports teacher feedback from primary schools.},

abstract = {Pair programming is a collaborative activity that enhances students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. Analyzing students’ interactions during pair programming provides valuable insights into effective learning. However, interpreting classroom dialogues is a challenging and complex task. Due to the simultaneous interaction between interlocutors and other ambient noise in collaborative learning contexts, previous work heavily relied on manual transcription and coding, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in speech and language processing offer promising opportunities to automate and scale up dialogue analysis. Besides, previous work mainly focused on task-related interactions, with little attention to social interactions. To address these gaps, we conducted a four-week CT course with 26 fifth-grade primary school students. We recorded their discussions, transcribed them with speech processing models, and developed a coding scheme and applied LLMs for annotation. Our AI-driven pipeline effectively analyzed classroom recordings with high accuracy and efficiency. After identifying the dialogue patterns, we investigated the relationships between these patterns and CT performance. Four clusters of dialogue patterns have been identified: Inquiry, Constructive Collaboration, Disengagement, and Disputation. We observed that Inquiry and Constructive Collaboration patterns were positively related to students’ CT skills, while Disengagement and Disputation patterns were associated with lower CT performance. This study contributes to the understanding of how dialogue patterns relate to CT performance and provides implications for both research and educational practice in CT learning.},

abstract = {We propose a motor control-based characterization of how computational thinking (CT) can emerge from embodied performance. The account is based on children's activity during a tangible coding task, and a mechanism proposed by cognitive and motor neuroscience studies. For the task, the child used navigational symbols (forward, backward, rotate right, rotate left) to program the movements of a tangible robot on a 2-D grid. We propose that the development of CT through this task can be understood in terms of “tool incorporation into the body schema.” To illustrate the proposed mechanism, we use video data from one of three teaching sessions, where a group of four kindergartners learned to code using Cubetto (a tactile screen-free grid-based robotic toy). We argue that learning the task (i.e. being able to control Cubetto to perform goal-oriented movements) is challenging because the CT task requires learners to bridge three distinct discontinuities (spatial, temporal, and representational), to achieve control over the robot. We hypothesize that learners and facilitators are likely to engage in moves (both epistemic and pedagogical) that help bridge these gaps, and thus support the incorporation of the robot and its controller into the body schema. We characterize two such moves and explicate how they might support the incorporation process. The study is part of a larger program of design-based research aimed at helping young children develop CT.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered an essential problem-solving skill in the 21st century, and is receiving attention on different educational levels. To promote and assess students’ CT skills, so-called ’Bebras tasks’ (i.e. small tasks for problem solving in informatics) are created by experts in the field of CT. There has not been empirical research to determine to what extent and how CT skills are used while solving these tasks, however. This qualitative study bridges this gap by using the think-aloud method to examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras. The results of this study can serve as a validation for the use of CT skills in solving Bebras tasks. This poster abstract introduces the background and setup of the study.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a foundational skill of computer science that all elementary students should have equitable access to for learning and engaging in throughout their day. For the integration of CT into science instruction to be successful, teachers need to be able to communicate clearly what CT is and how it is defined through precise language. The intention of this poster is to explore the meaning of CT at the elementary level through a critical review of literature, analysis of standards, value-mapping across multiple stakeholders, analysis of written responses from elementary teachers on a CT survey, and deep discussions of a Design-Based Implementation Research Team (DBIR). The data collected and analyzed from these sources was combined to develop a definition of CT that would support implementation of CT for elementary teachers.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in many industries. Therefore, the cultivation of virtual reality technology talents is imminent. However, there are relatively few universities that carry out virtual reality courses. At the same time, the virtual reality course is a good carrier to cultivate computational thinking. It can improve students ' problem-solving ability, creativity and teamwork ability, which are also necessary to cultivate computational thinking. Computational thinking, as a necessary basic skill for talents in the 21 st century, needs to be improved in the training approach of college teaching. However, there are relatively few teaching approachs to cultivate computational thinking through virtual reality (VR) courses. Based on this, this study constructs a design-based STEM+VR teaching approach, which combines the interdisciplinary knowledge of STEM education with VR subject knowledge, aiming to cultivate college students ' computational thinking through virtual reality courses. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to investigate the complex ability of computational thinking of a college student in Wuhan, including five sub-dimensions:creativity,algorithmic hinking, collaborative ability, critical thinking and dimensional problem solving.The research shows that after the design-based STEM + VR teaching, the abilities in the sub-dimension of computational thinking are significantly improved. The design-based STEM + VR teaching case provided in this study is expected to provide some reference for the use of virtual reality courses to cultivate computational thinking in college education.},

To this end, based on Sternberg's intelligence education theory, combined with software development and programming knowledge, a structural framework of computational thinking was constructed. Subsequently, a project-based teaching activity based on this framework to cultivate students' computational thinking skills was carried out in the college computer programming course "Software Development Technology". By measuring students' computational thinking skills before and after the activity, it was verified that the project-based teaching model based on the proposed framework had a significant effect on improving students' computational thinking skills. By constructing a structural framework of computational thinking that integrates the characteristics of disciplines, and taking programming teaching as a carrier to implement the cultivation of computational thinking skills, it can provide a new way for computer educators to cultivate students' computational thinking skills.},

abstract = {The Make-To-Learn Lab at the University of Virginia developed TuneScope, a tool to facilitate computational thinking (CT) through music, to help democratize computer science education. Built upon the existing framework of Snap! (University of California, Berkeley), TuneScope leverages sound analysis, design, and music composition to engage novices with CT fundamentals. Existing research shows the benefits of using familiar contexts to teach CT, and TuneScope builds upon this with musical contexts. We have designed a course centered around the use of TuneScope to teach fundamentals of CT through music. In this paper, we investigate how students use TuneScope to develop sequential melodies, build chords, and sample recorded sounds while simultaneously learning fundamental programming principles such as algorithm design and abstraction. Using sentiment analysis, we demonstrate that students have had a largely positive experience in learning and grasping CT fundamentals throughout a diverse curriculum. As of today, the total enrollment of the course consists of over 45% female students with a 100% retention rate. TuneScope has also been accepted as an official Snap! library to be used by thousands of Snap! users worldwide.},

abstract = {Despite widespread recognition of the importance of computer science (CS) education and an increased focus on computational thinking (CT) instruction in the U.S., there remains a significant shortage of qualified K-12 CS teachers. Preparing preservice teachers to teach CS is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for CS education. This experience report presents a CT/CS module initiative designed to prepare secondary preservice science and math teachers to teach CT/CS through an instructional methods course that integrates instructional practice within an elementary after-school program. This initiative employs the preservice teacher preparation framework that includes the observe-practice-reflect cycle. Within this framework, the preservice teachers began with incorporating unplugged lessons and then transitioned to robotics to teach CT/CS concepts. In this experience report, we detail the design and implementation of this CT/CS module initiative and share findings that revealed the preservice teachers' increased confidence, adaptations in lesson planning, and the challenges faced in teaching CT/CS. These takeaways aim to inspire and inform other teacher educators and practitioners working to prepare the next generation of CS teachers.},

abstract = {Computational thinking can be deemed as thinking in algorithmic way, with which one can transpose given problems into computer algorithms. Since computational thinking requires abstract reasoning, it should not depend on particular programming languages. Unfortunately, introductory programming courses (CS1) often give students false impression that their goals are to teach a particular programming language. This study shares the design of new pedagogy for CS1 that removes dependency on a particular language and promotes computational thinking by teaching multiple programming languages simultaneously. Specifically, chosen programming languages range from low-level to high-level to expose students to different levels of abstraction from the details of computer architecture. Initial student survey responses from both trial and control groups show that there are significant improvements for the trial groups.},

Findings indicate PPPs with feedback and without distractors limit CL, those with feedback produce highest CT motivation, and those with an isolated block palette and without distractors produce highest CT learning efficiency. We analyze study data across nine conditions to offer insight to those developing PPP systems with the aim to advance equitable CT education for all.},

We present the exploration of a craftsmanship-driven approach to engage people in CT. To explore this approach a team of knitters, a computer scientist and a computing education expert iteratively designed the KnitxCode workshop. KnitxCode utilises knitting in combination with CT concepts as the foundation for the activities. The workshop was evaluated by 12 participants with no programming experience and with knitting experience ranging from 2-25 years (M = 6). From the evaluation we found that the craftsmanship-driven approach seemed to provide the participants with confidence to learning CT, as shared concepts and practices between knitting and computing supported transitioning from knitting craftsmanship to computing and in this way served to demystify computing.},

Nonetheless, scientific literature on both topics has rarely focused on developing frames of reference that offer incorporation of the interweaving of these skills. The objective of this document is to analyze and discuss the relationship between CT and DL in a framework where technology is used for education, with the end goal of designing a conceptual proposal that shows its common elements. The result is an initial proposal of interweaving that addresses skills such as abstraction (critical/cognitive-informational-communication), algorithm design (critical/cognitive-informational), and communication as common components, among others. We concluded that this proposal must be discussed, broadened, and considered as an initial reference framework for further analyses and delving into the topic.},

The learning system enables a dual interaction mechanism by learning through Human-Machine Competition virtually or physically. By participating in the game, students faced challenges such as board game step reasoning, model abstract, decision-making, and strategic planning, thereby enhancing their computational thinking and problem-solving skills. Results indicated that the blended board game improve students’ overall computational thinking skills, especially reasoning, decision-making and strategic planning.

abstract = {Computational Thinking is seen as a crucial skill in an increasingly digital society. Researchers and educators in higher education therefore aim to improve the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of students using appropriate interventions. However, there is currently no overview of interventions used to teach CT and how effective they are. With this scoping literature review, we provide such an overview by identifying articles that discuss interventions used to teach CT in higher education. We identify the teaching approaches used in these interventions, and discuss their effectiveness and how this is assessed. Furthermore, we look at the use of adaptive interventions. Our search of three academic databases (Scopus, ACM and ERIC) resulted in 1839 articles. After screening, 49 articles remained. A detailed examination of the interventions discussed in these articles showed that CT is still often taught through programming assignments. The interventions are evaluated in a myriad of ways, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of interventions. We therefore suggest making use of more standardized instruments to evaluate the effectiveness. Finally, although scaffolding is applied, interventions are not often adapted to the actual proficiency level of a student.},

In this paper, we design and evaluate an Intelligent Pedagogical Agent (IPA) for an OELE designed to foster Computational Thinking (CT). Specifically, we design help interventions for an in-the-wild scenario where students interact with the OELE in an unmonitored, self-directed manner. We build a student model by extracting meaningful student behaviors on real-world interaction data obtained during interaction in online classrooms and including expert insights. We show that these student models perform better than a baseline and have the potential for adaptive support in self-directed interaction with the OELE. We design an IPA with the help of teachers, leveraging the student behaviors extracted from data. Lastly, we get insights into the value of these help interventions by empirically evaluating the IPA in a formal user study.},

abstract = {There is growing attention for integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into various subjects across the K-12 curriculum with a concomitant increase of interest in investigating teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) regarding CT. This study is part of a bigger project focusing on defining the learning trajectories for CT integration into the K-12 curriculum. In particular, the present study focused on eliciting the pedagogical content knowledge and attitude of teachers with respect to the integration of CT in various disciplines. To this end, we implemented six different case studies by integrating CT into six different subjects: science, traffic, language, biology, geography, and physics. Two primary and four secondary school teachers were involved in the study. After the lesson series was completed in schools, we conducted interviews with teachers to understand their PCK on CT integration, attitudes toward CT integrated lessons, and the barriers teachers faced during CT integrated lessons. Our results indicate that compared to standard instructional activities, students can go deeper and understand the subject content better in CT integrated lessons, also students can use the power of digital technologies to solve subject-related problems. On the other hand, teachers pointed out that students and teachers need to be more capable of technical knowledge and skills to accomplish tasks.},

The integration of computational thinking into K-12 literacy instruction has only been examined in a handful of studies, and little is known about how such integration supports the development of CT for multilingual students. We conducted a qualitative case study on curricular implementation in a general education classroom with large numbers of students designated as English learners. Results from detailed field notes revealed that the strategic application of instructional practices was implemented in the service of building on students' existing literacy skills to teach CT concepts and dispositions. The CT and literacy framework put forth in this study can be used as an analytic framework to highlight how instructional strategies mobilize the existing literacy and CT resources of linguistically diverse students. Based on our findings, we discuss recommendations for future integrated ELA-CT curricula.},

This study takes a look at how students from interdisciplinary backgrounds interact using gestures and use CT to understand matrix math concepts in a group setting. A mixed-methods analysis is used to gain insight into how students’ practice CT. Data collected from pre- and post- assessments measures students’ mastery level in matrix math concepts. Video data collected during the group activity shows students’ learning process.

A total of 35 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis with a total of 49 independent effect sizes. The meta-analysis results showed that the current K-12 teaching has a moderate positive impact on the development of students' computational thinking (g=0.548). Pair programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning have the most significant effects, which are more helpful in cultivating students’ computational thinking. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of moderator variables on the relationship between K-12 teaching and computational thinking. Findings revealed that the effects of CT education were more substantial (a) for middle school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with collaborative learning activities than with individual learning activities. Based on this, we suggest that paired programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning, which are based on collaborative learning, should be used more for CT education. In addition, schools should develop interdisciplinary courses to promote computational thinking migration in different disciplines.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT), entailing both domain-general and domain-specific skills, is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.},

abstract = {In the information age, online teaching will gradually become an inevitable trend in the era of modern education informatization. Online teaching has the advantages of easy operation and abundant resources, but it has higher requirements for the design of teaching mode and teaching content. Computational thinking, as the core idea of IT teaching, emphasizes the long-term development and deep development of IT learning, which has great practical significance for students to improve themselves and cultivate their ability development. So in the online teaching of high school IT courses, how to build an online teaching mode suitable for students' development and achieve the purpose of effectively cultivating students' computational thinking? This study combines specific teaching, guided by constructivist theory, nearest developmental zone theory, situational cognition and other theories, and uses literature research method, questionnaire survey method, quasi-experimental research method and other research methods to conduct a study on the construction and validation of online teaching model of high school information technology geared to the cultivation of computational thinking. The results of the study showed that the proposed teaching model was found to have a significant promotion effect on students' academic performance and computational thinking through the examination of students' academic performance and computational thinking.},

abstract = {In our modern society, technology has profoundly reshaped various aspects of our lives, influencing the way we work, communicate, and interact. This raises a fundamental question: Is the current K-12 education system adequately preparing students for success in this technology-driven era, where innovation and problem-solving skills are essential? A recent study investigated this inquiry. The goal was to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) into the domains of Creative Writing and Creative Media and measure its impacts. This poster describes the design and refinement of summer camp experiences in which predominantly Hispanic female students participated in hands-on CT-based learning to create their own creative stories and films. Educational outcomes were evident through increased student engagement, enhanced collaboration, and improved problem-solving skills, underscoring the intervention's advantages. Furthermore, the researchers gained transforming insights, recognizing the versatility of CT across domains. Camp participants experienced a shift in perspective, with a greater interest in vocations and domains connected to computing. We share lessons learned from these summer camps in the hopes that they will inform other researchers and practitioners who are interested in designing and deploying similar experiences. In summary, the study outlines a trajectory where students and educators skillfully navigate the complexities of contemporary paradigms},

This is partly due to the fact that on the one hand, many first year students possess only moderate abstract thinking skills, while on the other hand, Computer Science lecturers often take the existence of abstract thinking skills for granted, as they themselves are well versed in this area. To bridge this gap and foster the students’ abstract thinking skills, we employ haptic material to make abstract tasks and the corresponding solution processes more tangible. This supports the development of abstract thinking skills, and at the same time helps to actively engage students in our classes on software development. In this paper we describe our experiences with active classroom learning units based on haptic materials, as part of our inverted classroom teaching.},

abstract = {Teaching computational thinking for children has reached ample dimensions along the last decade, and has culminated in the creation of various products, programs and projects that aim to democratize the access to this body of knowledge. However, cognitive, motor and affective factors have appeared as particular challenges when we are teaching computational thinking to children in the literacy phase, where the stories are a particularly relevant part of the learning process and children's development. Thus this study has aimed to articulate the inclusion of storytelling in experiences of teaching computational thinking to young children, analyzing this possibility considering the proposition of an artifact based on transmedia storytelling for teaching computational thinking and seeks to understand what are the implications of child-computer interaction in this artifact.},

abstract = {Current advances emphasize that young learners benefit from developing and applying computational thinking (CT) skills to solve problems in a variety of subjects, not limited to mathematics and science. Under this scenario, the inclusion of CT in primary and secondary education will not scale up if pre-service teachers do not actively acquire these skills during their formation. However, how this should be done is not clear. We propose an integration model to infuse CT skills at teacher colleges in Chile, which takes into account our previous work on the topic, as well as current standards, interests, and educational policies in Chile.},

abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on education has opened new doors and accelerated change, and a learning opportunity has emerged towards the digital transformation of teaching models. Computing acquires a new relevance and fits into the plan to strengthen digital skills as a driver of digital knowledge, particularly relevant for children and young people. In parallel, both the close contact with computers allows the development of skills such as logical reasoning, critical thinking, creativity, communication and teamwork, and the very coexistence of citizens with digital technologies requires the prior acquisition of this knowledge, in order to be prepared to meet the new demands of modern society. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an ongoing research project that aims at developing young children's expression through embodied computing in order to enhance their digital knowledge, by adapting the digital manipulative (DM) Mobeybou for storytelling and narrative creation as a tool for promoting computational thinking (CT) and inherent competences through a bodily expression experience. The educational toolkit and base literature review are discussed, and the early prototypes of the programming language proposed are presented, as well as the ongoing and future work. With this initial work it was possible to conclude that computer programming has many benefits in fostering CT in children, alongside other cognitive skills, as well as the importance of stimulating children's expression and communication that are transversal to all areas of life. Therefore, computer programming will be used and incorporated in Mobeybou in order to achieve the research aims proposed in this paper and promote children's expression through CT development.},

The main objective of the research plan is to propose a curricular approach of Computational Thinking (CT) competences through active methodologies in Primary Education classrooms. It is a study with a mixed methodology to obtain more detailed results; the quantitative phase consists of the development of a MOOC for teacher training in CT, evaluated through questionnaires, and the qualitative phase, a didactic proposal in which these competencies are developed, evaluated through interviews, or focus groups. Thus, we start from a state of the art where it is reflected, on the one hand, that teacher training in CT competences causes positive feedback in Primary Education classrooms and, on the other hand, the need to carry out this training and include CT, programming, and robotics in educational curricula.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the role of Minecraft-based coding activities on computational thinking (CT) of middle school students. In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students’ knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students’ final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing.},

abstract = {There is little empirical research related to how elementary students develop computational thinking (CT) and how they apply CT in problem-solving. To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students’ CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students’ CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants’ (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students’ CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.},

To address this issue, an interdisciplinary team derived a set of design rationales (integration of learning activities, scaffolding progression, cross-device interaction and supporting collaboration in all activities) and developed CoTinker: a collaborative, cross-device tool designed to foster equity in the form of equal participation amongst students. Through a pilot study, we investigated high-school students (n=15), working with CT activities supported by CoTinker, in the form of a computer model of a biological phenomenon. We found that CoTinker was able to support students’ remote collaborative work and participation equity. Furthermore, students were able to take advantage of cross-device interaction using their laptop and mobile phones in concert. We conclude that the design rationales and CoTinker design can serve as useful starting points for enabling equitable collaboration amongst students working with CT.},

abstract = {Variable is a common computer science (CS) concept and is being introduced to upper elementary students in computational thinking (CT)-integrated instruction. However, there is scant empirical evidence of when and how elementary students should learn variables. For example, national computer science (CS) standards advise introducing variables in grades 3-5 and a K-8 variable learning trajectory (LT) synthesized learning goals from the literature and hypothesized four levels of thinking in working with variables. Yet, little empirical research lies behind these. This mixed methods study examined elementary students' understanding of variables. Participants were sampled from two fourth-grade classes from a Midwestern elementary school that implemented a series of CT-integrated math lessons. Students' written responses to variables assessment items were analyzed. Additionally, cognitive think-aloud interviews were conducted with nine students to elicit students' understanding while solving the variables assessment items. Our findings suggested that most students lacked a conceptual understanding of using variables to create generalized problem solutions that could work with any set of inputs. Additionally, students had difficulty with specific mechanics of using variables such as storing user input in a variable, updating variable values, and using the values stored in variables. This study underscores the need for careful design, use, and analysis of elementary CT-integrated lessons and assessments to introduce and reinforce the conceptual understanding and specific mechanics of variables for elementary students.},

abstract = {Programming and computational thinking (CT) have become important topics in elementary education and are being implemented by national curricula, extracurricular programs, and informal learning environments. Most related research and implementation is mainly focused on block-based programming (BBP). However, BBP can lead to bad programming habits and a later transition to text-based programming (TBP) has been shown to be difficult for students, as they can lose confidence and motivation. Thus, we developed a course to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP and foster CT while also promoting motivation and students’ programming-related self-concept. We considered data from 27 fourth-grade students aged 9 to 10, who participated in the course as part of an extracurricular enrichment program. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed CT and its cognitive correlates such as non-verbal visuospatial reasoning, verbal reasoning, arithmetic competencies as well as the student’s motivation and attitude towards programming. Results indicated improved students’ CT, arithmetic, and non-verbal visuospatial reasoning. Furthermore, the transition to TBP did not significantly reduce students’ motivation for programming. Taken together, these findings indicate that the developed intervention may be helpful to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP while keeping the students motivated and fostering CT.},

abstract = {Teacher education programs are beginning to acknowledge the important role they play in preparing teachers to support students in the area of STEM, coding, Computational Thinking and robotics. As a result, new courses are being developed that connect research, pedagogy and technology within this nascent field. An example of this is Western University's Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Education course, which has been offered in year one of the Bachelor of Education program since 2015 and is part of the STEM cohort. Research has been conducted during each iteration of the course and subsequent adjustments were made in order to better serve the preservice teachers as well as respond to new insights in the field. The preservice teachers have completed at least one university degree, mostly in the areas of science or mathematics, prior to beginning their Bachelor of Education degree. This lightning talk presents highlights from the most recent version of the course following this iterative process of course design. The 36-hour course provides pre-service teachers with opportunities to explore hands-on-activities and theoretical-based approaches to Computational Thinking and pedagogy in grades 7-12, all within a blended learning context. The researchers will be further studying the pre-service teacher experience and are looking to provide recommendations for other preservice teacher education programs as well as in-service professional development programs.},

abstract = {Due to the increasingly computational nature of professions, computational thinking (CT) is of growing importance to authentic science learning and the education of future scientists. To meet this need, CT integration is expanding within classrooms. We provided professional development (PD) for pre-service and in-service teachers focused on integrating CT into elementary science. At the PD culmination, 36 teachers wrote and enacted 22 unique CT-integrated science lessons, individually or with teaching partners. Waterman et al. (2020) suggested three levels of integrating CT within lesson plans: exist, labeling already present CT; enhance, adding CT components; and extend, adding activities supporting science learning with CT. Using this framework, we examined these lesson plans, their alignment to CT practices, and the level of CT integration. Our results indicated 83.3% of teachers successfully integrated CT within their lessons, focusing on Using Data, Computational Simulations, and Programming practices. Further, we found the level of integration differed by CT practice. Data practices generally led to exist level integration, Computational Simulation practices to enhance level integration, and Programming practices tended to extend science lessons or exhibit the science topic with Programming. Our data demonstrated teachers can write CT-integrated lesson plans, but all levels of integration are not equal opportunities for authentic scientific learning. As the field seeks to offer equitable and quality CT experiences for all students integrated within disciplinary subjects, we must understand the level of CT integration and consider how different levels of integration could affect opportunities for students.},

As CT can also be seen as a problem-solving process, not only the skills and strategies are an important part of CT, but also the attitudes of the problem solvers. These have already been described as persistence, dealing with complexity, ambiguity, and confidence. An important competence for future computer science teachers is to confidently guide students’ problem-solving process. This work presents preliminary results on the relationship between pre-service computer science teachers’ CT attitudes and their performance on Python tasks. Therefore, N=19 pre-service computer science teachers solved three tasks in Python and rated their attitudes towards solving the tasks. However, the preliminary results only allow to draw tentative and interpretative conclusions.},

This study focuses on language arts, in particular English as a second language. It investigates digital storytelling as a way to integrate CT, analyzing its impact on students’ learning both of English and of CT, and on students’ attitudes toward the CT integrated English lesson. A class of 8th grade students (average age 13 years) participated in the study. The impact of the CT integrated lessons was investigated using students’ final products, surveys, rubrics, exit tickets and focus group interviews. The results suggest that the digital storytelling approach may improve students’ learning of English and of CT, and that it helped enhancing students’ creativity and collaboration, thus promoting their digital participation.},

abstract = {With the continuous development of information technology, computational thinking has become a necessary quality for students to adapt to the era of artificial intelligence in the 21st century. After the release of the Information Technology Curriculum Standards for Compulsory Education (2022 edition), computational thinking has rapidly attracted wide attention. This paper adopts the bibliometrics method to study the core journals and dissertations on the training of primary school students' computational thinking collected by CNKI (China National Knowledge Network) from 2012 to 2023, and analyzes the current situation and trend of the training of primary school students' computational thinking from the aspects of the number of literatures, sources, research hotspots and frontiers, combined with Citespace software. It provides useful reference for related researchers.},

abstract = {Nature connection fosters children's healthy development, and long-term sustainable behaviours. Most research into children-nature connection has focused on positive experiences. However, theories of constructive hope suggest that as well as imbuing a love of nature we should also help children understand environmental challenges. Computational thinking is a skillset that might help young children frame and address complex problems. This skillset is currently exclusively developed indoors using technological devices and indoor activities. Our research explored an opportunity to develop young children's computational thinking skills through nature play. An observation and contextual inquiry study was conducted with young children in an Early Childhood Education Centre. We found that computational thinking is evident in children's outdoor nature play and that HCI research could undertake design to further enhance their computational thinking skills outdoors. This can add value to their learning by harnessing their interest, understanding and connection, and by introducing children to environmental problem-solving.},

abstract = {With a focus on problem resolution, Computational Thinking (CT) can assist in developing cognitive abilities. A way to work with CT is using educational digital games (EDG), a ludic tool that stimulates the students’ learning. Still, adjustments are needed so that students with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) can use these games. Based on this scenario, we presented a Bachelor’s final paper that envisioned the creation of an EDG, aiming to contribute to the learning of the target audience, based on the promotion of the development of CT. Called “Pensar e Vestir”, the game uses the four pillars of CT by addressing choosing and wearing clothes. For that, the development counted with a multidisciplinary group – stakeholders and specialists from the areas of Computer Science, Education, Specialized Educational Assistance, and ID – and followed the Simple Interaction Design lifecycle model, with the definition of requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation. As a result, this EDG has two phases and eight situations each: time to sleep, the school in the heat, school in the cold, costume, park, tour, teacher, and market. The game was evaluated by specialists, Computing students, and one neurotypical child, we also intend to make a large evaluation with the target audience. As an outcome, the interaction design process with different stakeholders and specialists provides different insights and improvements to the game. Also, the game is accessible to neurotypical and with ID students.},

An explicit focus of this PD was to engage teachers in analyzing CT- and CRT-integrated science classroom scenarios (i.e., vignettes). Our analyses of video and written data of teachers' vignette responses indicate that while their understanding of CT increased as a result of the PD, the teachers need additional support around CRT. We suggest that future studies explore how teachers define and enact CRT, especially within their unique contexts.},

This study analyzed the relationship between computational thinking and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using text mining and data visualization techniques. A text mining method was employed to analyze computational thinking and its sub-competencies (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm) appearances in the OSDG Community dataset, consisting of 32,120 text fragments labeled with the associated SDG. Results revealed that computational thinking and its subcompetencies: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm, were frequently linked to SDGs 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The findings demonstrate the potential of computational thinking to provide innovative solutions to global problems and support the achievement of the SDGs. The study can be of value to stakeholders in the social, governmental, academic and business sectors interested in sustainable development and educational innovation in the application of computational thinking.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a highly contentious subject with many diverging meanings and definitions. This study presents a preliminary literature review of 71 peer-reviewed articles on CT. The papers indicate the existence of five main aspects that have historically been used in association with its definition: Algorithm, Abstraction, Modelling, Simulation, and Implementation. Based on this preliminary literature study, semi-structured interviews with eight CT scholars are conducted, in order to evaluate these aspects and to identify qualitatively different perspectives on CT, which integrate the mentioned aspects in different ways. From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives. This paper proposes to put these three (+1) perspectives in dialogue, in an effort to support researchers and practitioners working with CT across different fields.},

In this study, we address two pertinent questions: (1) What types of artifacts do students develop across different disciplines in response to CT-driven problem prompts' and (2) What types of CT skills do these artifacts demonstrate? To answer the questions, we examined 273 artifacts developed by undergraduate students across seven course assignments from four disciplines: mathematics, sociology, music, and English using a rubric developed to evaluate the following CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking. We found that a range of skills were reflected across student artifacts.},

abstract = {As computational thinking (CT) becomes increasingly acknowledged as an important skill in education, self-directed learning (SDL) emerges as a key strategy for developing this capability. The advent of generative AI (GenAI) conversational agents has disrupted the landscape of SDL. However, many questions still arise about several user experience aspects of these agents. This paper focuses on two of these questions: personalization and long-term support. As such, the first part of this study explores the effectiveness of personalizing GenAI through prompt-tuning using a CT-based prompt for solving programming challenges. The second part focuses on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a GenAI model in a semester-long programming project. Our findings indicate that while prompt-tuning could hinder ease of use and perceived learning assistance, it might lead to higher learning outcomes. Results from a thematic analysis also indicate that GenAI is useful for programming and debugging, but it presents challenges such as over-reliance and diminishing utility over time.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking has become an important cognitive skill to develop in all areas of education. Despite its increasing popularity, the construct itself is only partially understood. There are few measures currently in place that advance our understanding of computational thinking and its subconstructs. In this article, we analyze existing measures of computational thinking (CT), looking specifically at their measures of decomposition. Decomposition is defined as the process of breaking down a problem into its sub-components. Even though most definitions of computational thinking include decomposition, fewbreak down the decompositional process beyond a basic definition. As one of the first steps in the computational thinking process, it is important to better understand the various manners in which decomposition occurs, which methods are most effective, and under what conditions. To better understand the decompositional process, we analyze evidence of decompositional process in a variety of disciplines. We then present a framework for decomposition in computational thinking. We demonstrate how this framework may help educators to better prepare students to break down complex problems, as well as provide guidance for how decompositional ability might be measured.},

Students learn principles of abstraction, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking; no coding experience is required. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that students are learning and applying computational thinking principles. Since the course is designed and taught by a musician and is run in the music department, students also learn a significant amount of music theory and composition, including harmonic structures and harmonization principles, melodic organization, consonance and dissonance, aural analysis of formal structures and meter, and influence of rhythm and timbre to create desired sounds.},

abstract = {Teachers new to computing who are not familiar with technical “jargon” can feel like they have landed in a foreign world, making them reluctant to take on the subject, and potentially leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings in the classroom. The diversity of technical words, metaphors, and phrases in different contexts can make their meanings confusing, ambiguous or misunderstood for the diverse user groups in computing education. Therefore, understanding the nature of the commonly claimed difficulties and confusion caused by computer jargon among teachers becomes important for finding ways to address this issue. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study conducted to understand the nature of teachers’ understanding of computational terms (jargon) related to Computational Thinking concepts, and how a relevant professional development intervention can help to resolve issues related to them. The results indicate that the nature of the teachers’ understanding of computational terms can be either that the computational meaning is not known, that the computational context is unclear, or their applicability is unclear. Concerns about teachers finding computer jargon difficult to understand can be because the computational context in which they are applied makes them difficult for teachers to understand, rather than not knowing their meanings in the first place. Moreover, appropriate support can enable teachers to learn the techniques and skills that the terminology refers to.},

abstract = {The Louisiana Department of Education partnered with the Gordon A. Cain Center at LSU to pilot a Computing High School Graduation Pathway. The first course in the pathway, Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT), is designed to teach programming and reinforce mathematical practice skills of nine-grade students, with an emphasis on promoting higher order thinking. In 2017-18, about 200 students and five teachers participated in the pilot, in 2018-2019 the participation increased to 400 students, and in the current 2019-2020 year about 800 students in 11 schools are involved. After describing the course content and the teacher training, we briefly discuss the data we have collected in the last two years. The overall student reception of the course has been positive, but the course was categorized by most students as hard. The pre-post test content assessments show that students have learned not only the language, but also general principles of programming. Lessons learned during the pilot phase have motivated changes, such as emphasizing during Professional Development the need to provide timely feedback to students, provide detailed rubrics for the projects and reorganize the lessons to increase the initial engagement with the material. After two years of running pilots, the course is becoming student-centered, where most of the code and image samples provided in the lessons are based on code created by previous students.},

abstract = {Boardgames exist that explicitly address Computational Thinking (CT for short) concepts and practices. Some are actual games, while others are more akin to gamified learning activities. And since CT has been formalized only recently, many existing boardgames unknowingly might support aspects of CT. To help educators and game practitioners navigate this complex landscape, we analyze a selected sample of analog games, and propose to categorize their features with respect to CT concepts and practices. The main contribution of this paper is a novel way to identify potential CT-relevant games, that leverages on the authors’ experience with digital and analog games, playful and game-based learning. Although limited, this approach appears promising and practical for CT teachers and game designers interested in adapting existing games to the classroom or developing better CT-supporting boardgames.},

Structural equation modeling with partial least squares technique was followed to establish the factor structure of the scale. The internal consistency reliability was assessed using composite reliability. The convergent validity was evaluated based on two criteria, the outer loadings and the average variance extracted. Accordingly, 44 items that did not load properly on a particular construct were excluded, and the refined scale has confirmed its reliability and validity to the acceptable requirements.},

However, existing approaches are often either too general, not taking into account the diversity of genres and mechanisms between video games, or too narrow, selecting tools that were specifically designed for educational purposes. In this paper we propose a more fundamental approach, defining beneficial connections between individual design patterns present in video games and computational thinking skills. We argue that video games have the capacity to elicit these skills and even to potentially train them. This could be an effective method to solidify a conceptual base which would make programming education more effective.},

Four categories of students -- students in poverty, multi-lingual students, students with disabilities, and students who have below-grade-level proficiency in reading and math, may face academic challenges that can hinder their learning in CS/CT curricula. However, little is known about how to support these students in CS/CT instruction, especially at this young age. TIPP&amp;SEE, a meta-cognitive strategy that scaffolds learning by proceduralizing engagement through example code, may offer some support. A quasi-experimental study revealed that the gaps between students with and without academic challenges narrowed when using the TIPP&amp;SEE strategy, indicating its promise in providing equitable learning opportunities in CS/CT.},

abstract = {Today’s teaching and didactical methods are trying more and more to integrate digital technologies and computational thinking (CT) into other subjects. One way of combining and integrating these important skills and CT into all subjects, school levels, and school types is to include the game Poly-Universe (PolyUni). According to the results of the Poly-Universe in School Education (PUSE) study 2018, the game can be expected to have a positive effect on visual perceptual progress, including isolation and the development of shape-background skills. So far, however, comparatively few attempts have been made to explore the educational possibilities of PolyUni for different school levels and subjects, besides mathematics. This research explores how PolyUni can be used to promote CT and to evaluate whether the learning objectives in the subjects of physical education and biology have been achieved. Furthermore, it examines how PolyUni combines the requirements of the different curricula in secondary school, based on self-designed tasks. Additionally, further aspects PolyUni can promote besides the curriculum in secondary school are discussed. To explore the above-mentioned aspects, a mixed-methods study methodology was used. The participant observation method was employed for qualitative data collection, and a self-designed assessment grid and additional picture analysis were used for the quantitative data. The game was utilized in two workshops for biology and physical education at an Austrian secondary school, and fifty-six students were observed and analyzed. Based on the present data, it can be assumed that PolyUni helps to achieve the requirements of the curricula and pre-defined teaching and learning objectives in a playful way. Furthermore, the game not only promotes CT in secondary school but also encourages enjoyment and collaboration between peers in biology and physical education lessons.},

In this paper, we draw on the notion of mental models to relate the concepts of Computational Thinking and Digital Culture. We claim that practicing basic skills when exploring simple prototypes favors people to build mental models that are useful to understand and use technologies. In a case study, we engaged adults in their initial stages of literacy in activities that evolved from basic ones with a low fidelity ATM prototype to complex ones with a functional prototype. We identified that participants used the experience and knowledge they obtained from previous activities to carry out the next ones, showing confidence and autonomy when exploring a functional prototype.},

Nevertheless, design students are seldom able to design and implement interactive elements because of their limited programming skills. Although there have been some approaches to teach computational thinking using physical computing and focusing on solving real-world problems (e.g., electronic devices such as Arduino, using sensors and actuators), they often entail monetary expenses and require knowledgeable instructors, and are not catered to students without prior programming or electronics knowledge. Hence, we propose the use of Protobject, a low-cost tool that focuses on real-world applications that could be used to teach programming to design students. This study aims to evaluate students’ perceptions regarding the usability of Protobject as a tool for learning computational thinking, as well as the clarity of the learning activities designed to teach computational thinking concepts by using Protobject.},

abstract = {The worldwide push for computing education at younger ages requires that teachers are prepared to deliver instruction that supports all learners. Other discipline-based education research fields offer a wealth of instructional scaffolds worthy of exploration in computing. One such scaffold drawn from math education is diagramming. While diagrams are frequently employed in university computing, little is known about its applications in K-8 (ages 6-14) computing.To inform diagram design for K-8 computing, we investigated how the spatial orientation of a diagram (horizontal or vertical) influenced the extent to which K-8 teachers developed different technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) of computational thinking (CT) concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and decomposition. We found that more teachers were able to decompose a sequence of events when using a vertical diagram. While teachers in both conditions were similarly able to describe various CT concepts and aspects of TPACK, more teachers using a vertical diagram made connections between concepts, whereas more teachers using a horizontal diagram described concepts in isolation. We hope this exploration will spur future work into diagramming and more broadly, spatial reasoning in K-8 computing.},

The collaboration was designed to facilitate participants' learning about and application of foundational principles of computer science and computational thinking into K-8 STEM curriculum and teaching. Participants explored hard/software platforms and used open-source sites such as Scratch, Code.org and Code Academy. Participants envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms and worked in pairs or groups to design a problem-based project for students. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a means to help learners engage in authentic disciplinary and problem-solving practices of computer science (CS). For CS classrooms, CT is considered "thinking like a computer scientist". CT is believed to be an important learning goal of introductory CS in addition to CS concepts and programming. Despite the growing attention on CT in K-12 CS education, there is lingering confusion on the what and how of CT, and CT's relationship to coding and CS. Education research on disciplinary thinking skills in science and mathematics education can provide guidance for teaching and learning of CT. For example, (a) The shift in emphasis on disciplinary thinking helps focus on deeper conceptual understanding rather than rote learning of knowledge and facts. Hence thinking like a scientist, or mathematician, historian or computer scientist, draws attention to authentic practices of those disciplines. (b) Thinking skills are best taught in context. Therefore, CT should be taught in CS classrooms or integrated into learning of other subjects rather than taught as a separate skill or subject. (c) Even if there is no transfer beyond the context in which they are taught, a focus on thinking skills helps in deeper conceptual learning; (d) Like critical or creative thinking, CT should be integrated into other subjects to enrich learning. Research on meaningful technology integration across subjects provides useful frameworks to inform CT integration efforts. This talk aims to productively move the discourse on CT toward concrete ideas for K-12 educators, researchers, and curricular designers.},

abstract = {The Swedish government has recently introduced digital competence including programming in the Swedish K-9 curriculum starting no later than fall 2018. This means that 100 000 teachers need to learn programming and digital competence in less than a year. In this paper we report on our experience working with professional teacher training in Sweden's fifth largest city. The city has about 150 000 inhabitants and about 50 schools with about 14 000 students in primary education. The project has been carried out in close cooperation with the municipality.The work started in the fall of 2014 with a pilot study with 10 teachers in different subjects that was carried out during spring 2015. The pilot study was successful as the teachers were able to introduce activities related to programming and computational thinking in their subjects after only two half day workshops. The next step was to scale this up to include all the schools in the city. As expected, this turned out to be a larger challenge. More than 70 teachers were involved in the second part of the project. Some of the lessons learned are that it is quite easy to provide teacher training, but harder to get teachers to actually change their teaching and even more challenging to get teachers to help their colleagues introduce programming or computational thinking in their teaching.Based on our experience we draw some general conclusions and make suggestions for how to scale up the teaching of programming and computational thinking to all.},

abstract = {The recent widespread popularity of computational thinking (CT) has raised the need for a reliable method for assessing it. Recent CT tests focus on programming skills rather than the analytical ability and problem-solving processes in science, philosophy and other areas of knowledge.  This poster presents the results (Test design) of an ongoing project that has developed a Psychometric Computational Thinking Test (PCTT) which has three phases: test design, test implementation and applying the test. In regards to the PCTT design, the reliability and validity of the test were based on content and construct validity which also includes its rating scales for its application.  This work makes two contributions: (1) a standardized CT Test design incorporating psychometric techniques as well as computational techniques and (2) the inclusion of open-ended questions and their assessment with V of Aiken in order to validate responses.},

abstract = {The demand for computational thinking (CT) problem solving abilities surge as every aspect of life becomes more dependent on complex digital technologies. Just as in math and language, a strong CT foundation needs to be established in early education in order for students to develop an instinctive CT perspective of the world. The urgent demand for CT instruction in elementary school quickly draws attention to the shortage of elementary school-level teachers qualified and interested in CT. Additionally, with a commitment to equity in the United States education system and knowledge of the high percentage of English language learning (ELL) students in schools, the obligation to create curricula that will provide access to CT knowledge, skills, and practices for elementary-level ELL students is loudly apparent. In response to these two needs, our team has adapted existing Scratch-based CT curriculum to support classroom teachers with minimal CT experience and to be more accessible to English language learners. The purpose of this paper is to share the framework that guided the curriculum adaptations, to describe the specific changes that were made, and to discuss discoveries made during the process. This journey may be helpful to anyone who is tasked with modifying a curriculum to meet the needs of novice content teachers and ELL students.},

abstract = {The momentum around computational thinking (CT) has kindled a rising wave of research initiatives and scholarly contributions seeking to capitalize on the opportunities that CT could bring. A number of literature reviews have showed a vibrant community of practitioners and a growing number of publications. However, the history and evolution of the emerging research topic, the milestone publications that have shaped its directions, and the timeline of the important developments may be better told through a quantitative, scientometric narrative. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the drivers of the CT topic, as well as its main themes of research, international collaborations, influential authors, and seminal publications, and how authors and publications have influenced one another. The metadata of 1,874 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the keyword “computational thinking.” The results show that CT research has been US-centric from the start, and continues to be dominated by US researchers both in volume and impact. International collaboration is relatively low, but clusters of joint research are found between, for example, a number of Nordic countries, lusophone- and hispanophone countries, and central European countries. The results show that CT features the computing’s traditional tripartite disciplinary structure (design, modeling, and theory), a distinct emphasis on programming, and a strong pedagogical and educational backdrop including constructionism, self-efficacy, motivation, and teacher training.},

Short-term interventions, including programming skill outreach activities, have been reported to increase self-efficacy and willingness to pursue computing careers in young women. We explored the impact of a programming outreach activity on three types of measures for 30 female pupils: computing self-efficacy, social participation, and understanding of basic computing concepts. Preliminary results revealed a significant increase in participants' self-efficacy and sense of belonging in computing after the informal learning activity. Students were more focused on tasks when engaging socially with their peers and teachers. A decrease in misconception was observed in uni-structural knowledge but no significant difference was found in multi-structural computing knowledge acquisition. These data provide a baseline for study of the long term impact of outreach activities.},

By focusing on a food-based activity in an after-school maker space, we reflect on the pedagogical and methodological innovations, and the ethical and aesthetic qualities of food-based activities for participatory design. The session brought together students and teachers to form a generative dialogue around computation and automation while preparing and sharing food. The results suggest opportunities to rethink current curricular, pedagogical, and education policy strategies. Recommendations for organizers to prepare generative activities where food is used as a design material close the paper.},

In this poster, we discuss the design and implementation of a simulation that models the growth and spread of a hypothetical disease. The goal is to help middle school students develop computational thinking skills while learning how a virus spreads through the human population.},

abstract = {Tools like MIT App Inventor and Scratch are designed to help students develop programming and computational thinking skills by allowing them to use their interest and personal experiences to create meaningful artifacts. However, students often need additional help in translating their ideas into functional programs because they lack understanding of how to map the visual aspects of their projects to programming constructs and understanding of how to develop appropriate algorithms that bring their ideas to life. To address this issue, we created a Computational Thinking App Design Mat (App Design Mat) to scaffolds students' CT skill development in the context of creating a mobile application with MIT APP Inventor 2. The App Design Mat fosters student engagement in computational thinking through four areas of the mat: Problem Decomposition, Pattern Abstraction, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithm Design. In this poster will describe the design and results from the use of the App Design Mat with 80 eighth grade students. Our results suggest that most students understood the purpose of using the App Design Mat, used the App Design Mat effectively, and used some aspects of the App Design Mat in developing their final mobile app project.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly becoming a part of the K-12 educational landscape. While high schools with computer science teachers or technology coaches on staff are well positioned to help teachers integrate computational thinking into instruction, early childhood through middle schools (grades p-8) are often less well equipped. Further, the concept of CT is often poorly defined, especially as it relates to younger learners. Despite these challenges, teachers are being asked to integrate CT into other content lessons. To understand if and how this is happening, we conducted a statewide survey of primary (early childhood through middle school) Maryland teachers. The survey asked the teachers about their conceptualization of CT, CT resources they rely on, and their comfort levels to provide effective CT instruction for their students. The results of our survey demonstrate that teachers hold diverse views of the concept of CT and use a varied set of instructional resources in their classrooms. The contribution of this work is in helping advance our understanding of the current state of CT in primary classrooms.},

abstract = {For K-8 computer science (CS) education to continue to expand, it is essential that we understand how students develop and demonstrate computational thinking (CT). One approach to gaining this insight is by having students articulate their understanding of CT through cognitive interviews. This study presents findings of a cognitive interview study with 13 fourth-grade students (who had previously engaged in integrated CT and mathematics instruction) working on CT assessment items. The items assessed four CT concepts: sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition. This study analyzed studentstextquotesingle articulated understanding of the four CT concepts and the correspondence between that understanding and hypothesized learning trajectories (LTs). We found that 1) all students articulated an understanding of sequence that matched the intermediate level of the Sequence LT; 2) a majority of studentstextquotesingle responses demonstrated the level of understanding that the repetition and decomposition items were designed to solicit (8 of 9 responses were correct for repetition and 4 of 6 were correct for decomposition); and 3) less than half of studentstextquotesingle responses articulated an understanding of conditionals that was intended by the items (4 of 9 responses were correct). The results also suggested questioning the directional relationships of two statements in the existing Conditionals LT. For example, unlike the LT, this study revealed that students could understand "A conditional connects a condition to an outcome'' before "A condition is something that can be true or false.''},

abstract = {With the development of the era of artificial intelligence (AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking (CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of CT perspective can promote the growth of students ' connection ability, questioning ability and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ' CT perspective. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective of students in third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students, but the improvement of connection ability is not significant. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students ' computational identity.},

Even though these are crucial areas in today’s world, they are only rarely taught in school and interventions that target these areas simultaneously are still very rare. We therefore developed a four-day workshop with the aim of fostering computational thinking and social-emotional skills in Grade 4 students. To do so, we used the child-friendly programming language Scratch. In the present paper, we investigate the feasibility of such a workshop. In total, 18 students participated. Data was collected via observation and interviews and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results showed that students liked working with Scratch and liked working on social-emotional challenges. The workshop was found to work well and students worked independently. Pair work activity was found to be particularly beneficial. Although some issues initially proved challenging (mostly relating to “how to” issues in Scratch), these may easily be addressed by making suitable adaptations to the introduction of the program provided on Day 1 of the workshop.},

The results have led a personalized education for students, recognizing previous skills as well as trying to correct those missing, so that it acquires the competences respective, credit the course and improve the retention percentage of the first quarter. In this sense, when detecting possible skill gaps, is it possible to predict what will be the impact to maintain or decrease enrollment during and the end of quarter? The present work aims to answer the question by the results interpretation obtained from the computational thinking evaluation to 242 new students, generation 2018. Initially, it was stablished which would be the student's situation during and the end of four months from September to December based on the correct assessment reagents; three categories were determined: 1. Sure desertion, 2. Safe permanence, 3. Variable permanence. Later, 50 students who enrolled the next quarter (January-April 2019) were revised if they had been predicted properly; using a survey, the familiarity of key concepts of the subject Programming methodology was obtained with the aim of determining a correspondence with the evaluation of computational thinking skills, as well as the established situation, consequently, establishing the validity of predicting the enrollment.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as an important part of K-12 education in many countries and is often described in term relating to computer science both in concepts and context. However, the unique practice of computer scientists collaborating on problem solving is often overlooked in CT education in high school. We believe that collaboration is a key aspect of modern computing, and propose to integrate collaborative CT activities into existing high school education. The aim is to prepare students better for exploring computational approaches to high school disciplines as they are practiced in the professional world. Our research question is: how can we design tools for supporting students' collaboration while teaching CT in high school? A new computational environment, CoTinker, has been developed. The tool uses a cross-device approach and foster students' verbal communication and collaboration in groups. The tool was tested in a Biology class. Students' computational thinking (CT) was assessed through learning activities and students' communication was analyzed by audio recordings, of students, imbedded in CoTinker and by focus group interviews with students. Preliminary findings showed students being able to collaborate and solve CT tasks in groups independent of teacher or researchers. Results also indicated that students were able to use, navigate, and critically reflect upon the CoTinker environment.},

This article is based on STEM86 platform, ISTE published by the author "Educator standards: Under the guidance of computational Thinking ability, a standard system for evaluating teachers' computational thinking teaching ability was constructed, and a test scale for evaluating teachers' computational thinking teaching ability was designed. The reliability and validity test and difficulty differentiation test proved that the designed test scale had good scientificity and reliability. On this basis, using this scale, through the empirical way, from three dimensions of computer discipline knowledge and skills, teaching design ability, evaluation and reflection ability to evaluate teachers before and after using STEM86 platform computational thinking teaching ability changes. The results show that STEM86 platform not only solves teachers' programming teaching resource needs, but also effectively improves teachers' computational thinking teaching ability, and provides more references and ideas for teachers' computational thinking teaching ability improvement research.},

The programming and computational thinking contents had been adapted to their particular needs and integrated into their current curricular activities. We studied the engaging of students using KIBO, the grade of comprehension of the sequences and programming and the emotional behavior of students with DS during the sessions. The results of this study shows that people with DS are capable to acquire satisfactorily basic programming and computational thinking skills using KIBO. Also, the motivation and the emotional state of DS students were positive promoted through the designed activities.},

This paper presents a case study of middle schoolers in an informal learning environment focused on integrating music composition with coding in TunePad. Specifically, we collected and analyzed logs of coding events, final code products, and surveys to explore both CT concept use and CT practices exhibited by the participants as they completed open-ended music coding activities to create their own melodies with specific music and CT requirements and recommendations.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is being considered as a key set of problem-solving skills to be acquired by the new generations of digital citizens and workers in order to thrive in a computer-based world. However, from a psychometric point of view, CT is still a poorly defined psychological construct: there is no full consensus on a formal definition of CT or how to measure it; and its correlations with other psychological constructs, whether cognitive or non-cognitive, have not been completely established. In response to the latter, this paper aims to study specifically the correlations between CT and the several dimensions from the 'Big Five' model of human personality: Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) are administered on a sample (n = 99) of Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade. Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience (r = 0.41), Extraversion (r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness (r = 0.27). These results are partially consistent with the literature about the links between cognitive and personality variables, and corroborate the existence of a non-cognitive side of CT. Hence, educational interventions aimed at fostering CT should take into account these non-cognitive issues in order to be comprehensive and successful.},

Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student competency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so. Additionally, survey responses from course teachers support the importance of our work.},

In this paper, we present ExposAR – a collaborative cross-device AR system enabling children to create, use, and reflect on AR technologies through the co-creation of a simple AR application. With ExposAR, we explore three core design principles: 1) reify computational concepts, 2) support collaborative cross-device authoring, and 3) incorporate the user’s own world. These principles were developed through a co-design process with teachers and evaluated with 46 primary school students. We found that the collaborative authoring process with ExposAR supported students in understanding AR concepts and challenged their perspectives on AR. With these results, we bring AR to the CT agenda and contribute novel design principles for exposing the underlying mechanisms and implications of AR.},

abstract = {Coding as a practical skill and computational thinking (CT) as a cognitive ability have become an important topic in education and research. It has been suggested that CT, as an early predictor of academic success, should be introduced and fostered early in education. However, there is no consensus on the underlying cognitive correlates of CT in young elementary school children. Therefore, the present work aimed at (i) assessing CT and investigating its associations to established cognitive abilities, and (ii) evaluating a newly developed CT course for elementary school children.As such, 31 7-10-year-old children took part in 10 lessons of a structured CT course. The course aimed at introducing and fostering CT concepts in both unplugged and plugged-in ways, incorporating life-size board games, Scratch, Scratch for Arduino, and Open Roberta programming environments. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed several cognitive abilities using standardized tests on nonverbal-visuospatial and verbal reasoning abilities, numeracy, as well as short-term memory, and measured CT using an adapted version of the only existing validated test CTt, to accommodate it to the younger sample.We identified significant associations between CT and nonverbal-visuospatial reasoning, as well as different aspects of numeracy (e.g., fact retrieval and problem completion). In line with recent theoretical accounts and empirical investigations for other age groups, these findings specify the underlying cognitive mechanism of CT in elementary school. Moreover, our results indicated that students were able to specifically improve their CT abilities through the course, as assessed by the adapted version of the CTt.},

In this experience report, we will describe the workshop design and share the perspectives of the participating K-5 teachers. One particular area of focus of the workshop was integrating 'plugged' or technology-based computing examples for the teachers. Further, we engaged the teachers with a discussion of the role of CT in promoting equity for students and demonstrated ways in which student cultural experiences could be activated through creative computing. Specific outcomes of the work included increased confidence and value in CT vocabulary usage, ideas to infuse existing curriculum with CT ideas, and teacher belief that CT could be used as a "gateway" for learning CS. We make recommendations for future efforts to include CT in pre-service teacher preparation.},

These earlier phases are, however, important to let children meet open-ended problems, brainstorm solutions and ideate their own creative designs. In this paper we present a model for an online, scalable and scaffolded design workshop for covering such aspects at K-12 level. Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively. Moreover, additional resources could support teachers in continuing the discussion with the students after the workshop.},

Classroom use of these robots may involve use by groups of children due to cost, logistical, and pedagogical reasons. To understand design factors affecting the social use of these robots, we explored the use of three programmable robots with distinctive design characteristics in a kindergarten classroom. Our findings suggest that programmable robot designs that may work well for use by individual children may cause difficulties when shared by groups of children if not all children in the group are able to easily perceive the input (program), output (robot actions), or program state. Based on these design factors we provide recommendations for the design of programmable robots, their evaluation for social use, and for addressing design limitations with support by adult facilitators.},

abstract = {This mixed methods study examined barriers faced by three elementary schools in their approaches to integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom instruction. Because CT is a relatively new instructional area, limited research guides CT integration, especially in bringing CT to academically, linguistically, and culturally diverse instruction. This study, therefore, examined challenges faced by teachers in bringing CT into their instructional practice. Data included interviews with 11 teachers and surveys of 46 teachers in a large, urban school district. The three schools in the district were part of a CS for All initiative in their school district. Data revealed common challenges: a) Limited CT teaching expertise; b) Limited time for CT integration; c) Lack of CT-specific assessment knowledge and tools; d) Limited pedagogical understanding for meeting students' diverse instructional needs; and e) Low teacher-buy-in for teaching CT. Our data also showed differences across schools in access to classroom implementation infrastructure such as technology and curricular resources, competing administrative priorities, and types of professional development opportunities. This study points to practical implications for supporting integration of CT in elementary contexts. Most notably, it is critical to proactively address these barriers in preservice and in-service teacher preparation as well as in school-wide infrastructure in order to have a sustained CT integration effort.},

abstract = {With the global movement to incorporate computer science instruction into elementary education, learners are being introduced to computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) ideas at increasingly younger ages. At these early ages, young learners are developing cognitive abilities foundational to their education. While other discipline-based education fields, such as math, science, and reading, have long studied the role of cognitive abilities, such as short-term working memory and long-term retrieval, in their respective fields, similar research in computer science education is relatively sparse. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between cognitive abilities and CS/CT performance of fourth-grade students (ages 9-10) who underwent either an introductory CT curriculum based on Use–&gt;Modify–&gt;Create or the same curriculum with additional scaffolding from the TIPP&amp;SEE metacognitive learning strategy. Our analysis revealed performance on CT assessments to be weakly correlated with working memory and long-term retrieval, with correlations increasing as the CT concepts grew more complex. This suggests that scaffolding beyond TIPP&amp;SEE may be needed with more complex CT concepts. We also found that when using TIPP&amp;SEE, students scoring below average on cognitive ability tests performed as well as students in the control condition with average cognitive ability scores. These results indicate TIPP&amp;SEE’s potential in creating more equitable computing instruction. We hope that results from this initial exploration can help encourage further study into the role of cognitive abilities in CS/CT education for young learners.},

abstract = {In this work, we describe our effort to develop, pilot, and evaluate a model for infusing computational thinking into undergraduate curricula across a variety of disciplines using multiple methods that previously have been individually tried and tested, including: (1) multiple pathways of computational thinking, (2) faculty professional development, (3) undergraduate peer mentors, and (4) formative assessment. We present pilot instantiations of computational thinking integration in three different disciplines including sociology, mathematics and music. We also present our professional development approach, which is based on faculty support rather than a co-teaching model. Further, we discuss formative assessment during the pilot implementation, including data focusing on undergraduate students' understanding and dispositions towards computational thinking. Finally, we reflect on what worked, what did not work and why, and identify lessons learned. Our work is relevant to higher education institutions across the nation interested in preparing students who can utilize computational principles to address discipline-specific problems.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we describe a pedagogical approach aimed at preparing pre-service teachers to integrate (CT) into K-8 contexts. Specifically, we present a standalone educational technology course with explicit attention on connecting CT to disciplinary content and pedagogy while introducing a range of digital tools. Data were collected from 34 pre-service teachers over the period of one semester. Specifically, a total of 68 lesson plans developed by pre-service teachers through two distinct lesson planning tasks using concept mapping and programming tools were collected and analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The analysis utilized a coding scheme that focused on identifying specific CT practices illustrated in each lesson. It also examined differences in the CT practices exhibited in each lesson planning task. Findings indicated that the CT practice of data was most prevalent in pre-service teachers' lesson plans. Outside of data, however, there was greater variation in the CT practices represented in programming lesson plans compared to the concept mapping lesson plans. Implications for teacher educators are discussed based on the findings.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has recently gained more and more relevance as problem-solving competence of the 21st century. Taking Wing's [1] grand vision into account, each student should have certain skills in computational thinking in order to be able to participate adequately in social life and in his/her future profession. Thus, the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS 2018) does in addition to other student competences also measure their achievement in computational thinking [2]. In this internationally comparative large-scale assessment with a representative sample, a sound body of information is gathered that is used, among others, to explain variation in students' achievement in computational thinking. One field that represents a national extension in Germany is problem-solving. This paper presents a PhD project that focuses on this field and provides an analysis model that examines the relationship between students' self-perceived problem-solving skills and their computational thinking skills, taking into account further variables of influence and aims to explain variation in students' achievement of computational thinking.},

abstract = {In this study, we adapted the notion of framing, a theoretical construct that refers to a person's expectations about social spaces (Goffman, 1974), to investigate whether teachers viewed computational thinking (CT) according to subject-specific frames. This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: frame shifting focused teachers' attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject's particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught both 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as separate subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Instead of accepting fragmented notions of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking is argued to be an essential skill for the workforce of the 21st century. As a skill, Computational Thinking should be taught in all schools, employing computational ideas integrated into other disciplines. Up until now, questions about how Computational Thinking can be effectively taught have been underexplored preventing efforts to cross the large gap between early adopters and the early majority, conceptualized as the Computer Science Education chasm. A promising strategy to cross the chasm is underway in Switzerland. Switzerland recently introduced a national curriculum, called Lehrplan 21, mandating Computer Science Education. This mandate requires the Computer Science education of elementary and middle school students. In 2017, the School of Education of Northwestern Switzerland (PH FHNW), introduced a mandatory pre-service teacher Computer Science Education course, to satisfy this mandate. All the PH FHNW students who study to become elementary school teachers must pass this two-semester course. The first part of this course was taught for the first time in fall of 2017. This paper presents the philosophy of this course and an initial analysis of both qualitative data capturing the students’ perceptions of Computational Thinking and quantitative data describing shifts in students’ skills and attitudes as effect sizes. The data suggest that it is possible to teach a basic understanding of programming to non-self-selected pre-service elementary school teachers.},

abstract = {Calls for standardized and validated measures of computational thinking have been made repeatedly in recent years. Still, few such tests have been created and even fewer have undergone rigorous psychometric evaluation and been made available to researchers. The purpose of this study is to report our work in developing and validating a test of computational thinking concepts and skills and to compare different scoring methods for the test. This computational thinking exam is intended to be used in computing education research as a common measure of computational thinking so that the research community will be able to make more meaningful comparisons across samples and studies. The Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test (CTCAST) was administered to students in several courses, evaluated and revised, and then administered to another group of students. Part of the revision included changing half of the items to a multiple-select format. The test scores using the three scoring methods were compared to each other and to scores on a different test of core computer science knowledge. Results indicate the CTCAST and the test of core computer science knowledge measure similar, but not identical, aspects of students' knowledge and skills, and that item-level statistics vary according to the scoring method that is used. Recommendations for using and scoring the test are presented.},

Eye-tracking has become one of the most popular methods to study what individuals view, in what order, for how long, and how often, and it is a technology that could give us a window into students' cognitive processes and could be used as an assessment tool for comprehension of CTCs [1].This study presents eye-tracking technology as an objective, non-intrusive, and easy-to-administer assessment instrument to measure students' comprehension of core CTCs including sequences, loops, events, parallelism, conditionals, operators, data, motion, looks, sound, pen, and sensing. It explores gradual changes in students' comprehension of CTCs as reflected on three eye-gaze data as a proxy; FD (Fixation Duration), SA (Saccade Amplitudes), and RF (Regression Frequency).},

abstract = {This paper describes our process of creating computational thinking (CT) resources for primary school teachers in Ireland. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has proposed a revised primary mathematics curriculum with an emphasis on CT skills and problem solving, and some teachers would like to introduce it already on an informal basis. However, CT is not yet part of teacher training. Our motivating question has been: how can teachers without a computer science background deliver CT at primary level in Ireland? Our process involves third-level computer science academics co-creating resources with in-service and pre-service teachers during workshops. The resources comprise a workbook and lesson plans. Our resources are based on tasks from the International Bebras Challenge, a well-known large-scale international CT contest with a reasonably gender-neutral profile of school-age participants. The workbook consists of ten Bebras tasks, each followed by a page of original activities on the theme of the task. A set of ten lesson plans accompanies the workbook. Each lesson plan has information about how to use the corresponding workbook activities in the classroom, where the activity might fit into the existing curriculum, categorisation of the task in terms of eight CT topics, differentiation, and extension activities. This paper explains our process of workshop planning, workbook creation, and lesson plan co-creation. Preliminary evaluation of our process uses teacher feedback.},

The curriculum utilizes multiple representations, requiring students to work with physical phenomena, chemical equations, digital simulations, and modifiable code-based representations. Much CT focus on abstraction naturally emphasizes (1) extraction of a set of features from an object or process, and (2) finding commonality between objects and processes. But Rosen encourages us to think about abstraction as also including the production of new concepts or actions. Integrating CT into science offers the possibility of enhancing this aspect of abstraction. Changing the representational affordances available to the students allows them to take their CT thinking beyond learning-to-abstract towards learning-through-abstraction. This perspective moves computation from an internally focused exercise into the expression of valued ideas in a computational medium.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is regarded as a key competency for k-12 children in the 21st century. In this project, a design-based learning (DBL) approach was proposed to improve elementary school students’ CT. This approach included programming skills learning and STEM practices with authentic real-life contexts. We assessed CT in a more accurate manner with experience-sampling methodology (ESM). A quasi-experiment study was carried out to assess how the intervention was associated with students’ self-perceived CT skills using event-based experience-sampling methodology. Forty sixth graders engaged in the curriculum units to create artifacts that solve specific real-world problems using Arduino electronic kits and Mind+ programming software. Results revealed that students’ self-perceived CT skills increased to a greater extent statistically. Using the experience sampling method, students’ self-perceived CT skills has different fluctuations in different stages of DBL, at the third phase of designing artifact, there is a significant decrease because learners are unfamiliar at the beginning of complicated cooperation in depth, which is likely to produce discourse conflicts and reduce efficiency. With the intervention of teachers, learners begin to improve greatly in the later stage. Learners have the highest CT in the iteration and improvement phases of prototype making and the final demonstration stage. In addition, collaboration plays an extremely important role in DBL, especially in the design phase. This study contributes to research in DBL teaching approach, CT instruction, its application in STEM education in particular, and how it can be used in elementary level education in general.},

Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as a tool for developing XXI century skills, but Chile has a large population of in-service teachers that do not know what CT is, limiting its application in classrooms. In response, the government has enacted a training program for in-service primary school teachers, focusing on changing their perceptions about CT, and showing them how it can be used in classroom. This training program was designed for grades 1-6 and piloted in the capital region during 2018. The program initially focused on coding activities, but was then redesigned to show how CT can be used to help meet the learning objectives of different subjects in the curriculum. The program was then scaled up nationwide. In this experience report, we discuss the outcomes of this program. The training program scaled as intended and we identified positive changes in teacher perceptions about CT, especially among female participants. We conclude with the lessons we learned from this experience.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop a set of sequence test called CTST, and to determine whether it can be used to assess Sequencing Ability in computational thinking (CT). The content of the test is adapted from Baron-Cohen's picture story. We selected 5-7-year-old students (N=1234) from seven public schools in China for the test. The difficulty and distinguishing degree of each question were tested. Combined with the result of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), it is concluded that the sequence tests questions was composed of thirteen items, including three factors (amount, event and machine). Among them, four of the items that did not meet the standard were deleted. Our study also explored the differences of gender and age between 5-7-year-old students. The results show that the Sequencing Ability of girls is stronger than that of boys, and 7-year-old children may be the key period for the development of sequential ability. Generally speaking, the sequential test has good psychometric characteristics and can distinguish children with different CT sequencing Ability. We also discussed the limitations and direction of future work.},

abstract = {One of the key factors for measuring success in distance learning is student interaction with learning materials. Remote instruction has gained substantial traction with the advent of online education, and this attention has increased in the presence of global pandemics. The asynchronous nature of remote learning has deteriorated the quality of education for learners, which calls for the design of novel interactive techniques to promote student engagement. We study the impact of traditional learning tools such as textbooks and videos in contrast with interactive learning media in computational and algorithmic thinking, and investigate students' perception of learning and actual learning comprehension in higher education.},

abstract = {Free-form Game-Design (GD) environments show promise in fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills at a young age. However, such environments can be challenging to some students due to their highly open-ended nature. Our long-term goal is to alleviate this difficulty via pedagogical agents that can monitor the student interaction with the environment, detect when the student needs help and provide personalized support accordingly. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation of one such agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT environment. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make less errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Based on these results, we provide insights on how to improve the delivery of the agent’s interventions in free-form GD environments.},

abstract = {There is a growing need to present all students with an opportunity to learn computer science and computational thinking (CT) skills during their primary and secondary education. Traditionally, these opportunities are available outside of the core curriculum as stand-alone courses often taken by those with preparatory privilege. Researchers have identified the need to integrate CT into core classes to provide equitable access to these critical skills. We have worked in a research-practice partnership with two magnet middle schools focused on digital sciences to develop and implement computational thinking into life sciences classes. In this report, we present initial lessons learned while conducting our design-based implementation research on integrating computational thinking into middle school science classes. These case studies suggest that several factors including teacher engagement, teacher attitudes, student prior experience with CS/CT, and curriculum design can all impact student engagement in integrated science-CT lessons.},

abstract = {In the information age, computational thinking has become a basic quality necessary for learners. How to effectively improve the teaching effect and cultivate students' computational thinking ability has become the focus of most scholars. With the extensive development of "Internet+", the traditional face-to-face offline teaching mode has been unable to meet the diversified and personalized learning needs of students, and blended learning has become a brand-new teaching mode, and studies have shown that blended learning can effectively improve the computational thinking ability of learners. Therefore, this study analyzes and discusses the current situation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning, which helps us to deeply understand the current situation of high school students' blended learning, think about how to promote high school students' blended learning, and improve high school students' computational thinking ability, so as to promote the quality of education and teaching. In this study, the literature research method, interview analysis method and questionnaire survey method were used to investigate the current situation of blended teaching activities on the cultivation of computational thinking with 138 freshmen, sophomores and juniors in a high school in western China. The results found that the overall situation of computational thinking level in blended learning of students in a high school in western China was moderate. This was characterized by better levels of cooperative and critical thinking skills, and poorer levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills. By describing the current situation, it can be seen that there are some problems in the level of computational thinking ability of high school students in blended learning, based on this, this study, based on the specific research data, combined with the results of the interviews, puts forward some suggestions for improving the cultivation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning in a high school in western China in three aspects.},

abstract = {As computing education begins to grow in K-12 classrooms, it is increasingly important to understand the relationships between a student's coding attitudes and computing outcomes. While work has been done at the undergraduate and high school level, less is known about elementary students, and even less about Latinx students. We sought to explore the connections between Latinx elementary students' coding attitudes and computational thinking (CT) skills after participating in a year-long, remote computing curriculum in a public school district in Southern California. We collected validated measures on coding attitudes and CT skills for 164 fourth-grade students. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the relationship between the coding attitude constructs (i.e., confidence, utility, perception of coders, social influences, and interest) and scores on a CT assessment while controlling for demographic factors (i.e., gender, English language fluency, free or reduced lunch status, reading and math standardized test scores). In a model demonstrating acceptable fit, only math scores were a significant predictor of CT scores and coding confidence. Confidence was found to be significantly associated with the other attitude constructs except for perception of coders. Our results indicate that confidence plays a prominent role in student computing learning, especially at a young age. Efforts to better support Latinx students in computer science should include strategies that address students' coding confidence, such as developing positive perceptions of a student's learning process (e.g., failures as learning opportunities) in specific coding skills and practices (e.g., tinkering, debugging).},

abstract = {Computational thinking has already been acknowledged as an important learning objective for all students in compulsory education. Our research interests focus on the assessment of fundamental computational thinking competencies, such as collection, organisation and analysis of data, algorithmic thinking and abstraction. For the needs of our research, we implemented the digital platform PhysGramming, which constitutes the backbone of a relevant assessment tool we have built. PhysGramming is developmentally appropriate for first and second grade primary school students and provides the opportunity to create their own digital games, transforming them from passive consumers to active creators of digital technology. The assessment tool has been applied to 450 students in the first and second grade of primary schools on Crete, Greece from February to June 2019. The research was conducted attuned to the ethical guidelines of educational research, within the framework of the physical and natural science courses and evolved around three axes: (a) Checking the validity and the reliability of the results that come out when applying the proposed assessment tool. (b) Designating the levels of computational thinking skills of students at first stages of schooling. (c) Checking the correlation between the levels of computational thinking skills and the comprehension of the lesson's content. In other words, we check whether high learning performance is a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosing high levels of basic computational thinking skills. In this paper, we shortly describe the assessment tool we propose.},

The authors have developed a new information technology course with the focus on computational thinking. The research uses the convergent cognition theory as the theoretical framework. The convergent cognition theory posits that learning computer programming affects students' mathematical thinking and vice versa. The programming environment is Scratch. A group of third grade students and a group of fourth grade students are the participants. Their computational thinking skill and math ability will be measured to see whether this course develops students' computational thinking skill and whether convergent cognition effects exist. Examples from the instructional materials will be presented as part of the poster.

This new reality brings with it the need for children and young people to develop new basic skills linked to what has been called computational thinking. Computational thinking taught from an early age may allow individuals and society to understand and use new conceptual structures and models that represent complex phenomena and processes in the world around us. However, stimulating the development of computational thinking at an early age (preschool) continues to be an academic challenge whose approach requires research, interdisciplinary work, and innovation. My doctoral thesis aims to contribute to the design, development and evaluation of child-robot interaction (including programming interface, interaction context and activities), aimed at promoting the development of computational thinking in preschool children.},

abstract = {In this article I present a theoretical framework for the concept "computational thinking". I do so in response to some of the problems and consequences of the lack of viable theoretical foundations; especially in relation to the development in recent years of many educational practices that claim the term "computational thinking". I therefore introduce my extension of Jean Piaget's general law of cognition which arose as a result of my empirical research on novice learners knowledge of the concept of a program as an executable object. Said empirical study is briefly described in this paper as a means to highlight the key to my extension of Piaget's general law, which is the insight of how the thought processes and methods involved in cases where the subject must instruct an action to a computer differ from those in which the subject instructs another subject, or performs the action themselves. My theory explains the difference between algorithmic thinking and computational thinking by adequately locating it in the specificities of the subject instructing a computer. Hence, in this article I claim that my extension of Piaget's law offers a more empirically thorough and theoretically sound way forward in the conceptual development of "computational thinking" than the alternatives that are being debated in academia to the present day.},

abstract = {The usage of playful activities is common in introductory programming settings. There is normally a virtual character or a physical robot that has to collect items or reach a goal within a map. Visually, these activities tend to be exciting enough to maintain children engaged: there is constant feedback about the actions being performed, and the virtual environments tend to be stimulating and aesthetically pleasant. Conversely, in adaptations for visually impaired children, these environments tend to become poorer, damaging the story at the cost of the programming actions and its dull mechanics (e.g., place a arrow block to move the character forward). In this paper, we present TACTOPI, a playful environment designed from the ground up to be rich in both its story (a nautical game) and its mechanics (e.g., a physical robot-boat controlled with a 3D printed wheel), tailored to promote computational thinking at different levels (4 to 8 years old). This poster intends to provoke discussion and motivate accessibility researchers that are interested in computational thinking to make playfulness a priority.},

abstract = {The computational thinking evaluation in last five years (2016-2020) has allowed to stablish a diagnosis for new students of Information Technologies division at the Universidad Tecnol\'{o}gica de Puebla – Mexico. The immediate benefit has been the offer of learning scenarios for the programming methodology course that impacts the retention indicator. Women and men have benefited from this strategy, but no review of the results had been conducted to determine whether there is any difference in evaluation performance from a gender perspective. As in other countries, in Mexico there is an accentuated percentage difference in terms of men´s election for higher education studies in areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This article sets out the data analysis when evaluating five skills associated with the concept of computational thinking, this means, decomposition, abstraction, generalization, algorithmic design and evaluation. The conclusion of the analysis states that there is no significant gender difference in the results of evaluation. Women and men who enter to study the first semester have similar conditions and opportunities for learning the contents and consequently acquire the respective competencies.},

abstract = {In recent years, the elementary schools in Macao have increasingly offered programming curriculum. Programming curriculum emphasizes computational thinking, which is the capacity to analyze, design algorithms, and find solutions to programming problems. However, it is not easy to develop students’ computational thinking abilities. In addition, students' poor learning attitudes are connected to difficulties in learning programming. Therefore, it is crucial for educators to investigate how to improve students' computational thinking and learning attitudes. This study applied a quasi-experimental research method to a single group and used a pretest-posttest method to measure the influence of using Code.org on computational thinking and learning attitudes. The participants were 20 third-grade students in an elementary school in Macao. The teaching duration is carried out for three weeks, six lessons per week, a total of eighteen lessons, and 40 minutes per lesson. The Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS) and the Attitude Scale of Computer Programming Learning (ASCOPL) were used to evaluate the implementation's effect. After analyzing the questionnaire scores and students' achievements on the Code.org website, it was found that after receiving the Code.org instruction, students were able to complete most of the stage of the Course B curriculum in Code.org, and their computational thinking and learning attitudes have improved significantly.},

abstract = {Technology can be both a bane and a boon to education. Social media apps and digital games offer rich and highly stimulating forms of engagement outside of the classroom. This level of stimulus has created challenges for traditional educational paradigms and approaches. A promising response is for educators to embrace technology through interactive apps and gamification.This workshop provides hands-on engagement with a collection of freely-available interactive web apps that focus on the development of visual, spatial, and computational thinking. The workshop concludes with participants playing a third-person Unity game in which the (interactive) standalone web apps presented in the workshop have been embedded. The game, inspired by Han Solo's Kessel run, involves a trek across a sequence of platforms located in a galaxy far far away. Teleportation from one platform to the next is enabled by correctly completing the activity contained in the embedded (and interactive) web apps and then having the player walk through a portal. The player game score is calculated based on the speed and accuracy of their engagement with the exercises present.},

abstract = {In today's increasingly digital world, it is critical that all students learn to think computationally from an early age. Assessments of Computational Thinking (CT) are essential for capturing information about student learning and challenges. Several existing K-12 CT assessments focus on concepts like variables, iterations and conditionals without emphasizing practices like algorithmic thinking, reusing and remixing, and debugging. In this paper, we discuss the development of and results from a validated CT Practices assessment for 4th-6th grade students. The assessment tasks are multilingual, shifting the focus to CT practices, and making the assessment useful for students using different CS curricula and different programming languages. Results from an implementation of the assessment with about 15000 upper elementary students in Hong Kong indicate challenges with algorithm comparison given constraints, deciding when code can be reused, and choosing debugging test cases. These results point to the utility of our assessment as a curricular tool and the need for emphasizing CT practices in future curricular initiatives and teacher professional development.},

abstract = {Although Computational Thinking and Programming have become obligatory in many national curricula, the majority of teachers in practice are currently in dire need of support from both the research and teaching community. A national research and teacher development project was initiated in Sweden to address this issue. To develop their pedagogical competence in these new subjects, 31 in-service teachers from the project performed lesson studies at their schools. This study collected and analyzed the documentation of 12 lesson studies regarding how computational thinking skills are taught and assessed in K--9, with block-based programming. The study applies a validated CT framework to identify the involved computational thinking skills. The result presents a progression stage scheme for these skills in compulsory schools. The paper also discusses the problems and challenges in the assessment of computational thinking skills.},

abstract = {As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy education has recently shifted to fostering computing thinking ability as well as ICT use, many countries are conducting research on national curriculum and evaluation. In this study, we measured Korean students’ ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools.},

abstract = {With the advent of online educational platforms and the advances in pedagogical technologies, self-directed learning has emerged as one of the most popular modes of learning. Distance education---elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic---involves methods of instruction through a variety of remote activities which often rely on educational videos for mastery. In the absence of direct student engagement, the asynchronous nature of remote activities may deteriorate the quality of education for learners. Students often have an illusion of skill acquisition after watching videos, which results in overestimation of abilities and skills. We focus on the efficacy of skill acquisition through interactive technologies and assess their impact on computational thinking in comparison with delivery through other traditional media (e.g. videos and texts). In particular, we investigate the relationship between actual learning, perception of learning, and learners' confidence in adult learners. Our results reveal intriguing observations about the role of interactivity and visualization and their implications on the pedagogical design for self-directed learning modules.},

abstract = {This poster provides an overview of the goals and objectives of the New York City Department of Education's (NYCDOE) Hack League, a district-wide competition that invites middle and high school students with any level of CS experience to explore the systemic impacts and applications of computing. By requiring participants to interact with data and prototype a proposed solution to an issue that the data illuminates, students creatively engage in a human-centered design and strategic problem-solving process aimed at improving the quality of life and civic issues in their communities. Each stage of competition represents a component of the engineering design process, thereby encouraging students to be thoughtful programmers. Through three stages of competition, students identify an issue and validate it with data, outline and prototype a solution while incorporating feedback from industry professionals and subject matter experts, and build metrics into their product. Making open data accessible to students has proven to be an effective approach to developing citizen scientists in NYC. This competition could be replicated in districts anywhere in the country and can be organized within or across schools. It is a great way to encourage student development as civic-minded individuals, engagement with their local government and elected officials, and application of computational thinking and computer science skills.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is emerging as an important theme in computer science and high school education. However, research is needed to inform high-school teachers how to foster students' development of CT in computer science and other subjects. Evidence suggests that agent-based modeling is a valuable way for students to learn CT in different subjects. This paper reports a teaching experiment where researchers, developers, and high school teachers collaborated to develop six NetLogo models. The models were used in nine Danish High Schools in the following four subjects: Biotechnology, chemistry, biology, and social science. Teachers and students had no or very limited experience with programming. Students build CT and content knowledge by using, modifying, and creating code in the models. This paper provides details for others to adopt the models and the underlying CMC framework, which integrates: Coding, Modeling, and Content. The paper evaluates the results from an open-ended questionnaire with all participating students (n=210) and semi-structured interviews with all teachers (n=15). Thematic analysis was applied to categorize the qualitative data. Results showed that students were able to use, modify, and create code in NetLogo that enabled them to develop CT and content knowledge. The CMC framework represents a fruitful way for teachers to design and teach and for students to tinker with learning CT.},

The app includes two storytelling games where users create and listen to stories as well as four CT games where users then modify those stories to learn about sequences, loops, events, and variables. We improved upon the app design through wizard-of-oz testing (N = 28) and iterative design testing (N = 22) before conducting an evaluation study (N = 22). Children were successfully able to navigate the app, effectively learn about the target computing concepts, and, after using the app, children demonstrated above-chance performance on a near transfer CT concept recognition task.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking can be defined as a set of skills for problem solving based on Computer Science. Computational Thinking skills are not only limited to the field of computing but also extensible to all areas of knowledge. Young people grow up surrounded by technology but many of them go for university without any prior knowledge in computer science. Several initiatives have been created to promote Computational Thinking abilities in students all over the world. Teaching computational thinking must necessarily involve problem-solving, and can be applied to various types of problems that do not directly involve coding tasks. However, it is recognized to everyone that programming is a good way to improve Computational Thinking. In this article, we have done a survey on the existing tools that use the codification as main means of development of the abilities of computational thinking or not. It was also a concern to mention those that provide a wide variety of resources for teachers. This paper is an attempt to demonstrate the importance of computational thinking in the first beginning of learning programming, and what activities best contribute to increase the abilities of each computer engineering student in computational thinking according to the characteristics of those who attend the Polytechnic of Guarda, Portugal. Most of our students have never had the opportunity to learn computational thinking.},

abstract = {Developing computational thinking (CT) assessment methods appropriate for elementary students is attracting growing attention as CT research in elementary education progresses. To review the current elementary CT assessments for potential gaps, and seek additional methodologies to expand our understanding of CT, an integrative literature review of 75 research papers was performed in two phases. In Phase One, we conducted a critical analysis of existing elementary CT assessment studies. Key results include: 1) Artifact analysis, CT assessment items, and interviews are the most common methods utilized to assess CT in elementary grades; 2) Existing CT assessments primarily focus on students' computational artifacts and performance on CT tests; however, strategies to study students' thought processes during CT problem-solving are limited and under-utilized. Guided by the results of phase one, along with the theoretical perspective that connected CT to visual processing ability, in phase two we performed a survey of literature in the area of understanding cognitive processes through eye-tracking (i.e., visual attention) and think-aloud methodologies (i.e., verbalization). We focused on eye-tracking and think-aloud methodologies as these have been used to understand students' cognitive processes during problem-solving in other areas. Based on these findings, we proposed that in addition to current established methodologies, eye-tracking with the think-aloud technique can provide new insights into students' CT.},

Despite the undisputed importance of assessment, the fact is that there is not enough evidence on which abilities are merely theoretical and which can be empirically observed in the context of CT. This paper is part of a larger investigation in which we try to answer a simple question: can CT abilities be quantitatively defined and measured? In this particular study, we try to answer a simple question: How many CT abilities can be empirically observed using factor analysis? We approach this question, using a dataset containing answers of 1564 students from Lithuania in the Bebras Challenge from 2015. Firstly, we used confirmatory factor analysis to verify a theory that claims that five CT abilities are assessed by the contest. Our analysis shows the theory is not statistically supported. Secondly, we used principal component analysis as an exploratory analysis to try to derive an appropriate number of factors from the data. Surprisingly, the analysis suggests there are only two main recognizable factors. Finally, we briefly discuss these factors and hypothesize that the first is called evaluation ability, which would include abstraction, generalization, and decomposition, while factor 2 is algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning.},

abstract = {The acquisition of Computational Thinking (CT) skills is an essential goal of Computer Science (CS) education. Assessment of CT is critical for CS teaching and research. However, there is a paucity of developmentally appropriate CT measures designed for early elementary school children. Among existing measures, there has been little attention paid to methods for comparing CT skills across grades. In the present study, I examined the use of a normalized scoring system for comparing performance on three grade-specific versions of the TechCheck CT assessment. TechCheck is a brief, unplugged, multiple-choice instrument for children 5-9 years of age that probes six domains of CT. Baseline raw score TechCheck data from 596 students showed normal distributions with significant differences in means between grades. I calculated Z-scores and percentile ranks by grade. This normalization allowed for the comparison of CT skills within and across grades in the context of a pilot longitudinal study of the CAL-ScratchJr coding curriculum. Application of the normative scoring system showed a difference in the outcome of only 4 percentile ranks between first and second graders while raw scores indicated an improbable 45% difference. This study demonstrates that normalized TechCheck scores that take into account differences in the score distributions across grades can improve the measurement of CT skills in the context of early childhood CS educational interventions.},

In addition to UMC's continued application, it has recently been utilized to scaffold student learning in topics as diverse as machine learning, e-textiles, and computer programming. UMC has also been applied to instructional goals other than "supporting students in becoming creators of computational artifacts." This panel will re-examine the UMC progression and refine our understanding of when its use is suitable, and when not, and share findings on evaluations and extensions to UMC that are productive in new and different contexts.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is seen as one of the core elements fostered in STEM education, and many countries prepare and implement curricula for its development. Researchers realize that the development of CT in students at the elementary and middle school levels not only enables earlier use of CT, but also can better solute the problems in their daily learning. This study investigated the impact of self-directed learning on the development of CT in a block-based programming course. Using Pre- and posttest quasi-experimental research method, 128 students from a middle school were selected. Through the CT skill scale, the CT self-efficacy scale, and semistructured interviews, the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed after four months of interventions. The findings revealed that the self-directed learning had a positive impact on middle school students’ CT skill and self-efficacy. Therefore, results revealed that self-directed learning is one of the effective learning strategies for developing CT of middle school students.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a popular phrase that refers to a collection of computational ideas and habits of mind that people in computing disciplines acquire through their work in designing programs, software, simulations, and computations performed by machinery. Recently a computational thinking for K-12 movement has spawned initiatives across the education sector, and educational reforms are under way in many countries. However, modern CT initiatives should be well aware of the broad and deep history of computational thinking, or risk repeating already refuted claims, past mistakes, and already solved problems, or losing some of the richest and most ambitious ideas in CT. This paper presents an overview of three important historical currents from which CT has developed: evolution of computing's disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing, educational research and efforts in computing, and emergence of computational science and digitalization of society. The paper examines a number of threats to CT initiatives: lack of ambition, dogmatism, knowing versus doing, exaggerated claims, narrow views of computing, overemphasis on formulation, and lost sight of computational models.},

Building on prior methods used with the digital science learning games, Impulse and Quantum Spectre, we are combining video analysis and educational data mining to identify implicit computational thinking that emerges through gameplay [1]. This paper reports on the first phase of this process: developing a human labeling system for evidence of specific CT skills (e.g., problem decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmic thinking, abstraction) in three Zoombinis puzzle by analyzing video data from a sample of elementary learners, middle school learners, game experts, and computer scientists. Future work will combine these human-labeled video data with game log data from these 70+ learners and computer scientists to create automated assessments of implicit computational thinking skills from gameplay behaviors in large player audiences. This poster with video examples will share results of this work-in-progress.},

We first analyze existing research on teaching computational thinking to middle school students in Brazil. Then, the tools and methods used in those works in light of CVM. Our findings show positive results regarding the possibility of using CVM as a foundation to classify tools and methods for teaching CT.},

The goal is to focus on the structuring of the semantic relationships among the logical building blocks to yield solutions to computational problems. In this paper, we introduce a new programming platform, called the CodeMapper, in which learners are able to build computational logic in independent modules and aggregate them to create complex modules. CodeMapper is an abstract development environment in which rapid visual prototyping of systems is possible by combining already developed independent modules in logical steps.},

abstract = {There are increasing calls for mathematics teachers to foster computational thinking (CT) skills in their lessons and align them with existing curricula and national educational policies. Algorithmic thinking (AT) and generalization are two key elements of CT that are often underrepresented in traditional mathematics lessons. This study investigated how to address AT and generalization aspects in 12th-grade calculus lessons using the dynamic mathematics software GeoGebra. We present a six-lesson intervention designed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and teachers with a background in computer science and mathematics education that aims to foster pre-university students’ AT and generalization skills in calculus lessons. We evaluated the intervention in a 15 students classroom in the Netherlands through the analysis of students’ workbooks, files, interviews, and the teacher’s logbook. The findings suggest that the intervention was favorably seen by both the teacher and the students, and that their learning and teaching experience was highly satisfactory. The most common challenges for successfully completing the designed material included issues related to getting familiar with GeoGebra, syntax, and effectively using conditional statements. Finally, we report on the learning and teaching experience and discuss strategies to address AT and generalization aspects for teachers who wish to address such CT aspects in mathematics lessons.},

abstract = {In Latin America, computational thinking workshops are mostly developed in urban areas, charging participation fees. And although teachers are increasingly being expected to include technology in their classrooms, computational thinking and programming are not mandatory topics in teacher training programs. This hinders the development of digital skills among Latino students, and we expect that the digital gap between urban and rural populations will expand over time, especially in socio-economically vulnerable populations. Believing that teachers can be agents of change, we designed a 12 hour workshop to train the K-8 teaching staff in a rural and vulnerable school. The goal of this experience was to help these teachers develop basic computational thinking skills and devise new ways to incorporate what they learned in their classrooms. In this paper, we report our experience facilitating this workshop, and analyze the teacher perceptions before and after the intervention. Teacher attitudes changed drastically during the execution of the workshop, and they were able to come up with creative ways of incorporating computational thinking activities into their subjects. The reported experience can be used as input to develop public policies with respect to how computational thinking should be introduced in rural and vulnerable environments.},

Several off-the-shelf technologies exist to promote computational abilities with the support of block-based programming and working hardware. However, in some contexts, a significant limitation is the complexity and costs that carry the acquisition and implementation of working hardware such as Educational Robots. In this paper, we discuss a strategy to reinforce the learning of Computational Thinking (CT) skills by providing an analogous method to Educational Robots. We offer an affordable solution to assist high school students to build a CT-based software/hardware integrated solution. We executed this strategy in a coding bootcamp where students were required to design and implement an algorithm, and illustrate its execution in software and hardware. The proposed exercise delivered the expected results engaging students to ideate the solution of a problem, implement an algorithm, and create a physical demonstration of it.},

We conducted 12 play sessions with 12 children (4 girls and 8 boys) with diverse backgrounds belonging to three different schools for the blind. We briefly present the reasons for play being central to our effort of bringing computational thinking to children who are blind and low vision in India, and share some experiences of the children and some insights that we have gathered so far: Children not only enjoyed every session, they rapidly moved from playing with pre-created examples, to making changes, to demanding that their favorite stories be told. In observing such play, we could infer that they have grasped the basic concepts of computational thinking? flow of control, variables, loops? though not articulated in that vocabulary.},

abstract = {Many programs offer informal experiences in programming for select students who may qualify or whose parents pay fees for attending. Integrating computational thinking (CT) in the formal classroom setting provides equal opportunities to develop valuable problem-solving skills for all students. However, such integration poses challenges since teachers may have limited experiences in computing and may be pressured by time constraints due to the need to cover Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as well as district specific initiatives. A 2-year intervention has been designed to target upper elementary level self-contained classrooms to increase teachers' knowledge and ability for integrating CT into science lessons. Twenty teachers from four school districts in Southern California participated in the first year of the project's professional development activities. These schools have varying levels of diversity and socioeconomic status of student populations. Instead of using popular drag-and-drop programming tools such as Scratch or Tynker, the first year of the project focused on key CT concepts and helped teachers connect these concepts with skills important for student success in science activities. This paper reports on the study of the project's impact on student learning of key CT concepts among students from project classrooms. The main elements of the professional development are also described.},

abstract = {Computer science education is more important than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our society's reliance on computing and its power to help businesses innovate and adapt, yet at the same time has surfaced greater disparities for students studying computer science. Computing is the number one source of all new wages in our economy, and there are currently 400,000 open computing jobs across the United States. However, unequal access to computer science instruction and opportunities to engage in computational thinking and practices remain prevalent (Google &amp; Gallup, 2015). In the 2018-19 school year, only 15 percent of Maryland graduates took at least one computing related course, and there were significant gaps in the course taking patterns by gender and race (Maryland Center for Computing Education, 2021). To grow students' competencies with computational thinking and computer science, it is essential to build the capacity of teachers to integrate computational thinking competencies and standards into their practice. The Frostburg State University College of Education's Maryland Accelerates (MA) Program provides aspiring teachers the opportunity to earn an accelerated Master of Arts in Teaching (Elementary or Secondary track) degree along with an innovative yearlong teacher residency in partnership with Frederick and Garrett County Public Schools. One of the primary goals of the program is to integrate mathematical problem solving and computational thinking to promote scientific inquiry in partnering elementary and secondary schools. To this end, Frostburg State University has developed an exciting opportunity for Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) students to earn a microcredential in Computational Thinking that is aligned to the ISTE Educator Standards, the High Leverage Practice Standards from TeachingWorks, and the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium InTASC Model as part of their teacher preparation program. In this panel, faculty from the Computer Science Department and the College of Education at Frostburg State University will discuss their partnership to develop a microcredential for Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers, how and why the credential was developed, and what competencies aspiring teachers develop. Two recent graduates of the Maryland Accelerates MAT Teacher Residency program will discuss their experience using these skills and knowledge during their residency and how they plan to apply and integrate computational thinking into their practice as new teachers.},

abstract = {Educational robotics and physical computing have proved to be good sources of motivation for students of all ages and school levels. We conducted a series of workshops in the primary schools of city of Joensuu in eastern Finland, focusing on training the fundamental computational thinking (CT) skills by using a programmable and interactive Teddy Bear toy. Educational robotics and physical computing devices have proved to be an efficient way to teach these skills regardless the students’ age group or previous background. To assess the students’ intrinsic motivation towards Teddy Bear programming, we devised a survey for workshop participants and conducted a statistical analysis to compare differences between the genders and age groups. The results of the large-scale empirical study (n=1440) show that the students at the age of 9-10 years (Grades 3-4) are significantly more motivated towards such a learning tool than the students of age 11-12 years (Grades 5-6). Furthermore, we show that especially young girls find the Teddy Bear programming motivating and they are eager to learn more. This indicates that appealing tools play a key role when teaching programming and CT concepts to young school children.},

In this project, supported through a grant from the Maryland Center for Computing Education (cs4md.org), we developed a pilot computational thinking course blending computer science majors and pre-service teachers. The course focused on describing and integrating computational thinking in a way that would translate to K-12 classrooms while utilizing non-programming based computational tools to demonstrate these ideas. Participants were able to put these ideas into practice in K-8 classrooms during the course and reflect on how the lessons were received. We discuss the implementation of the course, field placement, motivations, and our initial analysis of survey data, including impacts on attitudes on education as a career choice for computer science majors.},

In this study, social stories are used to teach autistic children social skills. Combining sequential computational thinking as a learning strategy and applying Conductive Copper Foil Tape and Makey Makey, a social story teaching aid is made. With the help of it, children can learn the content from social stories, learn social stories through computational thinking and arrange corresponding sequence structure. Three autistic children from Grade 1 took part in six teaching experiments and were observed their change of social skills. The results showed that scientific teaching aid could improve autistic children's social ability, speaking skills, attention, and learning interests, making them observe the storytelling more carefully and easily, understand the story development, and learn social skills from it. Besides, this teaching aid could improve autistic children's social reciprocity and provide theoretical references for relevant fields.},

It is in fact that most research work in Computation Thinking have served for students but much less for teachers. College teachers in China took less systematic training in order to adequately prepare them for increasingly higher teaching requirements. To address this issue, this paper first proposes an outcomes-based teacher education program distinguished from CT principles under teaching and learning perspective, decomposed an abstract computational thinking idea into a definite coursework content. This paper then describe an outcomes-based evaluative frame which supports teachers to ensure a successful application of CT theories and concepts into practical skill development. Results from practice showed that the current research work is effective and widely accepted for which evidence is also provided.},

Homeschool groups try to address this issue, cooperatively educating their children. We were contacted by such a group that wanted to introduce their children to computational thinking (CT). These children, aged 7-11, have showed an interest in technology, and use online educational resources. None of the parents felt capable of tutoring the group about CT. They also worried about losing control about how their children interact with technology. We report an intervention over 9 months to introduce eleven young homeschoolers to CT in a suburban environment, describing the impact on parent and children attitudes towards technology and CT. We conclude with three lessons: 1)~science-related activities should be used to introduce CT among homeschoolers, 2) "success'' is establishing a meaningful relationship with a homeschool group, and 3) activities designed for school children need to be adapted to the homeschooling context.},

Coding games and problem solving exercises have been growing in popularity. Many large-scale initiatives have been launched in order to bring these initiatives into classrooms, from preschool to secondary education. CodyColor is a simplified coding game, which takes basic programming instructions representing movements ("turn left" and "turn right") and represents them with color blocks. In contrast to most other coding games, color-coded programming relies on no symbolic interpretation on part of the player in order to be approachable by very young players as well. We present a massively multiplayer online version of CodyColor, discuss design and implementation specifics, and enumerate some of the possible game modes.},

In this study, data embedding technology was adopted to collect data on students' operational behavior in answering questions, and learning analytic techniques (i.e., semantic analysis, lagged sequence analysis, etc.) were used to evaluate computational thinking. Students with higher- and lower-level of computational thinking were compared on their behavioral patterns in a seriel events in the computational thinking training process. An event graph was constructed to represent the computational thinking behaviors based on logical event relationships. This study provides insights on a novel approach of analyzing computational thinking from the procedural perspective, which could be helpful for understanding how the thinking path is structured during problem-solving process.},

We used a mixed-methods approach to assess how the curricular integration of robotics and science experimentation advances students’ CT skills and perceptions of computation in science. We identified growth in CT skills, specifically regarding Algorithmic Thinking. Students identified as key advantages of this approach the increased precision in experimental procedures, time-efficiency, and easier debugging.

This study analyzes students' collaborative learning experiences within small interdisciplinary "cohorts" while learning computational thinking in a university-level class. The cohort allows students from different disciplines to contribute diverse perspectives, socially interact with each other and in turn create situations where two or more students learn together. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative means to explore students' collaborative learning experiences. Ethnographically-informed qualitative data using Stahl's collaborative framework is analyzed. The analysis revealed that most students found the cohort model to be valuable in learning computational thinking by allowing them to ask about and explain problems, especially with students from different disciplines who perceive and explain a problem differently. Quantitative data from a multi-term survey complements and confirms the findings from the qualitative data.

abstract = {As final event of the project "Informatics - A Child's Play?!", which aimed at introducing computational thinking in primary and secondary schools, the authors initiated the first Children's Congress in 2016 with the main theme of "Languages - Pictures - Information". This is now an annual event, where all participating children can slip into the role of researchers and present the results of their projects accomplished together with their teachers as well as teacher students of different master courses. As preparation the project teams get an introduction into computational thinking and several computer science concepts with the task of applying at least one of them in their project and the development of creative products. The themes of the Children's Congress are relatively open and fit into every subject, because our main aim is introducing computational thinking "by the way" to all participants. During their work on cross-curricular or even subject specific projects, pupils, students and teachers learn that basics of computational thinking are or can be integrated in every subject. This paper reports on the implementation and procedure of the Children's Congress and gives an overview of the projects accomplished in the first two years (2016 and 2017). It describes how and where computational thinking has been integrated and presents the main results of the evaluation gained from interviews and questionnaires.},

abstract = {This study examined how computational thinking (CT) has been used to teach problem-solving skills and programming education in the recent past. This study specifically (i) identified articles that discussed CT approach for programming education at higher education institutions (HEIs), (ii) classified the different CT approaches and tools employed for programming education at HEIs, (iii) synthesised and discussed results that are reported by relevant studies that utilized CT for teaching programming at HEIs. A systematic literature review methodology was adopted in this study. Out of 161 articles retrieved, 33 of them that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Our study revealed that the use of CT at HEIs for programming education began in 2010; many studies did not specify the context of use, but the use of CT is found to be gaining grounds in many contexts, especially the developed countries; course design approach was mostly employed by educators to introduce CT at HEIs for programming education. Furthermore, this study pointed out how CT approach can be explored for designing a smart learning environment to support students in learning computer programming.},

abstract = {Even though the computer science education community has not definitively established exactly what ?Computational Thinking" entails, most will agree that it is using a computing machine to solve problems. Like all tools for solving problems, this knowledge should be made available to everyone. Jeannette Wing sounded this call in 2006, writing that "computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone." These skills are not just for computer scientists, but for anyone and everyone who plans to solve problems. We already teach other forms of problem solving to all our students including: Mathematical Thinking, Critical Thinking, and Scientific Reasoning. Computational Thinking, as well as engineering and design's Design Thinking, should be equally exposed to all students. It is also important to illuminate that these tools are not used in isolation to solve problems. Perhaps the key to the acceptance of Computational Thinking (as well as Design Thinking) as essential educational tools is to highlight their overlap and interdependence with other problem solving skills. The next generation will need practice with every tool at their disposal to be prepared to solve tomorrow's problems. I propose embedding Computational Thinking in a problem solving framework that leverages teachers' (and students') existing knowledge of problem solving in mathematics, science, and language arts in order to encourage teachers in non CS disciplines to teach Computational Thinking in their classrooms.},

However, such environments can be challenging to some students due to their highly open-ended nature. We propose to alleviate this difficulty by learning interpretable student models from data that can drive personalization of a real-world GD learning environment to the student’s needs. We apply our approach on a dataset collected in ecological settings and evaluate the ability of the generated student models at predicting ineffective learning behaviors over the course of the interaction. We then discuss how these behaviors can be used to define personalized support in GD learning activities, by conducting extensive interviews with experienced instructors.},

abstract = {Introducing coding in the curriculum at an early age is considered a long term investment in bridging the skills gap between the technology demands of the labour market and the availability of people to fill them. The keys to success include moving from mere literacy to active control - not only at the level of learners but also at the level of teachers. However, given the fast development of the field, one might wonder whether acquiring specific coding skills really is the essence of introducing coding early in the curriculum. We argue that the reach of ICT -including coding skills- is much broader than STEM alone and a background in STEM is no longer a requirement for successful coding. The complex link between coding and computational thinking is the real critical success factor. We refer to TACCLE3 (an EU Erasmus+ project) as a successful approach to the implementation and valorisation of computational thinking across the curriculum.},

abstract = {Elementary schools throughout the United States are attempting to integrate computational thinking (CT) into their instruction, often without guidance from research about effective approaches for achieving particular CT goals. This cross-case study investigated the school-wide integration of CT in three elementary schools in a large urban school district in the Northeast that has a district-led CS for All initiative. Data included interviews with teachers, professional development providers, and school administrators as well as surveys from teachers and classroom observations in each participating school. Findings revealed three distinct approaches to integration: (a) single teacher leader-driven model, (b) scaffolded professional development model, and (c) intensive coaching model. These approaches reflect the visions set by administrators and teachers, methods used by professional development providers, and cultures of each school. Across the case studies, common pedagogical approaches included strategic use of both unplugged and plugged activities with a range of computational tools, a focus on collaborative project-based learning, and the use of CT-specific academic language to anchor new CT learning within the academic disciplines. The study highlighted advantages and challenges within each integration approach with implications for schools considering CT integration.},

Yet, it is unclear how and if the game genre of student-designed games impact CT and programming. We explore how game genre impacts CT development and programming routines in Scratch games designed by 8th-grade students using a metrics-based approach (i.e., Dr. Scratch). Our findings show that designing particular games (e.g., action, storytelling) impact CT and programming development. We observe, for instance, that CT skills develop and consolidate fast, after which students can focus on aspects more specific to game design. Based on the results, we suggest that researchers and educators in constructionist learning consider the impact of game genre when designing game-based curricula for the learning of programming and CT.},

abstract = {With national K-12 education initiatives such as "CSForAll," block-based programming environments have emerged as widely used tools for teaching novice programming. A key challenge presented by block-based programming environments is assessing students' computational thinking (CT) and programming competencies. Developing assessment methods that can evaluate students' use of CT practices such as testing and refining, and developing and using appropriate algorithms, can help teachers evaluate students learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. In this work, we utilize an evidence-centered assessment design approach to devise a three-dimensional assessment to evaluate students' CT competencies based on evidence extracted from their programming trajectories in a block-based programming environment. In this assessment, the first dimension assesses students' knowledge of essential CT concepts, the second dimension assesses students' dynamic testing and refining strategies, and the third dimension assesses their overall problem-solving efficiency. We apply the assessment framework to data collected from students' interactions with a game-based learning environment designed to develop middle-grade students' CT competencies and programming skills. The results demonstrate that students' knowledge of basic CT constructs, such as appropriate use and combination of control structures, serves as the foundation for designing and implementing effective algorithms. Further, we assessed students testing and refining strategies over the three dimensions of novelty, positivity, and scale. The results demonstrate that students with higher algorithmic capabilities tend to make more novel, positive, and small-scale changes. The results reveal distinctive patterns in students' approaches to computational thinking problem solving and make a step toward identifying and assessing productive computational thinking practices.},

In order to gain the knowledge required to teach these skills, a cohort of math teachers participated in an in-service training scheme conducted as a massive open online course (MOOC). This paper analyses the success of this training scheme and uses the results of the study to focus on the skills of computational thinking, and to explore how math teachers expect to integrate computing into the K-12 math syllabus. The coursework and feedback from the MOOC course indicate that they readily associate computational thinking with problem solving in math. In addition, some of the teachers are inspired by the new opportunities to be creative in their teaching. However, the set of programming concepts they refer to in their essays is insubstantial and unfocused, so these concepts are consolidated here to form a hypothetical learning trajectory for computational thinking.},

abstract = {In recent years, several visual programming languages and tools are emerging, which allow young students to easily program applications. Particularly, the block-based language used by Scratch has been the standard in most school initiatives to introduce Computational thinking (CT) in courses unrelated to computing. However, CT competences are not specifically included in the curricula of many Higher Education degrees that future teachers of Primary and Secondary Education have to complete. This paper describes a workshop for teachers' training on CT. It is based on the block-based common language of Scratch, but focused on enhancing teachers' skills to develop mobile applications with a tool based on the MIT's AppInventor. This workshop provided some insights on the capabilities of future teachers in the use of programming tools1.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been significant interest in integrating Maker-related experiences into formal education. A challenge is reconciling open-ended making and non-deterministic learning goals with standards that drive traditional education. In the context of our CS-focused STEM magnet school, we designed two 2nd grade lessons that not only align with grade-level standards and our school's computer science-oriented pedagogy, but also incorporate 3D printing and the philosophy of Makerspaces. The integrated Maker experience serves to scaffold computational thinking practices such as abstraction, modeling, and decomposition, which are essential for long-term success in STEM learning. To bring these aspects together, we created a rubric based on existing evaluation tools. Using this rubric, we evaluated the two lessons with a small sample of participants. Our pilot study shows promise of mastery in standard-related content, evidence of a making mindset, engagement in the activity, innovation in design, and solidarity in working with peers. Aligning state standards with open-ended Maker activities has potential for fostering student growth and engagement in the classroom. An additional component of our research was reflecting on our experience as teachers with no Makerspace experience who were newly submerged in the digital fabrication world. We present the two 3D printing-based lessons, one addressing extreme weather standards, the other incorporating understanding of urban, suburban, and rural communities. We also present the rubric we designed, the literature that guided this work, and reflections and recommendations from our experience of learning digital fabrication for the first time and integrating it into curriculum.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a set of concepts and problem-solving skills that are not only imperative for computer scientists, but important and applicable to nearly every discipline. CT skills are essential in a world where technology is ubiquitous. In the past decade, many efforts have been made to develop and evaluate computational thinking in primary and secondary students. Promoting CT skills in these young students can help reduce the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM careers since students who are exposed to CT at an early age are more likely to pursue a STEM discipline in college [18].This paper describes the COSMIC program, funded by Google's Tides Foundation, that introduces middle school students to CS and CT using the CS First curriculum and Scratch. The COSMIC activities spanned three years directly serving 700 students through 175 distinct events. Females comprised 51.1% of the individuals served, and 10.2% of those served were part of a minority group. The COSMIC activities allowed the researchers to investigate the effectiveness of the CS First curriculum. Using the Hairball-powered Dr. Scratch analysis tool on the curricular projects, the paper reports on the efficacy of the CS First curriculum in terms of its coverage of vital CT concepts and its success in transferring those concepts to middle school students.},

abstract = {Technologies of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have contributed significantly to the emergence of the Knowledge Society. However, there is a strong gender gap in the field of science and technology due to the influence of the male-centered culture that persists today. Computational thinking is presented as a way to develop in children from an early age the ability to solve problems, designing systems and understanding human behavior while using the fundamental concepts of computing. This factor allows girls to be in touch with technology in a fun and meaningful way; so as to balance the male and female presence in science and technology, achieving a more egalitarian system. In this article is presented a systematic review of the literature which indicates that few studies about computational thinking are working from a gender perspective, although some countries have already opted for teaching computer in the classroom. In addition, the review shows some methodologies which are using languages and suitable tools in order to work the computational thinking. Notwithstanding, It can be the basis for a proposal to integrate the gender perspective. In turn, it is committed to the creation of a methodological guide that encourages this teaching in national and international schools.},

In this study, we examine implicit computational thinking (CT) skills of 72 upper elementary and middle school students and 10 computer scientists playing a game called Pizza Pass. We report on the process of creating automated detectors to identify four CT skills from gameplay: problem decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmic thinking, and abstraction. This paper reports on hand-labeled playback data obtaining acceptable inter-rater reliability and 100 gameplay features distilled from digital log data. In future work, we will mine these features to automatically identify the CT skills previously labeled by humans. These automated detectors of CT will be used to analyze gameplay data at scale and provide actionable feedback to teachers in real-time.},

In this report, we examine the affordances of using a sensor platform to support the integration of disciplinary learning and computational thinking (CT) aligned with Next Generation Science Standards and the CT in STEM Taxonomy developed by Weintrop and colleagues. In the first unit, students investigated the conditions for mold growth within their school using a custom sensor system. After analyzing implementation experiences and student interest data, our team engaged in another round of co-design to develop a second instructional unit. This unit uses a different sensor system (the micro:bit) which supports additional CT in STEM practices due to its block-based programming interface and its real time data display. For the second unit we selected a different phenomenon: understanding and designing maglev trains.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill for students in the 21st century, providing a set of problem-solving methods that involve formulating problems and solutions in a form that can be carried out by an information-processing agent across a variety of fields. In addition, research shows that the integration of CT in education has the potential to improve the problem-solving skills of K-12 students. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a CT experimental course on 94 primary school students' perceptions of their problem-solving skills as well as possible correlations between the variables concerning the students' perceptions. Participants worked in pairs in the context of Scratch, a block-based visual programming language, and the data were collected through the Problem-Solving Inventory for Children (PSIC). A one-group pretest-posttest was conducted and the results suggest that a CT course can improve participants' overall perceptions of their problem-solving skills. Finally, increases in the participants' levels of control over emotions and behavior when facing problems were correlated with increases in their will to face their problems rather than avoid them.},

abstract = {Work in culturally responsive pedagogy and culturally responsive computing (CRC)(Scott, et al., 2014) holds promise for how to include underrepresented students into making communities as they develop their computational thinking (CT) skills. Cultural responsiveness involves instructors using what they know about students' individual identities to develop learning opportunities; having high expectations; and understanding students' sociopolitical contexts (Ladson-Billings, 1995). By integrating these approaches, students encounter a makerspace without pre-determined cultural norms that encourages questioning assumptions that limit the development of inclusive technology. This poster explores preliminary results from a mixed methods multiple case study. Sixteen high school students participated in a two-week summer making program that focused on CT and physics skills. Students shared elements of their identities, brought in artifacts for "show and tell", collected data on how they spend their time, and categorized assets in their communities to then incorporate into their own projects. Researchers analyzed classroom observations, videos, interviews, and student notebooks, as well as students' pre-post tests and attitudinal surveys. Findings reflect the importance of valuing student identity, building community, and highlighting how CT and physics affect students' lives.

One can learn computational concepts by taking a traditional course offered in a school or by self-guided learning through an online platform. Whatever the form of learning, computational concepts can be difficult to fully comprehend for novices. Collaborative learning has been considered effective in reducing learner's anxiety and in helping struggling learners overcome common learning difficulties. The proposed dissertation study aims to investigate how collaboration impacts learning of CT across both classroom setting and in an online learning community.

The proposal is based on correspondence with three of five change trends that integrated the educational model. Regarding the Knowledge society, promote recognition of the individuality of the student as a person who will do university studies, that is, the scenarios respond to the fact that each person learns differently. In the Training of competences, contribute with preventive actions that the teacher communicates when there is a lack of specific skills. Finally, in the Flexibility and articulation, provide a diagnostic tool that favors the recognition of previous competences to have an articulated beginning of studies based on the needs of the student. Consequently, contribute to the INACAP's educational model.},

abstract = {Using, processing and evaluating digitized information is relevant to every subject in primary and secondary school education. As this information is represented, modified and perceived through analog and digital media, competencies including critical reflection, knowledge, usage, and creation of information and media have been included in the German education system. Due to the highly inter- and transdisciplinary character of these skills, the development of a combined information and media literacy to teach the critical handling, reflection and design of information and (digital) media similar to a classical literacy concerning reading and writing skills. As this skill is fundamental for understanding the everyday digital environment, Computational Thinking poses a central idea of information and media literacy in order to understand how information of the real or fictional world are represented through digital media, how this digitized information is automaticly processed and displayed using media systems as well as how the resulting representations are interpreted. Information and media literacy adresses every subject and school type which is why it has to be integrated into future teacher education curricula. This paper shows the conception and implementation of an Information and Media Literacy certificate for student teachers with a focus on Computational Thinking. Based on recent studies, established curricula for Media Literacy, Computer Literacy and Digital Literacy as well as present Bavarian school curricula for Computer Science, we built the curriculum for the Computational Thinking part of the certificate upon fundamental ideas of Computer Science: Representation of Information, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Networks, Data Integrity and Data Security, Languages, and Physical Computing.},

Currently, contents and methods of basic computer course teaching in college have been unable to meet the actual needs to develop CT ability. This paper firstly makes an analysis of possible reasons for the above challenge and then aimed to how to teach and what to teach in a practical way. Our research discussed the basic concept and research status of "computing culture" discussed and extracted above 60 typical cases based "computing culture". These cases focused on discovery joinery of prophetic computer scientists etc. As the main line of teaching, these cases run through in-class teaching and organize every teaching step, such as leading-in, explanation, discussion, dialogue, and conclusion and so on. The several years teaching practice prove the strategies for teaching design put forward in this study is effective to foster a student's sense of "computing" and to arouse the students' interest. The finding concludes that developing the broader value of computing-culture and continued investing in the refine of computing-culture based cases are valuable.},

abstract = {The contiguity of physical and digital content of embodied learning has been shown to increase student's engagement in educational contexts. Applications with various kinds of physical interactions have been deployed to enhance the learning experiences in many engineering domains. However, even though computer science education (CSE) is one of zestful topics in the recent years, there are few studies focusing on the embodiment of CSE materials, by which the abstract and intangible concepts could be transformed into an intuitive affordance that utilizes sensorimotor experiences during the learning process. We propose an augmented embodiment mobile app designed for computational thinking (CT), specifically the debugging practices and abstraction concept, that makes use of gestures and augmented reality for learners to interact with the content. We examine the logic by the design framework for embodied learning and discuss potential extensions of multimodal analytics in such an application. Our preliminary user study in a middle school shows students' engagement in the application, however, it also reflected several design issues that need to be solved in the next iteration. The future plan of data analysis and experiments is also discussed.},

This study measures pre/post gains with new computational thinking assessments given to middle school students who participated in a virtual robotics programming curriculum. Overall, participation in the virtual robotics curriculum was related to significant gains in pre- to posttest scores, with larger gains for students who made further progress through the curriculum. The success of this intervention suggests that participation in a scaffolded programming curriculum, within the context of virtual robotics, supports the development of generalizable computational thinking knowledge and skills that are associated with increased problem-solving performance on nonrobotics computing tasks. Furthermore, the particular units that students engage in may determine their level of growth in these competencies.},

abstract = {This study seeks to extend the existing research on the use of visual programming tools to work and develop computational thinking. We show the primary education students' perceptions of the use of the software Lego Education WeDo in the subject of natural sciences to promote the computational thinking. We tried to test the following hypotheses: Students will learn to build and program 3D models with Lego Education WeDo (H1), students will think creatively to solve the problems (H2), Lego Education WeDo will help pupils to know the relationship between cause and effect (H3), and the tasks developed will allow pupils to reflect about the possibilities they have and to find the correct answer (H4). Based on the result analysis there were evidences of the effectiveness of the project to increase the participants' awareness of the computational thinking. The research also concluded that according to learners' perception, the way in which activities were designed provided them possibilities to learn to build models in 3D and program them. Moreover, the findings of the study also demonstrated that the success of the project also depended on the teacher's role as a guide in the teaching-learning process.},

The activity used the Balance of Equations game, built on the Scratch programming environment with the objective of teaching the initial ideas of first degree equations to a class with a learning gap in this discipline. The planning of the activity was divided into three moments, with the intention of starting from an analogy to the principle of equivalence of an equation, reaching the algebraic transcription of an equation through activities of manipulation of the game code. Seven concepts related to computational thinking with strong potential to be worked during the activity were identified. In this way, besides the presentation of the classroom case, this article identifies these seven concepts, analyzing how they could be developed during the application of the activity, seeking to answer the following question: How can computational thinking skills be explored through hands-on activity for the teaching of equations?},

We then proposed the whole set of tasks, with some of them modified, to pupils who had not participated to the challenge in November and compared performances in the two sessions. Using Item Response Theory, we measured the change in the distribution of difficulty and discrimination of the modified tasks. On the basis of the obtained results, we tried to better understand the many factors which influenced the difference in performances, both in the conceptual and cognitive task content and in its presentation (text, images, layout).},

Its goal is to disseminate among teachers in Italian primary and secondary schools a better awareness of informatics as the scientific basis of digital technologies. The project has adapted Code.org learning material and has introduced it to Italian schools with the support of a dedicated web site. Response has been enthusiastic in terms of participation: in two years more than one million students have been engaged and have completed a total of 10 million hours of informatics in schools. Almost all students found the material useful and were interested, teachers have reported. They have also declared to have experienced high satisfaction and a low level of difficulty. A detailed analysis of quantitative and qualitative data about the project is presented and areas for improvement are identified. One of the most interesting observations appears to corroborate the hypothesis that an exposure to informatics since the early age is important to attract students independently from their gender.},

abstract = {Computational thinking is nowadays being widely adopted and investigated. Educators and researchers are using two main approaches to teach these skills in schools: with computer programming exercises, and with unplugged activities that do not require the use of digital devices or any kind of specific hardware. While the former is the mainstream approach, the latter is especially important for schools that do not have proper technology resources, Internet connections or even electrical power. However, there is a lack of investigations that prove the effectiveness of the unplugged activities in the development of computational thinking skills, particularly for primary schools. This paper, which summarizes a quasi-experiment carried out in two primary schools in Spain, tries to shed some light on this regard. The results show that students in the experimental groups, who took part in the unplugged activities, enhanced their computational thinking skills significantly more than their peers in the control groups who did not participate during the classes, proving that the unplugged approach may be effective for the development of this ability.},

The first intervention involved evaluation of computational thinking through abilities of Generalization, Decomposition, Abstraction, Evaluation and Algorithmic Design, then students were offered 10 learning scenarios for Methodology of programming course. In the second intervention, 4 elements were manipulated to offer options in course of Programming, which were contents, modes of work, rhythms and time, and evaluation. In both interventions, use of Moodle platform allowed to expose learning contents and to have an appropriate context chosen by students. The main result was to generate personalized education as well as a learning experience that contributed to motivation of student in harmony with academic goals of initial programming courses.},

The educators cited deficient school resources as a possible barrier to implementation, but the introduction of the Raspberry Pi holds promise for mitigating this.

abstract = {Recently, Computer Science education in Switzerland reached a critical milestone. In the past two years the School of Education of FHNW, one of Switzerland's largest schools of education, introduced a mandatory Computer Science education module, comprised of a two-course sequence for its students: pre-service primary-level schoolteachers. Due to its design and audience, this mandatory module introduces a variety of unique challenges. The module is taken by a majority of female students (75%), many with no prior experience and/or interest in programming and Computer Science. The module starts with a course focused on learning Computational Thinking, referred to as FW, followed by a course focused on teaching Computational Thinking, referred to as FD. Since 2017, 1000 pre-service primary-level teachers have been trained in Computer Science education through this module. This curricula initiative computes the effect sizes from teaching two complete iterations of the "FW then FD" design. It is based on attitude assessment data collected at four points: Pre-FW, Post-FW, Pre-FD, Post-FD, during the first two years of this mandatory module. Our research indicates that, by course's end, pre-service teachers are mostly confident in their ability to program and think computationally.},

abstract = {We are developing ways to teach computational thinking through interaction with tangible digital tools for synthetic biology. Inspired in part by Jeannette Wing's (Wing 2008) notion of the essence and pervasiveness of computational thinking, a growing community within SIGCSE is exploring tools that encourage computational thinking that don't use traditional computer science terminology or computer programming (Basawapna 2013, Daily 2014, Freeman 2014, Miller 2014, Wolz 2011). However, that community has not yet explored how to teach computational thinking through bio-design. Synthetic biology is a relatively new research field where scientists engineer living organisms to exhibit new behaviors. Biologists arrange and combine BioBricks, sequences of DNA that exhibit a behavior, sense an environmental factor, or indicate the beginning or end of a larger sequence. Bio-design not only incorporates traditional principles of computational thinking (abstraction, modularity, design/build/test), but also introduces new challenges that force the user to apply these principles in new ways. Interacting with biology can thus 1) help deepen understanding for people who are proficient in computational thinking, 2) provide a platform for introduction to computational thinking for the first time. Because most bio-design is performed in a wetlab by experienced biologists, we focus now on designing and developing low-barrier digital tools for interacting with biology. We present SynFlo (Okerlund 2016), a tangible interactive system for bio-design that mimics a real-life biological wetlab protocol and we discuss the properties of SynFlo and bio-design in general that encourage computational thinking.},

abstract = {As educational jurisdictions around the world begin to integrate computational thinking (CT) into their K-12 mandatory curriculum, there is a need to ensure that classroom activities are engaging, relate to student interests, and effectively promote the development of CT skills. The analysis of sports performance data fulfills this criteria for some students and teachers and presents an exciting context in which students from all K-12 grades can access complex CT concepts. This lightning talk investigates sports analytic tasks within the context of the CT in mathematics and science taxonomy introduced by Weintrop et al. (2015). Specific classroom activities are presented including analyzing the distribution of soccer goals, baseball salaries, the location of successful basketball shots, and the placement of volleyball serves. Examples of data analytics projects will be shared and the four main components of the taxonomy (data practices, modelling and simulation practices, computational problem-solving practices and systems thinking practices) will be identified within each project.},

abstract = {Computational thinking – the ability to solve problems using concepts from computer science – has been widely discussed in the computer science education field. However, the relationship of computational thinking to intelligence – seen as the general ability to understand and solve complex problems – is contestable and has not been extensively explored. The present study addressed the question of how computational thinking is related to intelligence. To find an answer to this question, 71 pre-service teacher students completed a survey with 20 Bebras tasks as a measure of computational thinking and a non-verbal intelligence test (TONI-3) to assess their general problem-solving ability. The large and significant correlation of r(70) = .53, p &lt; .001, indicates that both concepts are highly related. Implications of the findings are discussed, including the meaning of the relationship between computational thinking and intelligence during teaching and assessment, and the possibility of more holistic measures of computational thinking that incorporate procedural aspects.},

abstract = {1There are increasing calls to introduce computational thinking (CT) practices at the K-12 level. These calls are motivated by a consensus that CT practices can be valuable for everyone. This work is based on the assertion that making, or the personal construction of objects employing digital and/or analog technologies, can provide a rich context for enacting CT practices. This paper investigates the activities of a group of beginning youth makers creating an interactive digital/ physical water piano to ask: What forms of CT practices do they enact, and in what ways are these practices further developed in their work? Data includes qualitative ethnographic data including observations, recordings and interviews. We explore the ways youth encounter new, yet relatable and intriguing practices---like debugging to isolate an issue---and appropriate them within particular contexts and for particular goals, often to deal with the immediate challenges they are facing. We end by offering conjectures for ways to support beginning youth makers in appropriating CT practices.},

abstract = {Although educators, researchers, and designers have increasingly advocated for developing computational thinking (CT) in young children, the vast majority of CT learning environments fail to support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and working with others to achieve a goal. To address this issue, our design team developed a music-based puzzle game called SynthSync. The game challenges players to work collaboratively to "debug" jumbled musical compositions through close listening, tinkering, and communication. SynthSync players manipulate controls to adjust musical variables (pitch, note length, and the length of rests) in arhythmic and dissonant musical puzzles based on popular songs until they "discover" the original piece of music.},

abstract = {Many advanced countries are recognizing more and more the importance of teaching computing, in some cases even as early as in primary school. "Computational thinking" is the term often used to denote the conceptual core of computer science or "the way a computer scientist thinks", as Wing put it. Such term - given also the lack of a widely accepted definition - has become a "buzzword" meaning different things to different people. We investigated the Italian primary school teachers' conceptions about computational thinking by analyzing the results of a survey (N=972) conducted in the context of "Programma il Futuro" project. Teachers have been asked to provide a definition of computational thinking and to answer three additional related closed-ended questions. The analysis shows that, while almost half of teachers (43.4%) have included in their definitions some fundamental elements of computational thinking, very few (10.8%) have been able to provide an acceptably complete definition. On a more positive note, the majority is aware that computational thinking is not characterized by coding or by the use of information technology.},

TuneScope combines a sound analysis &amp; synthesis tool with Snap!, a computing language developed at the University of California, Berkeley. This demo explores CT concepts such as decomposition, patterns, abstraction, and algorithms in TuneScope while also exploring the creation of four cascading musical components from (1) sequences of notes, (2) musical chords, (3) sampled sounds, and (4) synthesized sounds. The challenge is to design activities that include authentic music learning as well as genuine computational thinking. In this demo, we show concepts around sequence (the order in which musical notes appear in time; and the order of statements in a computer program) and repetition (includes repeats as well as the structure of melodies; and computing loops and recursion). The instructional activities in this demo have been piloted three times in an associated course at the University of Virginia. Data collected from the course suggest a positive effect on both the understanding of CT concepts and the comprehension of music.

Since January 2014, we have organized more than 180 workshops attended by more than 3.200 students from 35 different schools. With the aim of supporting the methodological and technical changes needed to integrate these new skills in the classroom, 216 teachers also benefited from our training courses, consultancy and support to adapt Trastea.club's activities to their curricula. Initiatives such as Trastea.club aim to support the constant adaptation process faced by schools and teachers due to the rapidly changing technologies and the evolution of students' profiles. The main goal of this initiative is to help schools in their constant adaptation processes towards the new digital literacy1.},

In this note, we present findings from the study. The proposed curricular method acknowledges local differences and presents a way to adapt to those differences through adaptable multiple layers of activities and representational variability. We hope that interested educators and development practitioners would try our method in classrooms.},

abstract = {This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in Ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better "logical thinking") is applicable not only to STEM subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited to decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called "moral machines", using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behaviours under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will have to deal also with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as part of de difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a "right" versus "wrong" answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.},

This project examines how Computational Thinking (CT) skills align to the abilities and interests of young children and can be integrated with other STEM learning activities in order to promote school readiness. The goals of the project are to (1) build a knowledge base on how CT can be promoted in early childhood through integration with mathematics and science, (2) develop learning blueprints to guide the development of integrated classroom and family resources, and (3) develop and evaluate prototype activities to identify design principles useful to future development efforts integrating CT and STEM in early childhood. In this work, a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in CT, early science and mathematics, technology and media, and home and school learning partners with preschool educators and parents to co-design and pilot test prototype activities. Emerging prototypes presented integrate fundamental science and mathematics concepts and practices with CT skills such as problem decomposition, logical and algorithmic thinking, abstraction and debugging. They include hands-on activities with manipulatives familiar to young children and developmentally appropriate technology with unique affordances for complementing and reinforcing the learning that occurs during hands-on experiences. With a goal of addressing CS For All, the co-design, development and pilot testing of prototype activities aim to take into account the needs and strengths of preschool programs and families from low-income and culturally diverse communities.},

abstract = {Pedagogic Conversational Agents are interactive systems that teach by talking to the students. They have been used in several domains to develop competences such as storytelling or negotiation from University to Pre-Primary Education. However, in the literature, no cases of using agents for teaching programming to develop computational thinking in children have been found. In the last decades, there is a growing interest in developing computational thinking in children. According to some authors, if children develop computational thinking, they will be able to solve not only computer problems but their daily life problems in a better way. It is under research which educational technologies and methodologies can be more adequate depending on the context to achieve this goal. In this paper, it is proposed, for the first time, the use of Pedagogic Conversational Agents to develop computational thinking in children. Given the complexity of designing this new type of agent, and as it has been done in previous occasions when trying to design a new agent, the MEDIE methodology will be followed to eventually integrate the agent into the classrooms.},

This technique of teaching uses mistakes as a learning tool to teach computational thinking. Instead of simply showing and explaining correct solutions, code with logical errors is presented to the class. After verifying the code does not work, the class as a whole, becomes engaged in trying to correct the logical errors in code presented to the class. In this paper, we reference the Student Query Directed Learning approach which we map into our techniques. We present a transcript of a lecture one of the authors has given using this technique to illustrate motivations, how to steer the conversation where we want it to go, and student/instructor interactions. Finally, we suggest some "ground rules" to ensure this environment is all-encompassing and one which is conducive to learning.},

abstract = {In recent years, we have seen an increasing interest in bringing programming back to K-12 education. Many educators begin to recognize the necessity of helping children develop computational thinking (CT) as an essential skill to address 21st century challenges. In this poster, we report the preliminary findings from the first year of a 3-year longitudinal study based on a coding curriculum for Grade 4 to Grade 6. This 3-year study aims to gain an understanding of how coding activities helps children at upper primary school ages develop CT for problem solving, and if this problem-solving mindset is transferrable to other contexts, for example, daily life scenario and mathematical field. A part of the research focuses on a comparative study between students' intrinsic motivation of coding (i.e. "plugged") activities and "unplugged" activities (i.e. learning concepts from computer science through paper-based games without programming), which helps us understand the advantages and disadvantages of different learning approaches to CT. At the end of the first year, around 600 fourth graders" were assessed with their CT competence and affective tendency through: (1) a pre/post-test on the CT skill and mathematical ability; (2) a questionnaire on intrinsic motivation in plugged and unplugged activities. The preliminary findings indicate that students have gained a good programming-related knowledge and improved problem-solving skills through our curriculum. They were intrinsically motivated to participated in both types of activities. However, students did not show the ability to transfer computational thinking to mathematical context.},

It is based on an empirical study in which 28 Swedish third-grade school children (9-10 years of age) participated in a creative workshop where they were challenged to design a digital game using stop-motion film technique, working in groups. The study applies a designerly approach to game design activities to investigate what aspects of computational skills can be identified when children employ stop motion filmmaking as a means to envision a digital game design idea and how a designerly approach can enable them to enact dimensions of their computational skills? The data included video observations, casual conversations, and stop-motion videos representing the children's game design ideas. The analysis identified three aspects of computational thinking strategies while children produced stop-motion films: step-by-step procedural skills; design and arrangement skills; and computational perspectives.},

Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the effectiveness of computational thinking in the elementary computer courses. Through such an evaluation, we can obtain the objective data which reflects the teaching effect of elementary computer courses, establish scientific teaching evaluation matrices, and emphasize the importance of those courses. In this paper, we investigate the teaching effectiveness for achieve accurate data and decision support on the computational-thinking-oriented computer curriculum reform. Our research is based on recent evaluations and data acquisition. We analyze the test database, categories of questions, and scores of students. We find several problems, such as the over-emphasizing the programming, incomplete knowledge components, limited background, large deviation of evaluation results among universities. Finally, we give several improvement recommendations.},

To address this challenge, in partnership with the Education Development Center, we have developed a three-year study in which we will work closely with five high-poverty New York City elementary schools that, with the help of an external implementation partner, are trying out distinctly different approaches to integrating CT into elementary instruction, in order to understand how those models work in various contexts, and which models may be particularly effective.Our poster will display the proposed integration model of our first demonstration site as well as the indicators and instruments we are using to understand how this model works.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), a transversal intellectual foundation integral to computer science, is making its way into compulsory comprehensive education worldwide. Students are expected to attain skills and knowledge in such interdisciplinary CT principles as Algorithmic thinking, Data representation, and Debugging. Problem-solving by designing and manipulating interactive media with Scratch, a graphical programming tool, is popular especially at the primary school level. However, there has been confusion regarding how introductory CT can be operationalized for educational practice. Teachers and students need research-based knowledge for setting appropriate learning goals in addition to instruments for formative assessment that potentially improve the quality of learning. This study contributes to these issues by developing the assessment for learning of CT via Scratch in primary school settings. A review on prior studies involving the assessment of CT-related computational ideas in Scratch has led to the conceptualization of a revised assessment framework. Next steps in the study are analyzing fourth grade students' (N=58) Scratch projects and exploring complementary methods for analyzing CT in video recordings of the students' programming processes.},

However, there is still a lack of tools that assist learners and educators in the assessment of these skills. We have implemented an assessment tool, called Dr. Scratch, that analyzes Scratch projects with the aim to assess the level of development of several aspects of computational thinking. One of the issues to address in order to show its validity is to compare the (automatic) evaluations provided by the tool with the (manual) evaluations by (human) experts. In this paper we compare the assessments provided by Dr. Scratch with over 450 evaluations of Scratch projects given by 16 experts in computer science education. Our results show strong correlations between automatic and manual evaluations. As there is an ample debate among educators on the use of this type of tools, we discuss the implications and limitations, and provide recommendations for further research.},

Computational thinking is a fundamental part of decision-making on a large and increasing number of fronts. It is sometimes hard for a computer scientist to imagine how people without access to those tools can navigate the world in an informed way.We have designed a course to bring the social, historical, cultural and technical context of these systems to the attention of students and citizens who would not otherwise have access to them, so they can better understand the world in which they will live and work. The course is a Computer Science course because it is talking about the science of computers, albeit in an approachable form for an audience without any assumed previous programming experience.The course ran in Winter 2014 and Winter 2015 meeting most of its goals, including engaging the non-traditional student who took it.},

One of the intended learning outcomes of the programme is to improve CT practices of teachers, which is one of the three key elements in the CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick. Assessing one's CT practices is challenging because there is no universally agreed-upon assessment method on CT practices in the existing literature. This study adopted the Evidence-centered Assessment Design (ECD) method to design test questions to evaluate teachers' development of CT practices. This study provided two Teacher Development Courses (TDCs) to enable teachers to teach CT through programming. TDC 1 focused on developing CT concepts, practices and perspectives of teachers, while TDC 2 put emphasis on pedagogies of teaching CT. 80 teachers participated in the two courses. The CT practices tests were administered before the courses, between the two courses and after the courses respectively. Results indicated that CT practices were improved progressively when the in-service teachers attended the two courses. It indicated that it is useful for teachers to experience programming practices in their initial learning as well as during their pedagogical development.},

This paper introduces Sphero.Math, a curriculum that integrates CT concepts and practices into 4th-grade mathematics classrooms using the Sphero robot. Sphero.Math was co-designed with school district partners in such a way as to achieve two central design goals. First, integrate CT and mathematics in a mutually-supportive way, meaning that learners engage with CT as a means to deepen mathematics learning and that mathematics serves as a context to learn CT. Second, create a CT-infused curriculum using existing school/district resources that is designed to fit within the constraints of public school classrooms. Along with introducing Sphero.Math and its design goals, this paper presents empirical evidence for the types of CT and math learning opportunities that Sphero.Math can provide for students. In doing so, this work contributes to our understanding of ways to productively integrate CT into elementary classrooms and advances our understanding of how to work within existing educational infrastructure to provide effective and equitable CT learning opportunities for all students.},

abstract = {The way in which the student processes the information, codifies it and recovers it, constitutes its learning approach. The learning process differentiates two qualitative ways of dealing with this process: the deep approach and the superficial approach. The use of each approach depends on the context. However, the adoption of a deep learning approach is positively related to the academic performance. Computational Thinking is defined as a competence of the XXI century, which allows solving problems from a computational point of view, and there is a variety of instruments that allow to measure it, and to know the state in which the evaluated student is. In this paper, we verified the existence of the positive significant relationship between the learning approach and computational thinking in students entering the career of Computer Sciences. By applying Pearson correlation test to verify the relationship between Learning Approaches and Computational Thinking, we found that both variables have homogeneous behaviors and that students show similar conditions. Men are in better conditions than women on the evaluated aspects of the Computational Thinking, Also, we found a significantly positive relationship between Computational Thinking and the Learning Approach (r = 0,882). This result shows that the learning approaches that students' practice are linked to the computational thinking they demonstrate. According to the results, the teachers of this career must develop active and deep methodological strategies due to the predisposition in these students.},

The framework is based on Agile software engineering methods, which rely on a set of principles and practices that can be mapped to the activities of CT. The article presents as well the results of an experiment applying this framework in two sixth-grade classes, with 42 participants in total. The results show that Agile software engineering methods are effective at teaching CT in middle schools, after the addition of some tasks to allow students to explore, project, and experience the potential product before using the software tools at hand. Moreover, according to the teachers’ feedback, the students reached all the educational objectives of the topics involved in the multidisciplinary activities. This result can be taken as an indicator that it is possible to use computing as a medium for teaching other subjects, besides computer science.},

abstract = {Non-major education continues to be a growing area of study in computer science education research. This paper focuses on architects as an audience and the teaching of computer science by architects, who successfully applied computer science education research. The author describes the structure and development of a required computational thinking course with an average yearly enrollment of 69 students and how it applied best practices from Media Computation to improve student outcomes and engagement. A four-year impact study found that a flipped classroom model combined with peer learning methods was superior to traditional lectures and labs for improving student performance and reducing attrition. Comparisons of pre- and post-class surveys revealed an improved perception of computing and an increased interest in the subject -- a positive outcome for a required introductory course. The author also studied the course's long-term effects. Three years after taking the course, a majority of students felt they retained what they learned and that learning computational thinking helped them to learn new software and perform better in advanced computing courses. By taking into account how architects learn and revising in response to assessments, we believe our course structure and teaching methodology demonstrates an effective case for applying computer science education research within an architectural curriculum.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has gained in popularity in recent years, both within educational and political discourses. It is more than ever important to discuss the term itself in order to determine to which extent it is helpful in solving the challenges it has been suggested to address. Recently, Denning (2017) proposed that CT can be viewed as either "traditional" or "new". Traditional CT is a skillset resulting from engaging in traditional computing activities, e.g. programming, whereas new CT forefronts certain skills as desired in problem solving. By looking at CT through the perspective of computer semiotics, specifically the algorithmic sign, it is possible to dissolve the hard distinction of traditional vs. new. Instead, a perception of CT having both an implicit and an explicit nature emerges, allowing for a dialectic relationship between CT's integrated implicit and explicit nature.},

abstract = {In recent years, Computational Thinking (CT) made its way into K-12 as a key set of 21st-century skills. However, the issue of assessing student's learning of CT remains a challenging one: it is indeed not clear how to achieve a comprehensive evaluation that is able to assess not only the technical and domain-specific skills, but also the domain-independent meta-skills of CT. Finding a solution to this issue is crucial, because assessment not only determines whether or not educational goals are being met, but also supports the design of a curriculum. Multiple forms of assessments have been proposed within the main perspective of programming skills, neglecting the possible generalization of CT training on other skills. In this work, we first review the existing approaches to CT assessment. Then, we discuss what non-technical skills (relational skills and cognitive life-skills) should be included in a comprehensive CT assessment framework. Moreover, we provide an indication of possible solutions to capitalize on the existing experiences in order to achieve a feasible integration of different types of assessment.},

abstract = {The recognition of middle grades as a critical juncture in CS education has led to the widespread development of CS curricula and integration efforts. The goal of many of these interventions is to develop a set of underlying abilities that has been termed computational thinking (CT). This goal presents a key challenge for assessing student learning: we must identify assessment items associated with an emergent understanding of key cognitive abilities underlying CT that avoid specialized knowledge of specific programming languages. In this work we explore the psychometric properties of assessment items appropriate for use with middle grades (US grades 6-8; ages 11-13) students. We also investigate whether these items measure a single ability dimension. Finally, we strive to recommend a "lean" set of items that can be completed in a single 50-minute class period and have high face validity. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) adds to the literature related to the emerging construct of CT, and its relationship to the existing CTt and Bebras instruments, and 2) offers a research-based CT assessment instrument for use by both researchers and educators in the field.},

abstract = {Our research group has studied how Kindergarteners through second graders can be introduced to the ideas of Computational Thinking (CT) through engineer design, unplugged, and programming activities. We often found it difficult to explain the boundaries and clear definitions for CT in research, to students and their teachers. Literature provides a variety of definitions from various perspectives, but these definitions often seem like capturing smoke. We see evidence CT, indicating fire, but how hot or lasting it burns cannot be measured by smoke alone. CT is typically defined by siloed concepts and skills. Some silos describe concrete ideas, which tend to be tied to programming principles. Many describe essential ideas, but over generalized becoming hard to teach and measure and distinguish from other types of problem solving. Is there a middle ground where we can clearly observe the presence and growing maturing of CT yet not limit the ways it can manifest, particularly without requiring coding? We hope this poster inspires conversation on 1.) the intersection of CT and programming skills, 2.) the priority and order for learning those skills, and 3.) how we can promote CT in disciplines who interact with and help define computational solutions yet are never expected to learn to program. We hope to share our perspective as well as garner feedback and possibly collaboration on better refining curriculum within Computer Science as well as promoting CT in other disciplines.},

abstract = {End-user game design affords teachers a unique opportunity to integrate computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. However, it is not always apparent in game and simulation projects what computational thinking-related skills students have acquired. Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis (CTPA) enables teachers to visualize which of nine specific skills students have mastered in game design that can then be used to create simulations. CTPA has the potential to automatically recognize and calculate student computational thinking skills, as well as to map students' computational thinking skill progression, as they proceed through the curriculum. The current research furthers knowledge of CTPA by exploring its validity based on how its performance correlates to human grading of student games. Initial data from this validation study indicates that CTPA correlates well with human grading and that it can even be used to predict students' future achievement levels given their current skill progression, making CTPA a potentially invaluable computational thinking evaluation tool for teachers.},

Students needs to be successful in their context and a possible way to achieve this is by developing the computational thinking. In the last few years there are several initiatives to promote computational thinking and to define approaches and methods to support it. One of this is the unplugged methods, in which students develop computational thinking skills without using the technology. This paper presents an experiment to promote computational thinking by using unplugged methods and employing robots as teachers as an engagement factor for the students. During the experiment, they have been distributed in two groups. One has carried out unplugged activities to develop computational thinking while the other did not. From the experiment, it is possible to see that results are better for those students that have completed unplugged activities and there are differences depending on age.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a multi-semester study of the impact on student perceptions of their computational thinking abilities as a result of collaboration between students in computer science (CS) and journalism courses to solve a problem for a community partner, Habitat for Humanity. Interdisciplinary computing collaborations have become a popular mode of instruction in upper-level CS courses. In many cases, these collaborations have been with other STEM disciplines. However, there are non-STEM fields that have been transformed by computer science and can also serve as fruitful test beds for curricular innovation; journalism is one such field. In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need. The study investigates whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students. 41 CS students participated in the study alongside 96 students in a range of other STEM and non-STEM majors. Quantitative data were collected to gauge students' attainment of concepts and skills constitutive to computational thinking. Pre-test data indicate that CS students were no different from other STEM students in their own assessment of computational thinking and skills. Post-test data indicate that while all students made significant gains in self-assessment of skills and knowledge, CS majors fared significantly better than their peers. It is particularly noteworthy that CS majors' gains outpaced those of computer engineering majors. Further research is planned to gain additional insight into the possible reasons behind these results.},

Keeko robot can carry out voice interaction, screen interaction, programming board interaction, and help children learn to code. This paper conducted semi-structured interviews and observed the demonstration courses with Keeko robot development team, designed the questionnaire based on the theoretical foundation of Positive Technological Development)PTD(, carried out an online survey on 103 preschool teachers who had used Keeko as a teaching tool of computational thinking, and a total of 89 participants completed the questionnaire. Single-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistics was used to analyze the questionnaire data, and obtain preliminary views on using Keeko robot to motivate children's positive behaviors. The results showed that the median of the six constructs in the questionnaire is greater than 4 (4 represents uncertain attitude and neutral attitude), which meant that they have a positive attitude towards using Keeko robot to carry out the computational thinking education. The research result helps people understand the attitude of preschool teachers and provides a valuable reference for the development and design of related robots in the future. In the meanwhile, it also helps preschool teachers to improve their understanding of robots, curriculum content, teaching process and children's behavior, so as to effectively carry out the computational thinking education on preschoolers.},

abstract = {Computational thinking, as coined by Jeannette Wing, is a fundamental skill for all to be able to live in today's world, a mode of thought that goes well beyond computing and provides a framework for reasoning about problems and methods of their solution. It has a long tradition as algorithmic thinking which within computer science is a competence to formulate a solution of a problem in the form of an algorithm and then to implement the algorithm as a computer program. Computational thinking is not an adequate characterization of computer science as claimed by Peter Denning and he is right -- it is a collection of key mental tools and practices originated in computing but addressed to all areas far beyond computer science. As an extension of algorithmic thinking, it includes thinking with many levels of abstraction as a problem solving approach inherently connected to computer science and addressed to all students to use computers and computing skills in solving problems in various school subjects coming from various scientific and applied areas. Computational thinking involves concepts, skills and competences that lie at the heart of computing, such as abstraction, decomposition, generalization, approximation, heuristics, algorithm design, efficiency and complexity issues and therefore it is clear that basic computer science knowledge helps to systematically, correctly, and efficiently process information, perform tasks, and solve problems. Although coming from computer science, computational thinking is not only the study of computer science, though computers play an essential role in the design of problems' solutions. It is a very important and useful mode of thinking in almost all disciplines and school subjects as an insight into what can and cannot be computed.In this talk we shall discuss a new computing curriculum addressed to ALL students in K-12 in Poland which motivates them to use computational thinking in solving problems in various school subjects. Moreover its goal is to encourage and prepare students from early school years to consider computing and related fields as disciplines of their future study and professional career. To this end, the curriculum allows teachers and schools to personalize learning and teaching according to students' interests, abilities, and needs.The new computing curriculum benefits a lot from our experience in teaching informatics in our schools for almost 30 years -- the first curriculum was approved by the ministry of education in 1985, 20 years after the first regular classes on informatics were held in two high schools in Wroc\l{}aw and in Warsaw. Today, informatics is an obligatory subject in middle school (grades 7-9) and high school (grades 10-12) and it will replace computer lessons (mainly on ICT) in elementary schools (grades 1-6). The new curriculum is also addressed to vocational education.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of "Big Data" is creating a need for research perspectives that blend computational thinking (with its focus on, e.g., abstractions, algorithms and scalability) with inferential thinking (with its focus on, e.g., underlying populations, sampling patterns, error bars and predictions). Database researchers and statistical machine learning researchers are centrally involved in the creation of this blend, and research that incorporates perspectives from both databases and machine learning will be of particular value in the bigger picture. This is true both for methodology and for theory. I present highlights of several research initiatives that draw jointly on database and statistical foundations, including work on concurrency control and distributed inference, subsampling, time/data tradeoffs and inference/privacy tradeoffs.},

We describe the creation of our lesson plans, how we worked with experienced and pre-service teachers alike to deliver the lessons, and how we assessed the effectiveness of each intervention. We will discuss our successes and failures, and provide information on our future plans to incorporate more formalized education theory, pedagogy, and research methodology in future years to further this project. Based on our assessment results, we observed statistically significant gains in student self-efficacy with creating computer programs that perform a variety of operations. In addition, students reported a significantly higher understanding of how computer programming can be used in daily life. Our survey also highlighted differences in student self-efficacy between the two interventions, and we discuss possible sources for that result. We discuss observed results based on student groups with various backgrounds, previous STEM experiences, and socioeconomic status.},

abstract = {The participation of girls and women is fundamental in solving problems that the society demands. Currently, the figures indicate a deficit of female presence in the STEM context, which implies the loss of the talent of the female collective. The school, as the transforming axis of society, must generate actions that motivate, involve and generate commitment in girls and women, enhancing their engagement in the STEM context. This paper shows two unplugged activities taken from a serial of activities implemented with elementary students and families in a digital cultural center in Madrid-Spain. The implementation is based on general objectives such as 1. To introduce and motivate interest since an early age in computer programming, 2. To develop gender dynamics that educate on gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in the STEM area. Performing the example in the roles of female gender in science, as well as transforming stereotypes with the purpose of motivate girls and adult women, without excluding the male group. The activities also seek to train Computational Thinking skills, to introduce basic computer programming concepts as well as showing that unplugged activities are important in teaching computer programming, and integrate women into the STEM area, as an important tool to reduce gender gaps. Based on our informal observations, some results were: involvement of the female collective in the construction of codes, improvement in the dynamics of gender equity in each activity and that the girls created more complex codes than males.},

Are all uses of computational technology in education helpful, and if not, how does one separate the benefits from the burdens? We will explore how computing enables multiple representations in the sciences, arts, and humanities, giving us the opportunity to be more fully human as we seek new knowledge in service to society. Moving "beyond PowerPointless-ness," we have the opportunity to demonstrate that computing really matters in teaching and learning. Computing "matters" because quantitative reasoning, computational thinking, and multi-scale modeling are the intellectual "heart and soul" of 21st Century science and therefore are the essential skills of the 21st Century workforce. Computing "matters" because we can apply the power of dynamic, visual, and interactive computing to reach a deeper understanding of models across math and science while exploring their role in understanding our world.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) involves a broadly applicable and complex set of processes that are often explained by way of the knowledge, attitudes, and general practices that they entail. However, to become facile with CT, learners require instruction that is grounded in concrete, relevant experiences. This paper examines teacher practices that are intended to promote CT skill acquisition through instruction that takes place in two framing contexts. The phenomenological context, which is based on observable patterns of object interaction that recur in games and simulations, is particularly valuable for developing the capacity to think abstractly. Abstraction is the key to recognizing analogous conditions, an ability that is the basis for transferring learning to new situations. The disciplinary context describes areas of application within and across subject areas, including computer science, that can foster proficiency with data representation, problem decomposition, and other CT skills. Using the Scalable Game Design curriculum as a lens to examine classroom practices, we find that teachers both plan and enact CT instruction in these contexts.},

abstract = {Across the world there has been a paradigm shift in school education, as many countries are incorporating Computer Science (CS), programming, and Computational Thinking (CT), into their K-12 curriculums for the first time. In 2018 these subjects will be introduced to the New Zealand (NZ) Digital Technologies curriculum under the subject of "Computational Thinking". Like the majority of countries who have introduced these topics, NZ faces challenges in preparing teachers, and in successfully implementing a curriculum which achieves its educational goals. To support this curriculum, we have been conducting studies in primary schools across NZ, trialing resources with teachers and students. Building on a 2014 exploratory study on CS and programming in intermediate school, this project investigates the existing assumptions around CT education in K-12. It aims to address the specific questions: How do we teach CT concepts and approaches to primary aged students? If they learn CT, does it have the expected positive impacts on students learning? And, what other positive and negative impacts does this have?Throughout 2015 and 2016 a study was conducted with 18 primary school teachers from across NZ, who used CS Unplugged and educational programming languages in their classrooms. Teachers submitted feedback on these classes through an online form, and participated in semi-structured interviews. The feedback responses and interview transcripts were analysed using a thematic approach, which revealed many positive impacts on students general learning, minimal negative impacts, and observations of CT development.},

abstract = {The term computational thinking has received some discussion in the field of computer science education research. The term is defined as the concept of thinking about problems in a way that can be implemented in a computing device. Of course, after having thought about a problem using computational thinking skills, the next step should be to use programming skills to implement the solution. This work in progress is exploring ways in which programming can be employed as a tool to teach computational thinking and problem solving. Data is collected from teachers, academics, and professionals from various industries. They are purposively selected because of their knowledge of or interest in the topics of problem solving, computational thinking, and the teaching of programming. This data is analyzed within the paradigm of the grounded theory approach. The results of an initial analysis imply an ordering of complexity associated with computational thinking skills, imply connections between computational thinking skills and programming activities, and imply a relationship between computational thinking skills and other taxonomies of learning.},

abstract = {Computing education is becoming increasingly important in high schools. Computational modelling is important in computing and many sciences, but there is a lack of research on how teachers should teach computational modelling in high schools. This study was a design-based research study with 86 teachers teaching 12 different subjects at 44 Danish high schools. The study aimed to develop a template to help design and classify didactical questions on computational modelling. Teachers participated in one of two courses on computational modelling. The intervention group (Prog+) included an introduction to agent-based modelling and programming in NetLogo. The comparison group (Prog-) included a general introduction to agent-based modelling. A template consisting of 16 modelling parameters was developed with teachers. Results showed that the template was helpful for teachers to design didactical questions and for the research team to classify the taxonomical levels of these questions. A total of 51 teaching activities were developed by teachers and didactical questions were derived. The strength of this design based research study was that it included a control group and inspired teachers to design and evaluate didactical questions in computational modelling in a wide range of high school subjects. Future studies are needed to evaluate the validity of the template.},

abstract = {This study is aimed to teach autistic children to learn social reciprocity and emotional expression through social stories, and build a social story teaching aid system with the aid of sequential computational thinking as learning strategy as well as Chibitronics and Makey Makey. This system can make autistic children to learn situational content from social stories, understand the social stories through computational thinking and arrange corresponding sequential structure. In this study, we recruited three 9 year-old autistic children, carried out teaching experiments four times and observed their behavior for story plot. It showed that technical teaching aid can improve autistic children's learning motivation and interests and provide them with contextual cue of social situation, helping build their social recognition and social reciprocity into social situation and their social reciprocity skills. I believe that autistic children can improve their social reciprocity and emotional expression skills with the help of sequential computational thinking and social teaching aid system designed with Chibitronics and Makey Makey.},

To overcome these difficulties, I introduce a new project: CORGIS - a "Collection of Real-time, Giant, Interesting, Situated Datasets". The CORGIS project comprises a collection of libraries that provide an interface to big data for students, architectures for rapidly enabling new datasets, and a web-based textbook platform for disseminating relevant course materials. This textbook features an online block-based programming environment, real-time collaborative text editing, and continuous server-side storage.

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), which encompasses strategies for problem analysis and solution design, is highly applicable in all STEM disciplines, including computer science, for learning concepts as well as solving problems. Yet, the exposure of K-12 students to CT in many schools is practically non-existent. For students to acquire this important skill, teachers require in-depth knowledge of the problem solving strategies that define CT, and strategies for integrating CT into their lesson plans. The proposed special session will be both a tutorial on CT and an interactive session for sharing the experience and results from a CT workshop held at Columbus State University for middle and high school STEM subject teachers. This workshop, offered as a part of the ACT4STEM (Applying Computational Thinking for STEM Disciplines) project, took place in the summer of 2015. It brought together teachers from the metropolitan Columbus area in Georgia with priority given to teachers from high-need schools (as determined by the GA Department of Education [1]). The workshop introduced the participants to CT concepts and demonstrated how CT strategies of pattern recognition, generalization, problem decomposition and algorithmic thinking can be used to improve student learning of STEM concepts. The proposed special session will present sample CT modules developed for the ACT4STEM workshop in the form of a tutorial and projects and lesson plans designed by participants during the workshop. It will include interactive, hands-on activities and discussions in addition to results from the teachers' actual experiences on applying these lesson plans in their classes. This special session will benefit K12 teachers of STEM subjects interested in improving their students' comprehension of discipline related concepts and their application. Moreover, computer science faculty interested in helping K-12 teachers by organizing training sessions will gain valuable insights from the first-hand accounts of the presenters of their own experience with such an effort.},

The preliminary multi-methods assessment shows that the course engendered high levels of motivation, achieved key objectives for learning in and across contexts, largely affirmed the choice of languages/tools, and supported, though less strongly than anticipated, the motivational effects of real-world data},

In an increasingly information-based society, CT is becoming an essential skill for everyone. To ensure that students develop this ability at the K-12 level, it is important to provide teachers with an adequate knowledge about CT and how to incorporate it into their teaching.

Results demonstrate that introducing computational thinking into education courses can effectively influence preservice teachers’ understanding of CT concepts.},

This should make everyday life easier and shorten the time needed to solve these problems. Before someone can become an IT specialist, or at least begin to think as one, they must start building their knowledge. One of the best ways to start can be their own inner motivation or an impulse from their school environment. The goal of this paper is to select appropriate channels for sharing YouTube videos on the server and to describe how they can participate in supporting the development of computational thinking. This article introduces freely available YouTube channels that can be used as a form of e-learning as well as an inspiration for computer science.},

Due to COVID-19, 151 teachers attended the Summer 2020 PD workshops in a week-long virtual conference format. In this paper, we describe Virtual Pivot: Infusing Computing, which employed emerging technology tools, pre-PD training, synchronous and asynchronous sessions, Snap! pair programming, live support, and live networking. Drawing on findings from participant interviews and post-PD surveys, we argue that three categories of changes (digital tools, formats, and supports for teacher engagement and collaboration) were effective in increasing participants' self-efficacy in teaching CT, supporting collaboration, and enabling participants to design CT-infused content-area lessons. We conclude by discussing how elements of this virtual PD can be replicated to increase teacher and student access to CT practices in middle and high school classrooms},

abstract = {Game design activities support young people to acquire Computational Thinking (CT) skills in an entertaining way. While the importance of CT is increasing, we still lack empirical data on how cognitive functions support learning to program. The current study is a step towards bridging this gap. We tested 48 participants aged 10-15 during summer courses to see how programming skills are associated with cognitive processes. Descriptive statistics of gaming and design elements of the participants' final projects were correlated with measures of working memory, creativity, and arithmetic. Results show that different concepts of CT applied in games were associated with separate cognitive measures. The number of design elements (shape and structure of the game, sound, visual design) correlated with both working memory and arithmetic skills; the number of game elements (interactivity, mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics) correlated with creativity; whereas the complexity of the project was only predicted by age. The overall evaluation of the project was associated with age and arithmetic skills. Since the different concepts of CT were predicted by different cognitive skills, the current study provides empirical evidence that CT is not a single homogenous skill, but a set of subskills, with each part loading on different cognitive functions.},

abstract = {End-user game design tools are effective in motivating and exposing students with no prior programming experience to computer science. However, while there is good evidence that these environments are effective motivators, the question remains what do students actually learn? For our purposes, using AgentSheets, we would like to know if students can apply the knowledge obtained from programming games to creating science simulations. Specifically, we want to better understand if students are able to recognize Computational Thinking Patterns (CTP) from their game programming experience. Computational Thinking Patterns are abstract programming patterns that enable agent interactions not only in games but also in science simulations. Students and teachers who participated in a game design summer institute were administered a Computational Thinking Pattern Quiz (CTP Quiz). This quiz tested the participants' ability to recognize and understand patterns in a context removed from game programming. We found that participants, for the most part, were able to understand and recognize the patterns in a variety of contexts},

To demonstrate its efficacy, this rubric was used to evaluate and compare student work from the CS and non-CS student cohorts in a mixed-major app design undergraduate course. Our analysis showed some significant differences between the cohorts, which were expected, as well as more subtle differences. The rubric demonstrated that it was sensitive to significant and subtle variations of MCT. The instrument is available for download and use.},

abstract = {Theorists and advocates of “remixing” have suggested that appropriation can act as a pathway for learning. We test this theory quantitatively using data from more than 2.4 million multimedia programming projects shared by more than 1 million users in the Scratch online community. First, we show that users who remix more often have larger repertoires of programming commands even after controlling for the numbers of projects and amount of code shared. Second, we show that exposure to computational thinking concepts through remixing is associated with increased likelihood of using those concepts. Our results support theories that young people learn through remixing, and have important implications for designers of social computing systems.},

abstract = {Globally, there is a growing interest in preparing students to develop fluency with computing. The K-12 Computer Science Framework states that by the end of 12th grade, students should be able to create computational artifacts through continuous testing and refining of their products considering unique perspectives of peers. It has been suggested that creative project experiences with iteration based on feedback encourage the development of these computational skills. However, traditional classrooms are more focused on getting the correct answer to standardized questions. Countries such as Mongolia may have particular challenges in offering students opportunities to develop projects, due to pressure from standardized exams for college entry and lack of teachers prepared to lead computational project-based learning (Uyanga, 2006). This is an exploratory study of an 8-session/16-hour intervention course that provided 13 high-school students in Mongolia an opportunity to create, share, and iterate on computational projects. Measurements included assessment of student attitudes and evaluated how they viewed their participation and learning in the course through pre- and post-surveys, analyzing their responses with qualitative coding. Results suggest that the opportunity to create projects was novel for these students; attitudes regarding feedback changed, and iteration was viewed as key in creating computational artifacts. The analysis also highlights the urgency of further research on localizing the K-12 Computer Science Framework throughout different countries to foster these skills and developing structures that allow students to embrace the freedom of project-based learning.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing attention to infusing CT into middle and high school content area classrooms, there is a lack of information about the most effective practices and models to support teachers in their efforts to integrate disciplinary content and CT principles. To address this need, this paper proposes the Code, Connect and Create (3C) professional development (PD) model, which was designed to support middle and high school content area teachers in infusing computational thinking into their classrooms. To evaluate the model, we analyzed quantitative and qualitative data collected from Infusing Computing PD workshops designed for in-service science, math, English language arts, and social studies teachers located in two Southeastern states. Drawing on findings from our analysis of teacher-created learning segments, surveys, and interviews, we argue that the 3C professional development model supported shifts in teacher understandings of the role of computational thinking in content area classrooms, as well as their self-efficacy and beliefs regarding CT integration into disciplinary content. We conclude by offering implications for the use of this model to increase teacher and student access to computational thinking practices in middle and high school classrooms.},

abstract = {The ability to select or customize characters in educational applications and games has been shown to influence factors related to learning effects such as transfer, self-efficacy, and motivation. Most previous conclusions on the perception of virtual characters and the effect of character assignment in interactive applications have been reached through short, one-task experiments. To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks. In VEnvI, students create performances for virtual characters by assembling blocks. With a between-subjects design, in which some of the students can alter their character and others are not given that possibility, we examine the influence of the presence or absence of character choice options on learning.We hypothesize that students have higher learning outcomes when they can choose and customize how their character looks compared to when they are assigned a character. We confirm this hypothesis for a category of learning (Remember and Understand) and give insights on students' relationships with their character.},

Although there has been much focus on this field in recent years, it is rarely taught as a formal course within the curriculum, and there is little consensus on what exactly computational thinking entails and how to teach and evaluate it. To address these concerns, we have developed a computational thinking framework to be used as a planning and evaluative tool. Within this framework, we aim to unify the differing opinions about what computational thinking should involve. As a case study, we have applied the framework to Light-Bot, an educational game with a strong focus on programming, and found that the framework provides us with insight into the usefulness of the game to reinforce computer science concepts.},

This paper focuses on how concurrency is dealt with by five well-known tools in this domain: Scratch, Alice, AgentSheets, NetLogo and Greenfoot. We present the results of a systematic analysis contrasting their model of concurrent behavior with the corresponding programming interface messages that trigger their users' interpretation and learning of concurrency-related concepts. We present and discuss the conceptualizations that potentially emerge from using these five tools and compare them with established concurrency concepts. Our findings indicate opportunities for an explicit exploration of how some concurrency aspects are implemented in games and simulations built with CT tools. We believe that this might facilitate future learning and comprehension of complex concurrency concepts, considering that the knowledge embedded in these tools can also influence students' understanding of concurrency.},

Curricula and environments are being developed for different group ages, from kindergarten to university, in several countries. As part of this global tendency, France has recently taken political decisions to integrate CT Education (CTE) in the mandatory national curriculum. However, many challenges remain until a full implementation is achieved. In this paper we report on a partnership between a university, local elementary schools and the county Ministry of Education (MoE), and on an exploratory project of introducing CT to K-5 students. This project has provided us with valuable feedback on the specifics of integrating CT in a national curriculum and the creation of a partnership and a community. These lessons will be used in the following stage of scaling up to more elementary schools in the entire county, but also addressing other school levels such as kindergarten, middle school and high school.},

We explored how to discern the occurrences of CT in the projects of 12th grade high school students in the computer science (CS) course. Within the projects, they constructed models and ran simulations of phenomena from other (STEM) disciplines. We examined which CT aspects occurred in students' activities and how to assess students' CT accomplishments. For this purpose we employed a framework based on CT characterizations by Wing [14, 15], CSTA [4] and Comer et al. [3]. We analyzed students' project documentation, survey results and interviews with individual students. The findings indicate that this framework is suitable for detection of occurrences of CT aspects in students' data. Moreover, our preliminary results suggest that the framework is useful in assessment of the quality of the students' CT performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the first phase of a cross-disciplinary project between computing and English faculty who explored how computational thinking skills such as abstraction, modeling, and iteration can be used to support English faculty in teaching students to write well. This initial phase of collaboration focused on developing and applying a model to capture fundamental concepts for teaching composition with special emphasis on those related to clarity. We iteratively developed a complex concept map that can act as a curriculum planning and teaching tool. In the next phase of the project, we plan to adapt selected exercises from traditional writing courses to include computational approaches such as modeling, and to test which audiences benefit from these revised exercises.},

abstract = {The outcome of a multidisciplinary and iterative process, CyberPLAYce is a tangible, interactive, cyber-physical learning tool for children supporting computational thinking and, particularly, playful storytelling. CyberPLAYce finds inspiration in the concept of child-computer interaction, where meaning is constructed through spatially reconfiguring the physical environment. The novel aspect of CyberPLAYce is its extension of cyber-learning to the dimension of space where children construct meaning at a larger physical scale. This paper outlines the motivations for CyberPLAYce, focuses on the full arc of design and evaluation activities concerning computational thinking (CT) practices that engaged 8-12-year-old storytellers, and concludes with a consideration of future work focusing on spatial thinking with CyberPLAYce. Results from our empirical study suggest that cyber-physical play afforded by CyberPLAYce scaffolds computational thinking, creating, and sharing in children. Particularly for IDC researchers in the educational domain, CyberPLAYce represents a Research-through-design exemplar supporting children's enjoyment of learning and meaning-construction.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has been widely introduced and investigated in recent years, particularly in the U.S. since the born of visual, block-based, drag-drop programming environments such as Kodu, Scratch, Minecraft and App Inventor. Although the user interface is mainly in English, the characteristics of these easy-to-use, game-based, and interactive tools attract many teachers and researchers in the world to pay much attention to the possibilities and opportunities of introducing these tools to students. Recently, some primary school teachers in Hong Kong begin to independently introduce some of these programming tools to students at age 7 - 11 as a part of learning activities in their computer lessons. Their motives are similar but not the same, such as making a fun learning and teaching experience, motivating students for active and collaborative participation, and introducing CT concepts to develop generic skills (e.g. problem solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking). However, there is an absence of well-developed and planned curriculum for "coding education" to introduce computational thinking systematically to students in the local context with expected learning outcomes. Due to the uniqueness of K-12 curriculum in Hong Kong, the existing curriculum model in the U.S. may need to be customized and redesigned to become suitable for integrating into the curriculum in Hong Kong. In this poster, it describes the first proposed coding education curriculum in Hong Kong primary education (Primary 4 to Primary 6) with relevant objectives, structures, contents, and learning outcomes. A new pedagogical design framework for CT is introduced in this poster, which could be generalizable and yet to be evaluated. This new curriculum will serve as the curriculum guide to local teachers, and is the first research initiative of a three-year longitudinal study investigating the impact of CT activities to students particularly in Hong Kong. The experience of this curriculum development for CT concepts in K-12 education can inspire teachers and researchers in other parts of the world when adopting and internationalizing CT activities based on the curriculum model developed under the U.S. education.},

In this study, we present the phases of construction of a learning trajectory (LT) for Decomposition in the context of CS/CT in K-8 education. From an extensive literature review, 63 learning goals representative of decomposition understanding and practices were identified and synthesized into 13 consensus goals. The focus of this paper is how relationships between these consensus goals were identified and used to place the goals into a learning trajectory. We discuss the theories and frameworks that guided the trajectory's construction as well as the methodology and justifications used to draw pathways through the trajectory in each phase. Finally, we discuss potential uses for the trajectory and suggest further explorations for decomposition in CS/CT.},

The development of CT teaching materials and approaches is therefore of prime importance. Here, an online learning platform for CT, named Co-De, is presented. It addresses five major aspects of CT explicitly, in the context of a variety of computational problems. Students using Co-De, work through classes, individually or in teams, doing a mixture of unplugged and online exercises and quizzes, as well as some programming. Teachers can fine-tune the default Co-De learning paths to cater for their specific groups of students and/or specific learning goals. Co-De is implemented on top of the open-source learning platform Moodle. It can be used directly at a central server, or a customised version can be installed and used locally.},

For these guidelines to be useful in CS education, a critical next step is to translate the guidelines to explicit learning targets and design aligned instructional tools and assessments. Our research and development goal in this paper is to design a playful, curriculum-neutral assessment aligned with the 'Data and Analysis' concept (grades 6-8) from the CS framework. Using Evidence Centered Design and Participatory Design, we present a set of assessment guidelines for assessing data and analysis, as well as a set of design considerations for integrating data and analysis across middle school curricula in CS and non-CS contexts. We outline these contributions, describe how they were applied to the development of a game-based formative assessment for data and analysis, and present preliminary findings on student understanding and challenges inferred from student gameplay.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is being infused into curricula in a variety of core K-12 STEM courses. As these topics are being introduced to students without prior programming experience and are potentially taught by instructors unfamiliar with programming and CT, appropriate lesson design might help support both students and teachers. "Use-Modify-Create" (UMC), a CT lesson progression, has students ease into CT topics by first "Using" a given artifact, "Modifying" an existing one, and then eventually "Creating" new ones. While studies have presented lessons adopting and adapting this progression and advocating for its use, few have focused on evaluating UMC's pedagogical effectiveness and claims. We present a comparison study between two CT lesson progressions for middle school science classes. Students participated in a 4-day activity focused on developing an agent-based simulation in a block-based programming environment. While some classrooms had students develop code on days 2-4, others used a scaffolded lesson plan modeled after the UMC framework. Through analyzing student's exit tickets, classroom observations, and teacher interviews, we illustrate differences in perception of assignment difficulty from both the students and teachers, as well as student perception of artifact "ownership" between conditions.},

However, teachers' readiness for programming-based activities along with their concerns about taking away time from key subject content present barriers for broader integration of computational thinking. This paper presents our experience and findings of a yearlong professional development for a cohort of 21 teachers from self-contained classrooms in grades 4 - 6. The project targeted these grade levels for two reasons: (1) self-contained classrooms provide maximum contact time between teachers and students, affording more flexibility in scheduling and potential for sustained impact, and (2) these grades are critical times for students to build interest and foundations in STEM while many teachers in these classrooms have limited STEM and computing background. The paper provides an overview of the professional development and describes selected activities in more detail. The impact of the professional development on the participating teachers is also presented.},

abstract = {This paper explores the integration of coding, CT and literacy by describing a study conducted with first and second grade classrooms in Norfolk, Virginia. A total of 667 students and 57 educators from eight elementary schools, as well as 181 students from two comparison schools participated in a curriculum called Coding as Another Language (CAL) that utilizes KIBO robotics, a developmentally appropriate kit which does not require keyboards or screens. CAL positions the teaching of programming as a symbolic system of representation, a tool for creative expression and communication. Thus, research questions regarding the relationship between students' coding and CT outcomes and their literacy skills were explored, as well as teachers' reactions to the experience, in particular regarding the integrating of teaching computer science and literacy in the early grades. Participation in the CAL-KIBO curriculum was associated with improvement in coding and unplugged CT skills. Baseline literacy skills were related to students' acquisition of CT skills. For example, students who had higher literacy scores at the beginning of the term were more successful in CT tasks. Furthermore, although teachers varied in their perceptions of integrating coding and CT with literacy, our findings suggest that these disciplines may share some cognitive and pedagogical overlap that has yet to be extensively explored in the early computing education field.},

abstract = {In this report we consider the current status of the coverage of computer science in education at the lowest levels of education in multiple countries. Our focus is on computational thinking (CT), a term meant to encompass a set of concepts and thought processes that aid in formulating problems and their solutions in different fields in a way that could involve computers [130].The main goal of this report is to help teachers, those involved in teacher education, and decision makers to make informed decisions about how and when CT can be included in their local institutions. We begin by defining CT and then discuss the current state of CT in K-9 education in multiple countries in Europe as well as the United States. Since many students are exposed to CT outside of school, we also discuss the current state of informal educational initiatives in the same set of countries.An important contribution of the report is a survey distributed to K-9 teachers, aiming at revealing to what extent different aspects of CT are already part of teachers' classroom practice and how this is done. The survey data suggest that some teachers are already involved in activities that have strong potential for introducing some aspects of CT. In addition to the examples given by teachers participating in the survey, we present some additional sample activities and lesson plans for working with aspects of CT in different subjects. We also discuss ways in which teacher training can be coordinated as well as the issue of repositories. We conclude with future directions for research in CT at school.},

abstract = {My vision for the 21st Century: Computational thinking will be a fundamental skill used by everyone in the world. Just as reading, writing, and arithmetic are fundamental skills every child learns, computational thinking is a skill needed for every citizen to function in today's global society. Computational thinking is an approach to solving problems, building systems, and understanding human behavior that draws on the power and limits of computing. Computational thinking is the use of abstraction to tackle complexity and the use of automation to tackle scale. The combination of the automation of abstraction underlies the enormous capability and reach of computing. In this talk I will argue that computational thinking has already begun to influence many disciplines, from the sciences to the humanities, but that the best is yet to come. Looking to the future, we can anticipate even more profound impact of computational thinking on science, technology, and society: on the ways new discoveries will be made, innovation will occur, and cultures will evolve.Teaching computational thinking also raises new challenges for education, especially in early grades. While we have models for teaching children mathematics and physics, we do not yet have such models for teaching computational thinking. Moreover, we have the unique opportunity to make most effective use of the computer as a tool to enhance the learning of computational thinking.In this talk, I will give examples of computational thinking, including ones from our daily lives. It is exciting to imagine the day when computational thinking will be commonplace.},

abstract = {One way to increase access to education on computing is to integrate computational thinking (CT) into K12 disciplinary courses. However, this challenges teachers to both learn CT and decide how to best integrate CT into their classes. In this position paper, we present PRADA, an acronym for Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Decomposition, and Algorithms, as a practical and understandable way of introducing the core ideas of CT to non-computing teachers. We piloted the PRADA model in two, separate, week-long professional development workshops designed for in-service middle and high school teachers and found that the PRADA model supported teachers in making connections between CT and their current course material. Initial findings, which emerged from the analysis of teacher-created learning materials, survey responses, and focus group interviews, indicate that the PRADA model supported core content teachers in successfully infusing CT into their existing curricula and increased their self-efficacy in CT integration.},

abstract = {Are fine arts and technology compatible partners" Do these disciplines support each other or flinch when they are combined like oil and water" Do collaborative efforts provide interesting insights and opportunities for students" For practitioners" There seems to be an explosion of interest in exploring arts and technology connections: new media, digital media, kinetic art, new frontiers, emergent media, interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary are only some of the terms used to describe this fusion of disciplines.A visit to the SIGGRAPH art gallery or the SIGCHI Interactivity sessions, for example, will showcase a wide variety of uses of computing, embedded control, sensors, and actuators in the service of art. Kinetic art using embedded control is a marriage of art and technology. Artistic sensibility and creativity are required for concept and planning, and computer science and engineering skills are required to realize the artistic vision. However, these different skills are often taught in extremely different parts of a university campus.In this talk I will start with some thoughts on the nature of combining arts and technology, and show some historical and contemporary examples specifically relating to kinetic art. I will then describe an ongoing collaborative course that involves Computer Science and Art students working together to design and create computer-controlled kinetic art. Students in the course explore interfacing of embedded computer systems with sensors and actuators of all sorts. They also explore physical and conceptual aspects of machine-making as a fine-art sculpture process. Our goal is to enhance the educational experience of both groups of students. We believe that both student groups gain significant and unusual benefits that they can apply in a variety of ways in their respective disciplines.},

Czech Republic, along with numerous European countries, currently implements a revision of the existing computer science curriculum at the primary and secondary education level, to widen the national information literacy and embed the development of CT into the basic STEM education. The integration of the CT development at a level of a national school education raises a question of assessing actual CT skills of the students and creating a standardized methodology for a such assessment. This paper discusses the results of the research aimed to assess the CT skills within primary school students which was tested on a sample number of 90 students age 8 - 13 during extended education classes and events.},

abstract = {The rapid growth in the size and scope of datasets in science and technology has created a need for novel foundational perspectives on data analysis that blend the inferential and computational sciences. That classical perspectives from these fields are not adequate to address emerging problems in "Big Data" is apparent from their sharply divergent nature at an elementary level-in computer science, the growth of the number of data points is a source of "complexity" that must be tamed via algorithms or hardware, whereas in statistics, the growth of the number of data points is a source of "simplicity" in that inferences are generally stronger and asymptotic results can be invoked. On a formal level, the gap is made evident by the lack of a role for computational concepts such as "runtime" in core statistical theory and the lack of a role for statistical concepts such as "risk" in core computational theory. I present several research vignettes aimed at bridging computation and statistics, including the problem of inference under privacy and communication constraints, and ways to exploit parallelism so as to trade off the speed and accuracy of inference.},

To this end, we have designed and administered a test for computational thinking ability, and contrasted the results of this test with the class marks for the students involved. The results of this test give us an initial view of the abilities that students possess when entering the computer science course. The results indicate that students who performed well in the assessment have a favourable pass rate for their class tests, and specific areas of weakness have been identified. Finally, we describe the plan for a follow-up test to take place at the end of the course to determine how students' abilities have changed over a semester of studies.},

abstract = {When middle school students encounter computer models of science phenomenon in science class, how do they think those computer models work? Computer models operationalize real-world behaviors of selected variables, and can simulate interactions between the modeled elements through programmed instructions. This study explores how middle school students think about the high-level semantic meaning of those instructions, which we term rules. To investigate this aspect of students’ computational thinking, we developed the Computational Modeling Inventory and administered it to 253 7th grade students. The Inventory included three computer models that students interacted with during the assessment. In our sample, 99% of students identified at least one key rule underlying a model, but only 14% identified all key rules; 65% believed that model rules can contradict; and 98% could not distinguish between emergent patterns and behaviors that directly resulted from model rules. Despite these misconceptions, compared to the “typical” questions about the science content alone, questions about model rules elicited deeper science thinking, with 2--10 times more responses including reasoning about scientific mechanisms. These results suggest that incorporating computational thinking instruction into middle school science courses might yield deeper learning and more precise assessments around scientific models.},

abstract = {Consider the following scenario: A student is browsing Facebook and sees a strangely compelling image on her friend's page. She follows the "how I made this link" to learn more. She finds herself on a page with a gallery of animations that she browses. Then she sees a "Create" button and clicks it. She skims the instructions and decides that this is not a "standard" graphics program - rather than using a timeline and "tools", it has just a few basic images (e.g., a horizontal blend, a vertical blend, some time-blends) and a few operations that you use to build new images from existing images. She plays a bit. And she finds that she can create some strange and interesting images, but not necessarily the ones she wants to make, and certainly not anything like her friend made. So she looks further. She learns that there are "challenges" that help you learn the system (and, as importantly, that help you consider and master different aspects of computational thinking), and tries to figure out how to make images as seemingly simple as a triangle or a circle using the limited selection of basic images and operations. It's not easy, but she finds it fun to try (and sometimes more fun to fail -- failures also create interesting images). You've just read a sample encounter with the Mathematical Image Synthesis Toolkit, or MIST. MIST is an open-source, Web-based graphics application that takes a constructionist approach in which open experimentation in image making helps students develop skills in computational thinking and deepen their understanding of mathematical functions.

This paper investigates the extent to which teachers were able to successfully infuse CT skills of pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and algorithms into their learning products.In this work, we analyzed 58 teacher-designed programming products to look for common characteristics, such as project type, intended coding requirements for their students, and code features/functionality. Teacher-created products were classified into five types: animation, interactive story, quiz, intended game, and simulation/exploration tools. Coding requirements varied from using and/or explaining provided code, modifying existing code, programming with starter code, to building entire programs. Products were classified according to the extent to which they involved sprite manipulation, questions/answers, event handling, drawing, and control blocks. We found that teachers from different disciplines created products that vary in type, coding requirements, and features to suit their specific needs. Moreover, we found relationships between discipline, project type, and the required coding teachers expected students to do.Our results inform future Infusing Computing Professional Development (PD) to provide more targeted training to support different teacher needs.},

abstract = {Jeannette Wing's call for teaching Computational Thinking (CT) as a formative skill on par with reading, writing, and arithmetic places computer science in the category of basic knowledge. Just as proficiency in basic language arts helps us to effectively communicate and in basic math helps us to successfully quantitate, proficiency in computational thinking helps us to systematically and efficiently process information and tasks. But while teaching everyone to think computationally is a noble goal, there are pedagogical challenges. Perhaps the most confounding issue is the role of programming, and whether we can separate it from teaching basic computer science. How much programming, if any, should be required for CT proficiency?We believe that to successfully broaden participation in computer science, efforts must be made to lay the foundations of CT long before students experience their first programming language. We posit that programming is to Computer Science what proof construction is to mathematics, and what literary analysis is to English. Hence by analogy, programming should be the entrance into higher CS, and not the student's first encounter in CS. We argue that in the absence of programming, teaching CT should focus on establishing vocabularies and symbols that can be used to annotate and describe computation and abstraction, suggest information and execution, and provide notation around which mental models of processes can be built. Lastly, we conjecture that students with sustained exposure to CT in their formative education will be better prepared for programming and the CS curriculum, and, furthermore, that they might choose to major in CS not only for career opportunities, but also for its intellectual content.},

abstract = {Increasing the representation of minorities in computer science (CS) has become a national priority. One of the many reasons minority students nationwide choose not to study CS is that they often lack mentors and role models to encourage them early in their learning. In her seminal article, Jeannette Wing argues that computational thinking (CT) is an emerging essential skill that should become an integral part of K-12 education. However, a big issue facing this initiative is that many K-12 teachers find themselves lack (1) relevant materials, (2) systematic training, and (3) a supportive community. The democratization of media, such as photos and videos, has provided a great variety of options to educate a broad audience on myriad topics. In this poster, we will describe the challenges and successes of using animated videos including its beauty, soundness, and utility as critical elements in establishing a strong CT comprehension while engaging K-12 teachers in a non-threatening way. Using a process of iterative design, we have found ways to integrate CT concepts in six non-CS disciplines in the K-12 curriculum. The teachers who have collaborated with us respond positively that this design approach provides them with a greater comprehension of the CT concepts while giving them exciting instructional activities. Therefore, this poster may be of interest to any CS educator who wishes to improve the engagement of K-12 teachers while sustaining a CT training program at their institution.},

abstract = {The number of undergraduates entering computer science has declined in recent years. This is paralleled by a drop in the number of high school students taking the CS AP exam and the number of high schools offering computer science courses. The declines come at a time when career opportunities in CS continue to grow and computer science graduates are seen as crucial in building a globally competitive workforce for the 21st century. Efforts aimed at reversing the declining interest in computer science include curriculum revisions at the undergraduate level at many institutions, a re-design of computer science AP courses [1], and the inclusion of computational thinking into disciplines outside computer science [3].This panel discusses four projects of computer science researchers collaborating with high school teachers on integrating computing and computational thinking into their courses. The majority of the high school teachers involved is teaching science and math courses. They are teaching a diverse group of talented and college-bound students. The goal of all projects is to integrate computing into disciplines represented in the high school curriculum and to raise the awareness of computer science as an exciting and intellectually rewarding field.This panel will outline recent and on-going activities and interaction with high school teachers. Each panelist will describe how he/she got involved and the nature of the interaction. The panelists will talk about their individual projects, outline their visions for future interactions, and how their effort can be replicated by others. The session will briefly describe NSF's RET program which provided teacher support for three of the four projects. The session will then be opened for discussion; the audience will be encouraged to ask questions and contribute additional ideas for the inclusion of computational thinking in high school courses.},

The course is targeted to students who are mathematically under-prepared to enter our introductory programming sequence; however, it has recently been included in the University's general education curriculum so that students majoring in any discipline may take the course. Using the Whimbey Analytical Skills Inventory (WASI) students in the CS0 class, along with students in an analogous level engineering class (FESP), were tested at the beginning of the course and again at the end, using different versions of the test. The improvement in scores was statistically significant when measured by both the student t-test and the Cohen d (effect size) for CS0 students but not for the FESP students, providing support that the course does, in fact, increase student analytical problem solving skills. Courses in Computational Thinking have demonstrated success in many schools; however, this research demonstrates its effectiveness in improving analytical skills in majors as well as non-majors.},

This study extends this work by examining how middle school students translated their science fair projects into Scratch and what evidence of computational thinking is present. Scrape, a tool designed to analyze Scratch projects was used. Overall, it was found that most students simply created a presentation of their project without much complexity. Eight students created interactive projects that required user participation and used more advanced computational concepts. Finally, recommendations are given for next steps in the creation of a series of activities that would scaffold student learning as they apply to computational thinking concepts of a science concept.},

TunePad is designed to introduce learners to computational thinking and to prepare them for text-based coding environments. From our preliminary testing, with children ages 7-14, we observed that our design actively engages learners and communicates how the programming blocks control the sounds being played. This testing is a prelude to more formal studies as we continue to improve the design and interface of TunePad.

abstract = {Recruiting a precollege audience into computing disciplines can be challenging. One approach is to engage those that have a strong influence with the precollege students, K-12 teachers [16]. To engage these teachers, we held a Google-sponsored Computer Science for High School (CS4HS) workshop at our small university. The workshop, scheduled over a two day period, included presentations on the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) K-12 computer science curriculum standards, recruiting woman into computing disciplines, and careers in technology. Additionally, there were hands-on sessions with Scratch programming, FIRST robotics, computer hardware, programming in Excel, and CS Unplugged. A unique aspect of this workshop was that high school, middle school, and elementary school teachers, both in and out of technology-related disciplines, were invited to attend. Another unique aspect of our workshop was the inclusion of several sessions with activities for participants to create action plans for incorporating computational thinking components into the curriculum at their respective schools. This included a presentation from a former school superintendent on how to work with school districts in considering computer science as a component in the curriculum and several small-group working sessions to develop the action plans. Discussions with the attendees and subsequent surveys revealed some surprising information about perceptions that K-12 teachers had surrounding computer science and technology. This paper describes our experience with the workshop.},

abstract = {As computer science plays an increasingly large role in our lives, it is important to also move it into our classrooms. Computer science careers are among the fastest growing jobs, yet large groups of the population are severely underrepresented in computer science. Elementary school is a key time to introduce computer science or computational thinking because students are capable of programming and they will soon be deciding whether they see a future in the sciences. Including computational thinking as a part of the elementary school general education would give all children an introduction to the subject. In addition, elementary schools are looking for computational thinking material. We need appropriate, research-based tools and curricula for them to use.Unlike the natural sciences, computer science's domain is pliable. Through language and programming environments, developers can create new ways to represent computational thinking concepts. My research seeks 1) to understand how 4th through 6th grade students learn computational thinking, 2) to develop computational thinking learning progressions and curricula, and 3) to create a language and programming environment suitable for elementary school classes and teachers who do not have a computer science background.},

We have created what we call social computational thinking tools with the goal to synthesize human abilities with computer affordances. This presentation will outline three social computational thinking tools and discuss how they have combined notions of design and social media to create unique learning experiences in the classroom:1) Mr. Vetro is a Collective Simulation teaching students about human physiology through technologically enhanced role play of interacting organs,2) Scalable Game Design teaches students computational thinking through game design. They learn about computational thinking patterns in the context of game design and later apply these patterns to scientific simulation building.3) CyberCollage is a Collective Programming environment enabling students to work on game and simulation projects collaboratively in real time.},

abstract = {SIGCSE members love the beauty of computational thinking. They know the joy of bringing those ideas to young people. That love for computational thinking entails respect for the computational values that empower people in the digital world. For academics, those values have been central to the flowering of computing as an intellectual endeavor. Today, those values are increasingly threatened by stresses from both within and outside academia: squabbles over who owns academic work, increasingly stringent and overreaching intellectual property laws, and the replacement of open computing platforms by closed applications and walled-garden application markets.In this talk I'll describe some things we've done at MIT to support computational values, like open publication of all our course materials, our faculty policy on open publication of academic research, and our recently announced initiative for open online instruction based on non-proprietary software platforms. I'll discuss Creative Commons licensing and Free Software, and the importance of tinkerability for empowering citizens in an information society. And I'll describe App Inventor for Android, a new programming tool motivated by the vision that all of us us can experience mobile computing as creators using tools that we can control and reshape, rather than only as consumers of packaged applications.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has received increased attention over the past several years and is considered by many to be a fundamental and necessary literacy for children. One approach to teaching this skill has been through tangible programming since it facilitates intuitive interaction with children. In this paper, we introduce CodeTrain and CodeBox, two motorized toys whose behavior can be programmed through wooden building blocks without the use of a computer, tablet, or screen-based interface. The goal with both these designs is to foster playful exploration of computational thinking in pre-adolescent children through tangible objects. We describe the design process from the conceptual design to the functional prototype. Furthermore, we present first impressions of the prototypes from a pilot study and highlight some lessons learned from our first iteration.},

To these ends, we used several data collection tools through a mainly qualitative exploratory approach: semi-guided interviews, diaries and several questionnaires. We have learned that: (1) the KCK is versatile enough to adapt to different environments, objectives and pedagogical approaches and thus offers a great deal of freedom to teachers, (2) the playful and tangible approach of the KCK seems more adapted to introducing programming and enables pupils to develop problem-solving, collaboration and creativity skills, and (3) if the user experience has been positive for both teachers and students, this first KCK prototype is still addressing intermediate computer-skilled teachers.},

abstract = {In recent years, several research projects have introduced elementary school teachers to computational thinking as a first step in familiarizing students with computer science concepts at an early age. A consistent challenge reported in these initiatives is teaching abstraction. This position paper offers preliminary recommendations for abstraction pedagogy in elementary education. These suggestions stem from an analysis of unplugged abstraction examples showcased during a summer institute on computational thinking.By examining commonalities among abstraction examples, key parts of the process of abstraction pertinent to elementary classrooms were identified: (1) the abstraction process is typically performed in reverse since students in elementary school are given abstractions to start with; (2) evaluation of concrete details to support an abstraction is part of the filtering step of abstraction; (3) in the absence of evaluation criteria, pattern recognition can be applied to a set of concrete examples to extract characteristics of an abstraction; and (4) abstractions can be supported by not only concrete details but other abstractions which students will need to develop an understanding of before fully comprehending the initial concept.Preliminary recommendations for abstraction instruction include having students evaluate examples; engaging students in pattern recognition to extract characteristics of an abstraction; developing student fluency in describing abstractions, their supporting examples, and characteristics; and assessing students by asking not only for examples of abstractions, but for their characteristics as well.},

abstract = {To broaden participation in computing we need to look beyond traditional domains of inquiry and expertise. We present results from a demonstration project in which interactive journalism was used to infuse computational thinking into the standard curriculum and regular classroom experience at a middle school with a diverse population. Outcomes indicate that we were able to develop positive attitudes about computational thinking and programming among students and teachers who did not necessarily view themselves as “math types.” By partnering with language arts, technology and math teachers at Fisher Middle School, Ewing New Jersey, we introduced the isomorphism between the journalistic process and computational thinking to 7th and 8th graders. An intense summer institute, first with the teachers and then with students recruited from the school, immersed them in the “newsroom of the future” where they researched and wrote news stories, shot and edited video, and developed procedural animations in Scratch to support their storylines. An afterschool club sustained the experience. The teachers adapted interactive journalism and Scratch programming to enrich standard language arts curriculum and are infusing computational thinking in classroom experiences throughout the school.},

Thailand has also recently included Scratch as part of the computing science course in its basic education. However, Thailand is facing a shortage of ICT teachers who are skillful in Scratch programming, especially in small provincial schools. This research aims to overcome the shortage by developing ScratchThAI, a Scratch tutorial chatbot. It is designed to assist young learners directly through a messaging platform. By giving supports through a textual conversation, more relevant advice, knowledge, and resources could be provided precisely. Different levels of each computational thinking concept are extracted and evaluated by the designed assessment algorithm. Extra predefined exercises are assigned based on the analyzed learner's strengths and weaknesses in order to actively improving the learner's understanding. Moreover, gamification is incorporated to engage and motivate young learners in computational thinking development.},

Based on previous studies showing that semiotic relations among visual game elements could be further explored to the benefit of the learners, we designed PoliFacets, a Web extension to AgentSheets cast as a live conversational document. With it, teachers and learners can follow different threads of conversation about (multiple representations of) game elements and relations between them. We present a qualitative evaluation study of PoliFacets with two experienced AgentSheets instructors and three school teachers trained to coach students in CTA programs. Findings show that although our system has not yet completely fulfilled our design intent, it has led participants to gain relevant insights about their teaching and learning, as well as to articulating doubts and misunderstandings that otherwise could have gone unnoticed.},

abstract = {Games have been designed to foster children's computational thinking (CT) skills, which is widely recognized as a key ability that should be mastered in this computing-driven era. Because learning coding skills is cognitively difficult and uninvolving for novices and it is recommended to learn CT concepts first, many educational games have been developed to teach CT in a non-coding environment. However, despite the breadth of such games and the demand for it, little is known about how to design such games or why such games are designed in a particular way. To address this gap, this paper presents a design framework that describes the building blocks for developing (non-coding) gameplay elements in games teaching CT. The framework focuses specifically on computational problem-solving because this is where games can specifically aid with. We illustrate the design framework through LittleWorld, a mobile game that teaches CT concepts through insects.},

abstract = {Teachers are increasingly integrating computational thinking (CT) into subject-area learning opportunities with the aim to meet both subject-area and CT learning goals. While prior work has identified CT practices synergistic to subject-area learning, less is published about pedagogical frameworks for instructional practices when integrating CT into content area teaching. This poster presents data from educators (teachers and professional developers) about what they find to be crucial factors for designing and implementing CT integrated lessons. Preliminary analysis indicates educators advocate for twenty practices including creating reflection opportunities, actively using CT vocabulary, opportunities for students to practice CT skills, meaningful real-world connections, utilizing scaffolding strategies, explicitly introducing CT practices, clear connections between CT and curricular content, using multiple modalities, and encouraging student discourse.},

abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence present a need for fostering AI literacy in workplaces. While there is a lack of research on how this can be achieved, there are documented successful approaches in child-computer interaction (CCI), albeit aimed at K-12 education. We present an in-vivo explorative case study of how CCI approaches can be adopted for adult professionals via a full-day workshop developed in collaboration with a trade union to upskill workers. Analyzing data from pre- and post-surveys, a follow-up survey, and materials produced by participants (n=53), we demonstrate how this increased participants’ knowledge of AI while their self-efficacy and empowerment did not improve. This is similar to findings from K-12 education, pointing to self-efficacy and empowerment as major challenges for AI literacy across sectors. We discuss the role of ambassadorships and professional organizations in addressing these issues, and indicate research directions for the CHI community.},

abstract = {Modern biology has transformed from an insular entity into an interdisciplinary science, which in turn demands interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary training for future work force in biology and life sciences. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to address questions in a broad range of subjects, and as such, computational thinking offers an important skill set in modern sciences. Despite its importance, the concept of computational thinking has generally been side-stepped in undergraduate biology education. Many students in life sciences are often weak in quantitative/computing skills and tend to avoid computing-orient courses. To address these issues, we incorporated computational thinking into a bioinformatics course for undergraduate life science majors. We developed comprehensive computer laboratory exercises that offer hands-on learning experience for the targeted student pool, and employed peer-assisted collaborative learning environment. Preliminary results of these explorative efforts will be helpful for others to teach computational thinking to biology students.},

abstract = {The increased interest in promoting CS education for all has been coalescing around the idea of "computational thinking." Several framings for promoting computational thinking in K-12 education have been proposed by practitioners and researchers that each place different emphases on either (1) skill and competence building, (2) creative expression and participation, or (3) social justice and ethics. We review each framing and how the framings structure the theory space of computational thinking. We then discuss how CS education can leverage the explanatory potential that each framing offers to the implementation and evaluation of learning, teaching, and tools in computing education. Our goal is to help CS education researchers, teachers, and designers unpack and leverage the complexities of this theory space (rather than ignoring it) while also addressing broader educational concerns regarding diversity, providing new directions for how students and teachers can actively participate in designing their digital futures, and directing current computing education efforts towards a more humanistic orientation.},

Faculty at Towson University from Computer Science, English, Kinesiology, Music, and Sociology jointly formulated courses that involved applying and connecting ideas for analytic and creative purposes across fields. We respectively experimented with identifying concepts and with using these tools in our respective areas or fields; we also worked towards identifying what aspects or features of computational thinking might be generalized for broader educational purposes. The courses included "Everyday Computational Thinking" (Computer Science), "Revolutionary Networks" (Sociology), "Creative Work with Audio and Visual" (Music), "Computational Thinking in the Humanities" (English), and "Developing Life Skills for Weight Management" (Kinesiology). From the perspective of the humanities and music, much was learned by way of the limits of computation as an explanatory model for the expressive dimensions of our fields; that said, much was also learned about how the constraints it presented could enhance and generate new possibilities for analysis and creativity. The more quantitative-based disciplines likewise explored some applications of computational thinking for more dynamic approaches to problem-solving in everyday contexts and lives. The panel will include several faculty involved in the project who will share their experiences and learning outcomes in brief (approximately 10-minute "flash" presentations with lots of handouts), and we will invite audience inquiries about the challenges experienced in collaborating for such an interdisciplinary project and how what we learned will inform future goals and initiatives.},

This work grows out of a collaboration with colleagues in Australia, whose research is focused on the use of information technology in the cultural practices of indigenous Australian groups, particularly the Yolngu of Northeast Arnhemland. Yolngu epistemology provides an interesting starting point for reconsidering aspects of computational practice, which suggests new perspectives on computational thinking and its practice, and on the possible relationship between computer science and other disciplines.},

This has been investigated in an iterative process, by conducting 21 workshops with the goal to support primary school teachers in developing micro:bit teaching materials. The contribution of this paper is the Scope of autonomy model, which is based on the relation between pupils learning potential, their risk of feeling overwhelmed and the amount of choices provided in exercises. The model aim to support teachers in developing material for teaching programming and computational thinking in accordance with the new curriculum.},

In the first two years of this NSF-funded three-year project, we have developed, piloted and assessed five computational thinking general education courses - an Everyday Computational Thinking course, and four discipline-specific computational thinking general education courses. Initial assessments show promising and significant student, instructor and administration interest in computational thinking as a basis in courses covering multiple disciplines within the general education curriculum.},

abstract = {The creation of computer science tutorials is becoming critically important as hundreds of millions of students each year get their first CS experience through self-directed online activities. Creating a "cliffhanger" activity, with high engagement during and motivation to continue learning post activity, is a balancing act. If tutorials provide too much detailed information, users may be able to follow instructions but can feel overwhelmed or bored. On the other hand, tutorials that do not sufficiently explain crucial steps risk frustrating users who might drop out of the activity. Zones of Proximal Flow (ZPF) tutorials are simple to create and provide a navigation structure of differentiated instruction allowing users to choose appropriate detail based on their self-assessed state of flow, from bored to anxious. Using Retention of Flow analysis, two Hour of Code game design tutorials were analyzed: a sophisticated online tutorial for the creation of Frogger, and a simple ZPF tutorial for the creation of Pac-Man. One hope was that the simple ZPF Pac-Man tutorial would not do much worse than the sophisticated Frogger tutorial, but surprisingly the ZPF Pac-Man tutorial significantly outperformed the Frogger tutorial in terms of student retention. The Pac-Man tutorial also displayed a high student motivation to continue programming past the end of differentiated instruction.},

abstract = {Systematic endeavors to take computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) to scale in middle and high school classrooms are underway with curricula that emphasize the enactment of authentic CT skills, especially in the context of programming in block-based programming environments. There is, therefore, a growing need to measure students’ learning of CT in the context of programming and also support all learners through this process of learning computational problem solving. The goal of this research is to explore hypothesis-driven approaches that can be combined with data-driven ones to better interpret student actions and processes in log data captured from block-based programming environments with the goal of measuring and assessing students’ CT skills. Informed by past literature and based on our empirical work examining a dataset from the use of the Fairy Assessment in the Alice programming environment in middle schools, we present a framework that formalizes a process where a hypothesis-driven approach informed by Evidence-Centered Design effectively complements data-driven learning analytics in interpreting students’ programming process and assessing CT in block-based programming environments. We apply the framework to the design of Alice tasks for high school CS to be used for measuring CT during programming.},

However, a majority of these kits ask children to move a robot/character around a limited space, constraining what could otherwise be generative and creative learning experiences into pre-defined activities and challenges with uniform outcomes. How can we expand what children can program and how they can create code? In this work, we present CodeAttach, a learning kit designed to engage young children in computational thinking through physical play activities. CodeAttach consists of three parts: (1) an interactive hardware device, (2) a mobile application to program the device, and (3) supporting materials for different play activities. With CodeAttach, children can attach the device to the supporting materials or other everyday objects to create their own props for physical play. The device offers different inputs and outputs and supports children to change the rules of existing physical activities or create new activities by programming this device. We outline the principles guiding the design of CodeAttach, its initial development process, and insights from early playtest with young kids and expert researchers.},

Participatory design and cooperative prototyping offer opportunities for identifying challenges in computing education and ways for teachers to be involved in the design of new learning tools. This study describes the process of codesigning a learning tool to overcome some of these challenges for computing education in high school, involving teachers, developers, and researchers as collaborators. The study investigating how cooperative prototyping and participatory design can lead to mutual learning about challenges in teaching computing. We prototyped learning activities and the learning tool, CoTinker, in collaboration between six teachers, two developers, and four researchers in four subcases and implemented them in classrooms with a total of 83 students. We show how challenges such as students' collaboration and transfer of knowledge in computing education were overcome by applying the prototypes in computing education classrooms in high school.},

Data is collected from teachers, academics, and professionals, purposively selected because of their knowledge of the topics of problem solving, computational thinking, or the teaching of programming. This data is analysed following a grounded theory approach. A computational thinking taxonomy is developed. The relationships between cognitive processes, the pedagogy of programming, and the perceived levels of difficulty of computational thinking skills are illustrated by a model.Specifically, a definition for computational thinking is presented. The skills identified are mapped to Bloom's Taxonomy: Cognitive Domain. This mapping concentrates computational skills at the application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation levels. Analysis of the data indicates that abstraction of functionality is less difficult than abstraction of data, but both are perceived as difficult. The most difficult computational thinking skill is reported as decomposition. This ordering of difficulty for learners is a reversal of the cognitive complexity predicted by Bloom's model. The plausibility of this inconsistency is explored.The taxonomy, model, and the other results of this study may be used by educators to focus learning onto the computational thinking skills acquired by the learners, while using programming as a tool. They may also be employed in the design of curriculum subjects, such as ICT, computing, or computer science.},

Widely recognized as a "basic skill" necessary for economic opportunity and social mobility, integrating computing within K12 STEM supports learners of all ages in applying computational thinking within established and accessible contexts while co-developing practices essential to mathematical and scientific expertise. The EcoMOD project is an example of such an integration. In EcoMOD, immersive virtual environments are blended with interactive computational modeling tools designed specifically for younger children in an attempt to support ecological knowledge, complex causal reasoning and computational creation in third grade students. Our curricular design is grounded in the Science-as-Practice perspective and literature on young children's computing. In this proposal, we present outcomes from early pilot work with 35 third graders across the greater Boston area. This work has implications for designers of educational technologies by illuminating aspects of children's understanding that researchers and designers can leverage to support deeper and earlier understandings of ecological dynamics and computational practices.},

We will provide access to materials that participants can adapt for their own courses to redesign existing courseware: best practices; pitfalls to be avoided and how to deal with them; instructional materials developed for the courses used in our project; assessment and evaluation instruments developed for the courses used in our project; instructions on adapting the assessment and evaluation instruments for other courses; instructions, documentation, and configuration scripts for using the technology needed for such collaborations.

abstract = {Coding for computer programming is a common way to support and assess computational thinking (CT) skills, a set of problem-solving skills essential for computer science (CS) and STEM more broadly. We designed a coding platform, Fox and Field, to determine what kinds of scaffolds can encourage novice coders to behave more like experts. We compared actions between 221 upper-division undergraduate CS/engineering (expert, n=106) and social science (novice, n=115) majors randomized to scaffolding conditions from four universities in the United States. Overall, experts used statistically significantly more practices aligned with CT skills, such as those that increased code efficiency (e.g., non-right angle turns, loops). This difference disappeared when novices were scaffolded by being told to use fewer codes or by priming with critical features. Both experts and novices were equally likely to be swayed by purposefully distracting features within the platform, such as a drawn path to deflect them from the most efficient solution. Results present initial evidence regarding which features of coding platforms can direct students to exercise CT-linked practices, leading to recommendations regarding platform development to better support learning.},

abstract = {Computational thinking knowledge is used to develop solutions for computational problems, such as those found in mathematics and computer science. Over the past several years, workshops on computational thinking and computer science tools have been provided to high school teachers, most recently as part of Google's Computer Science for High School (CS4HS) initiative. The lasting impact of these workshops on the high school teachers and their students after the teacher returns to the classroom is not well known. The computational thinking knowledge and tools of high school teachers in a regional area of the U. S. was assessed during two workshops, one held several months after the other, to determine the utility and benefit, if any, of the workshops for the teachers and their students. The results of this research contribute to understanding the perception of computational thinking and computer science among high school teachers, as well as to the identification of the best tools and resources which high school teachers are most likely to use and which can be used to implement computational thinking in core curriculum standards, including mathematics.},

abstract = {Educational games have a potentially significant role to play in the increasing efforts to expand access to computer science education. Computational thinking is an area of particular interest, including the development of problem-solving strategies like divide and conquer. Existing games designed to teach computational thinking generally consist of either open-ended exploration with little direct guidance or a linear series of puzzles with lots of direct guidance, but little exploration. Educational research indicates that the most effective approach may be a hybrid of these two structures. We present Dragon Architect, an educational computational thinking game, and use it as context for a discussion of key open problems in the design of games to teach computational thinking. These problems include how to directly teach computational thinking strategies, how to achieve a balance between exploration and direct guidance, and how to incorporate engaging social features. We also discuss several important design challenges we have encountered during the design of Dragon Architect. We contend the problems we describe are relevant to anyone making educational games or systems that need to teach complex concepts and skills.},

This article presents a qualitative case study that follows five undergraduate biology majors in a computer science course (CS0). This CS0 course teaches programming within a data-driven context and is part of a university-wide initiative to improve students' quantitative scholarship. In this course, students learn computing concepts and computational thinking by writing programs in MATLAB that compute with data, by performing meaningful analyses, and by writing about the results. The goal of the study reported here is to better understand the thought processes students use in such a data-driven approach. Findings show that students engage in an ongoing organizational process to understand the structure of the data. The computational and visualization tasks appear to be closely linked, and the visualization component appears to provide valuable feedback for students in accomplishing the programming tasks.},

To support assessment of student learning in BBPEs, we propose a learning analytics framework that combines hypothesis- and data-driven approaches to discern students' programming strategies from BBPE log data. We use a principled approach to design assessment tasks to elicit evidence of specific CT skills. Piloting these tasks in high school classrooms enabled us to analyze student programs and video recordings of students as they built their programs. We discuss a priori patterns derived from this analysis to support data-driven analysis of log data in order to better assess understanding and use of CT in BBPEs.},

abstract = {This systematic mapping review sheds light on how emerging technologies have been introduced and taught in various K–12 learning settings, particularly with regard to artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). These technologies are rapidly being integrated into children's everyday lives, but their functions and implications are rarely understood due to their complex and distributed nature. The review provides a rigorous overview of the state of the art based on 107 records published across the fields of human-computer interaction, learning sciences, computing education, and child–computer interaction between 2010 and 2020.&nbsp;The findings show the urgent need on a global scale for inter- and transdisciplinary research that can integrate these dispersed contributions into a more coherent field of research and practice. The article presents nine discussion points for developing a shared agenda to mature the field. Based on the HCI community's expertise in human-centred approaches to technology and aspects of learning, we argue that the community is ideally positioned to take a leading role in the realisation of this future research agenda.},

To mitigate the risks of sustainability threats, data-and-theory driven scientific models, artistic practices, and environment designs play a critical role. However, these methods alone fail to reach a broader audience and translate into public discourse for participatory collective action. In this paper, we present Beyond Boundaries, a renaissance that re-envisions the relationship between ecological arts and computational thinking to contextualize threats to sustainability at regional and global scales. We establish an integrated framework combining Earth remote sensing satellite time-series, half a decade of ecological arts, and a public exhibition to curate the symbiotic relationship between arts and science. Beyond Boundaries sheds new light on how synergistic associations among disciplines can inspire scientific inquiry, artistic imaginations, and civic engagement-and-discourse for sustainability.},

abstract = {Conventionally creativity is often conceived as an aptitude to be discovered in an individual that cannot be mathematically measured. But the concept of creative thinking as a divergence from a standard "norm" is used in creativity research for the purpose of assessing creativity and is also linked to non-traditional or creative processes that lead to unique and divergent artifacts [1,2]. Using Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis (CTPA)[3], the divergence between implemented computational thinking patterns in a student-created game, and that game's tutorial "norm" is calculated as an indicator of creativity. Through a case study of one teacher using three unique learning conditions, CTPA's computed divergence is explored as a valid measurement of creativity in these student games.},

We present the results of 103 semi-structured play sessions spread over three months with 12 children (2 girls, 10 boys) with diverse backgrounds. We found that children progressed from playing with pre-connected examples, to making changes, to actively participating in what items are played. Engaging the children in conversation while they played, we established that the teams had grasped three basic concepts of computational thinking--flow of control, variables, and loops, without any explicit instructions towards learning them. We propose that play-based approaches can be successfully used with low resource overhead to introduce fundamental concepts of CT.},

abstract = {Even before entering middle school students have been exposed to some of the conceptual methods and skill sets that underlie computational thinking (CT). For example, elementary school aged children begin using problem-solving and abstraction in Mathematics, English and Geography when they study word problems, learn about sentence structures and grammar rules, and work with maps. However, prior to middle school the problem sets tend to be concrete and scaffolded to aid the student in learning the foundations needed to work with complex problems. As children develop their cognitive capacities, they should be able to explore and learn about CT in a more abstract and generalizable fashion. However, when computing technology is added to the design and implementation of a solution it can be overwhelming for those who may not be comfortable turning to technology for answers. For this reason, problem solving can be difficult for young people who haven't learned the role technology may have in their lives now or in the future.},

Informatics didactics experts and teacher trainers have to inform them and reveal connections between their primary school contents and different informatics concepts. Furthermore, one general educational aim of the curriculum is the acquisition of elementary cultural techniques including a child-friendly approach to modern information and communication technologies (ICT). The aim of this paper is to show how this is possible in practice and lists informatics concepts already "hidden" in the primary school curriculum. It reports on different initiatives that aim at introducing informatics in primary schools as well as a sample project on computational thinking funded by the regional teacher support program Teaching Informatics creatively. The qualitative results of this and other primary school projects show that it is possible and worth integrating informatics already at this early stage.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is key to digital literacy and helps develop problem-solving skills, which are fundamental in modern school. As game design shows potential for teaching CT, metrics like Dr. Scratch emerge that help scholars systematically assess the CT of student-designed games, particularly with Scratch. Compared to other CT metrics, Dr. Scratch scores the CT of Scratch projects automatically and can be used to describe CT development. However, previous research using Dr. Scratch summatively assessed CT, but did not look at CT development. We use Dr. Scratch to assess the CT development of Scratch games designed by 8th-grade students in STEM curricula. We show how CT proficiency in student-designed games develops differently in each CT dimension, where parallelism, synchronization, and logic develop proficiently, while developing abstraction seems hard. We discuss insights into game-based CT development for STEM, and suggest improvements for metric-based CT assessment.},

abstract = {The extensive research in the domain of computational thinking has identified itself as one of the critical skills that needs to be a part of regular K-12 curriculum. However, most of the tangible computational thinking toolkits that are being developed are bulky and expensive to be deployed in classroom environments. In this paper we present Code Bits, a paper based tangible computational thinking toolkit that is inexpensive, portable and scalable. The students create programs using the tangible paper bits on any flat surface and use the Code Bits mobile application to process the code, which runs on any android device with a camera and uses augmented reality based games to improve the computational thinking skills of the students. The toolkit has been designed in way so as to promote collaboration amongst students.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly seen as a core literacy skill for the modern world on par with the longestablished skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic. To promote the learning of CT at a young age we capitalized on children's interest in play. We designed RabBit EscApe, a board game that challenges children, ages 610, to orient tangible, magnetized manipulatives to complete or create paths. We also ran an informal study to investigate the effectiveness of the game in fostering children's problemsolving capacity during collaborative game play. We used the results to inform our instructional interaction design that we think will better support the learning activities and help children hone the involved CT skills. Overall, we believe in the power of such games to challenge children to grow their understanding of CT in a focused and engaging activity.},

However, developing effective adaptive programming tasks can be challenging, particularly when it comes to selecting the appropriate changes and adapting the difficulty of the exercise. In this paper, we propose a model for tracking student knowledge and adapting programming exercises to guide the selection and implementation of task features. Our model combines aspects of cognitive load, computational thinking and feature-oriented software product line engineering to identify core and optional features, so that they can be used in conjunction to adapt to the specific needs and abilities of each student. We provide an overview over the insights gained from an exploratory study with students. To support the creation process of feature-based programming tasks, we present an approach using a template-based generator.},

abstract = {We present ENGAGE, a game-based learning environment for teaching computational thinking to middle school students. This project has dual aims: introducing computational thinking practices to students at a young age, and improving computational thinking attitudes among underrepresented students. In pursuit of these two goals, the ENGAGE team has mapped the learning objectives of the AP CS Principles course to the middle school level, and then built an immersive game experience upon that foundation. Students choose computer scientist avatars to represent themselves, and then play in pairs as they investigate a data-related mystery in an underwater research station, solving computational thinking challenges along the way. ENGAGE is currently being implemented as part of a quarterly elective in four middle schools in North Carolina. During the elective, students spend a total of ten classroom sessions playing the game, supplemented by "unplugged" activities that reinforce concepts learned in the game environment. We plan to expand to more middle schools in the 2015-2016 school year. In this demo, members of the SIGCSE community will be able to experience the ENGAGE game for themselves and learn more about its development and future directions. We will also discuss our success in recruiting and teaching the ENGAGE curriculum to middle school teachers who had no prior computer science experience, and the success of those middle school teachers in implementing ENGAGE within their classrooms.},

The influence of high school math and science teachers is important, both for high school preparation of future computer science undergraduates, and for the understanding and interest in prospective majors high school teachers can encourage in their students. With the simultaneous decline in high school computer science curriculum offerings and undergraduate majors in computer science, an effort has been made to update the perception of computer science and computational thinking among high school teachers by hosting local non-residential summer workshops for high school teachers and their students.Pre- and post- workshop surveys show that the summer workshops have changed the perceptions high school teachers had regarding careers in computer science, resulting in a 50% increase in the likelihood that a high school teacher would recommend computer science, computational science, or information technology to their students as a career. By changing teacher perceptions of computer science and computational thinking, high school teachers are more likely to include computer science as one of the college majors suggested to their students.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a common topic within the computing K-12 curricula worldwide. While much of the focus of research is on the use of Generative AI in and for education, AI as a core subject area is still gaining popularity, with much of this research focusing on content and tools that effectively support the teaching of AI. However, as we grow as a field, there is a need currently unmet to provide foundations (in the form of a block model as there exists for programming) to allow researchers to build strong pedagogies and methodologies from, and even a base to design activities and content. Compounding this, as ethics and its relationship to AI in the K-12 classroom grows stronger, there is a further need to provide scaffolding to educators and researchers not only on traditional AI concepts, but also on how they link with ethical knowledge, skills and dispositions. In this paper, the Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) Block Model is developed and introduced. This is a competence-based model to guide effective teaching and learning of Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, as well as research in the K-12 space. The HCAI Block model’s foundation is developed/adapted from the programming Block model and has been adapted and developed using two lenses. The first was through the data science lens through interaction with Computational Thinking 2.0 and competency-based learning. The second lens was through a human-centred lens. The outcome was a ground-up K-12 model where traditional and technical AI concepts have been developed from the start, integrating ethical considerations and human-centred approaches.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is recognised as one of the fundamental skills of all graduates. Nevertheless, some issues can emerge when trying to introduce CT into schools; for example, teachers might not be willing to add topics to their intensive syllabi. Therefore, out-of-school venues such as summer schools can be considered a great opportunity for exposure to CT. Moreover, summer schools allow students to meet first hand researchers and help them pursue their interest far from the regular school climate. High school students in general are very curious for the creation of mobile apps; however, most of them get discouraged because they perceive this activity as a very difficult task. Here we describe the MobileDev summer school, a one-week training and hands-on experience in current topics of software development for mobile devices. The curiosity of the students for developing mobile apps is used to introduce and train CT via programming mobile applications through exercises (also with "pen and paper'") of increasing difficulty. The school was repeated twice at our university and was targeted to a reduced class of students concluding the third and the fourth year of high school. Participants were in total 19 and coming from different types of schools. This paper describes the structure of MobileDev and discusses the results to provide directions for further research.},

During the game, players' robots compete against a series of progressively more challenging opponents in one-on-one battles. Through playing the game, players construct working programs, providing learners with the experience of reifying their own ideas using a computational medium, a practice central to our notion of computational thinking. This poster presents the design rationale for RoboBuilder and discusses key aspects of the game that contribute to giving learners a positive, hands-on introduction to core computational thinking skills including computationally expressing ideas, algorithmic thinking, and debugging.},

abstract = {CS0 and CS1 courses are becoming an essential part of many social science programs, including sociology and political science. This particular assignment was designed as part of the 'Basics of Programming in Python' course for undergraduate political science students. The course aims not only to prepare students for the unified programming exam, but also to apply concepts of computational thinking in the context of political science problems. By linking these fields, students learn to overcome inner barriers in coding and explore the potential of computational social science methods for both academic path and career.  This project seeks such a connection between subjects of political science major as Comparative Electoral Systems and Quantitative Methods of Political Research, and concepts of computer science. Students process the generated votes, applying critical thinking to identify spoilt ballots, and then formulate rules for counting votes (First-past-the-post, Borda count, Condorcet winner criterion) in algorithmic form. Optionally, a short essay can be added in which students are asked to speculate about political leanings, the transitivity of preferences and the advantages/disadvantages of particular electoral systems based on analyses of the data in the assignment. As the result, students not only develop hard skills in programming, but most importantly conceptualize complicated topics through the prism of their specialization, fostering the ability to see the connections between these fields and understand how they can work together to address complex real-world scenarios.},

The kit combines the microcontroller with relays and a web application, enabling students to connect everyday objects to the Internet and visualize the devices’ data flow. Based on an intervention in a secondary school with 3 teachers and 20 students of ages 12-13, our results indicate that the design and features of the kit — internet communication and data visualization — support teachers to engage students in learning about a holistic perspective of IoT. We reflect on our research propositions, discuss design strategies, and present three design recommendations for IoT toolkits: Connectivity, Visualization, and Openness.},

Most schools in our region have eliminated computer science classes from the curriculum. Alabama has an existing state initiative to improve mathematics, science and technology education in K-12. The Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) emphasizes learning by doing, with hands-on, activity based instruction. We have developed an instructional treatment that uses strategically designed computer exercises to push students to form the mental foundation necessary for abstraction and generalization. We selected popular problems from the AMSTI mathematics curriculum and applied our instructional design.The first step we took in implementing our plan for reintroducing computational thinking into the secondary schools was to conduct a workshop for math education leaders. This training was sponsored and supported by AMSTI. Results from the workshop included demonstrating to a select group of math education leaders that computer programming could be easily integrated with the AMSTI math curriculum and could be used to meet the educational goals of the initiative and the educators.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) education reaches only a fraction of young children, in part because CT learning tools often require expensive hardware or fluent literacy. Block-based programming environments address these challenges through symbolic graphical interfaces, but users often need instructor support to advance. Alternatively, voice-based tools provide direct instruction on CT concepts but can present memory and navigation challenges to users. In this work, we present Visual StoryCoder, a multimodal tablet application that combines the strengths of each of these approaches to overcome their respective weaknesses. Visual StoryCoder introduces children ages 5–8 to CT through creative storytelling, offers direct instruction via a pedagogical voice agent, and eases use through a block-like graphical interface. In a between-subjects evaluation comparing Visual StoryCoder to a leading block-based programming app for this age group (N = 24), we show that Visual StoryCoder is more understandable to independent learners, leads to higher-quality code after app familiarization, and encourages personally meaningful projects.},

abstract = {Refactoring presents a complex computational challenge, and its learning is intricate, requiring a solid foundation in computational thinking, programming and object-oriented concepts. Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

abstract = {As Computational Thinking (CT) continues to permeate younger age groups in K-12 education, established CT platforms such as Scratch face challenges in catering to these younger learners, particularly those in the elementary school (ages 6-12). Through formative investigation with Scratch experts, we uncover three key obstacles to children’s autonomous Scratch learning: artist’s block in project planning, bounded creativity in asset creation, and inadequate coding guidance during implementation. To address these barriers, we introduce ChatScratch, an AI-augmented system to facilitate autonomous programming learning for young children. ChatScratch employs structured interactive storyboards and visual cues to overcome artist’s block, integrates digital drawing and advanced image generation technologies to elevate creativity, and leverages Scratch-specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for professional coding guidance. Our study shows that, compared to Scratch, ChatScratch efficiently fosters autonomous programming learning, and contributes to the creation of high-quality, personally meaningful Scratch projects for children.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, schools around the world have introduced coding in elementary education. A principal challenge with this effort is effectively training and maintaining teachers capable of teaching coding to children. An approach used by BootUp Professional Development is to team up with school districts that provide an Instructional Coach (IC). ICs are district-level personnel that support in-service teachers by co-planning, training, modeling, providing resources, and generally supporting teachers to implement coding in their classrooms. ICs remain in the district long after the professional development provider completes their training, potentially addressing training challenges introduced by teacher attrition. Some of the benefits provided by ICs are: (a) longevity, (b) expertise, and (c) near-peer support. However, the roles and responsibilities of ICs vary by district. In this study, we surveyed 49 ICs to better understand their role in supporting elementary teachers to integrate coding into general education. Findings show that while ICs are experienced teachers, they are relatively novice coders. ICs rely on principals and district personnel to set teachers' coding expectations, which can either help or hinder their ability to support teachers. In this poster, we will discuss additional successes, challenges, and support structures that ICs face as they seek to support the effective teaching of coding in elementary education.},

abstract = {This article proposes and explores the kinds of computational thinking, creative practices, design activities, and inclusive learning opportunities provided to diverse high school youth when designing integrated systems through simultaneously physically and digitally responsive wearable games and systems. Previous work in this area, conducted by Richard, coined the term “bidirectionally responsive design” (BRD) to describe the design of dual-feedback systems using multiple digital and physical interfaces. BRD also emphasizes using simplified fabrication tools, media and coding platforms, and microcontrollers common in youth content creation communities and makerspaces. This study provides a framework to analyze computational concepts, practices, and perspectives that leverage an integrated systems and multimodal learning approach, such as BRD, adding to, building on, and integrating previous analytic approaches to looking at Scratch coding, media design, physical computing and e-textiles. Using a detailed case study of one team during one of the early workshop iterations, we conduct a multimodal analysis of bidirectionally responsive making activities and discuss the ways that they present novel understanding of integrating diverse interests and encouraging collaborative and distributed computational thinking. We further examine how BRD operationalizes and extends multimodal learning theory by adding tangible and integrative dimensions as additional modalities learners can leverage to facilitate meaning making, metacognition, and agency. We also discuss how designing integrated systems, as facilitated through BRD, provides an opportunity to engage in authentic practices around the design of complex systems.},

Mirroring this trend is a concomitant interest in teaching young people about intelligent technologies. Whereas previous research in the field of Child–Computer Interaction has proposed curriculum and learning activities that describe what teenagers need to learn about AI/ML, there is still a shortage of studies which specifically address teenager-centered perspectives in the teaching of AI/ML. This paper presents a study of teenagers’ everyday understanding of AI/ML technologies. Using a thematic analysis of the teenagers’ own explanations during a series of workshops, we present a conceptual map of the teenagers’ understandings of these technologies. We go on to propose five general recommendations for the teaching of AI/ML to teenagers through the lens of Computational Empowerment. Taken together, these recommendations serve as a teenage-centered starting point for teaching young people about intelligent technologies, an approach that can be implemented in future research interventions with similar objectives.},

These trajectories consist of edit-level program snapshots that capture learners' problem-solving processes in a navigational microworld. Our results highlight the potential of this fine-grained data capture. Snapshot frequencies in trajectories collected before and after a coding intervention showcase the collective progress of the learners. Graph visualizations, in which nodes represent snapshots and directed edges code edits, highlight strategies, pitfalls and debugging procedures. Individual programming trajectories shed light on details of learners' problem-solving processes that less granular analysis would conceal. Various works in the field of Learning Analytics research show the usefulness of collecting fine-grained process data that proceed from programming activities. However, how to analyze this data is still an open question and research on the subject is in an experimental phase. We contribute to this experimentation by analyzing and discussing results collected from 30 first-grade students in a pretest-posttest study.},

The primary participants in this initiative were educators and students from two private programming institutions. Students engaged in a simulated school experience that leveraged Minecraft's command and Redstone based programming functionalities. Furthermore, the collaborative nature of the metaverse enhanced students' programming and computational thinking abilities. This poster will first delineate the distinctive features of Minecraft's programming environment in contrast to visual programming platforms such as Scratch. Subsequently, we will analyze students' experiences within the metaverse, focusing on peer interaction and the enhancement of motivation towards programming. Finally, we will conduct an evaluation and propose directions for future research.},

Programming concepts are introduced as incremental steps needed to solve pragmatic problems students already understand. The problems, graphical API, and hands-on program features are intended to expose fundamental concepts in mathematics and quantitative science.MPCT is offered in an entering students program for freshmen who plan to specialize in a variety of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and non-STEM subjects. The curriculum is intended to strengthen student intuition and interest in mathematical modeling and programming by engaging students in the direct manipulation of simple mathematical systems that model and display familiar physical phenomena. MPCT uses programs as concrete and manipulatable examples of fundamental concepts to engage a diverse range of students including women and underrepresented minorities.Variants of MPCT are being developed for high schools, and as a means to introduce computational science to upper division undergraduates studying non-computational STEM disciplines. This paper provides an overview of MPCT and representative problem studies including models of ballistics and resonant systems. The evaluation plan is described and very preliminary results are presented.},

Developing students’ CT skills may not only advance their digital literacy but it may deepen subject specific learning as well. It is therefore interesting to investigate the learning of CT from a multidisciplinary perspective. This study describes the design of a CT integrated lesson for economics in which computer models in spreadsheets are used to simulate monetary policy. The lesson is structured according to the Use-Modify-Create strategy. The aim of this exploratory study is to evaluate the learning outcomes of this CT integrated lesson and students’ attitudes towards such a lesson. For this purpose, students’ exit tickets, feedback forms, supervisor observations and interviews with students have been analyzed. This qualitative analysis revealed that students perceived the lesson as difficult, especially during the Modify and Create phases. In addition, the results suggest that all phases are dependent on taking enough time to finish the Use phase to get familiar with the computational steps. Several suggestions have been given to improve the lesson, for instance, to use a simpler topic of economics. Furthermore, the analysis of students’ attitudes revealed that connections to CT could be made more explicit rather than implicitly embedded in the instructional strategy.},

abstract = {A research-practice partnership (RPP) used a teacher co-design process, supported by equity-focused professional development, to create an elementary-level curriculum that integrates content, practices, and learning progressions from state computing standards with other standards-based curricula. Most district students are part of historically marginalized groups and the RPP chose to develop an equity and inclusion-focused curriculum that would be taught in all elementary classrooms to all students. Twelve teacher teams, supported by researchers and ELL and SPED specialists, designed, piloted, and documented 23 modules of 4-8, 45-minute lessons across K-5. Early adopter teachers followed the pilots and implemented the modules in their classrooms with the goal of facilitating adoption by all elementary classroom teachers. After being interrupted by the pandemic, the RPP developed a strategy where principals in cohorts of schools agreed to collaborate with RPP school-based lead teachers to establish professional learning communities (PLCs) to support classroom implementation of the modules. Eleven schools participated in a 2021-22 cohort and nine more schools joined in 2022-23. Centering equity, PLCs, and quality module documentation and materials are key to sustaining and evolving the CSforAll curriculum. The modules were revised based on feedback obtained from ELL and SPED specialists, early adopters, teacher coordinators, researchers, and district curriculum directors. Using a large data set of meeting and classroom observation records, interviews, field notes, focus groups, surveys, and module documentation, we track the evolution of the curriculum and provide a detailed analysis of one module as an example.},

abstract = {How to measure students' Computational Problem-Solving (CPS) competencies is an ongoing research topic. Prevalent approaches vary by measurement tools (e.g., interactive programming, multiple-choice tests, or programming-independent tests) and task types (e.g., debugging problems or Parson problems). However, few studies have examined the measurement tools of CPS competencies themselves: affordances and limitations of the measurement tools and how they compare, or whether different task types might elicit CPS competencies differently. Research needs to address these questions in order to better understand how to design robust, generalizable, and effective measurement tools for CPS competencies. This paper presents an exploratory study that contributes to this research direction. It is part of a larger international project to develop an open-access formative assessment platform for CPS, which includes a novel authoring tool for a wide range of task types for interactive block-based programming. We used the tool to create an interactive programming experience with multiple task types and gave it to more than 300 secondary school students from different countries. We also administered a validated multiple-choice measurement of Computational Thinking with block-based programs. We focused on task complexity as a characteristic of task type, using a classification scheme based on task design features. Comparing students' performances on tasks of different complexity and using two distinct measurement tools, we found that the multiple-choice measurement only partially predicts performance in the interactive programming task. Additionally, its predictive capacity varies significantly between task types of differing complexity.},

abstract = {In the 1960s, Papert and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed Turtle Graphics using the LOGO programming language. Underpinning this development was a profound new philosophy of how learning happens with computers: a microworlds-based approach to learning. The wider aim of this research project is to examine how a microworlds-based approach may be revived in contemporary educational contexts by secondary school teachers in cross-curricular subject areas. It examines the microworld as a tool for secondary level learning at ages eleven-to-fourteen and explores its potential role in making relevant conceptual learning accessible through practical, constructionist approaches in cross-curricular applications.This particular work-in-progress paper reports on a comparative evaluation of a microworlds-based approach to teaching poetic verse in the subject domain of drama. A quasi-experimental design was used in order to measure performance gains in specific aspects of computational thinking and literacy development following the microworld-based intervention. Preliminary data reveals a higher improvement in performance but further qualitative data needs to be collected in order to provide further insight to support the quantitative findings.},

abstract = {Few would argue that modern careers across a wide range of disciplines can be performed in the absence of computing in one form or another. As such, it is becoming increasingly important for our education system to appropriately prepare students for the modern world by integrating computing and computational thinking into how students learn disciplinary content (i.e. disciplines outside of computer science). However, how to best perform this integration is not yet known, nor is there likely to be one ''best'' method. In this session, we will facilitate a discussion of the variety of ways in which post-secondary institutions are actively using computing to support disciplinary learning by highlighting examples while also considering mechanisms not yet explored. We invite anyone who wants to learn more about current efforts, share their own experiences, and contribute ideas for future endeavors. In an effort to maximize the diversity of perspectives in this discussion, we've included discussion leaders who span a variety of roles within curriculum development and classroom instruction and encourage participants from all levels and backgrounds.},

abstract = {Code tracing (or program sketching) is a useful technique for both students and professionals to understand syntactic and semantic details of code. Emphasizing and exploring this skill leads students to a deep understanding of their code in the short term and ultimately, their evolution into competent programmers in the future. In this paper, we provide evidence that a careful incorporation of the concept of scoping into code tracing techniques is fundamental to achieving this successful student transition. To this end, we present a formalized pencil-and-paper code tracing strategy for CS1 called Visualized Scope Tracing (VST), with scoping as a key underlying theme that elegantly addresses code blocks, function stacks, recursive structures, pass-by-reference, arrays, pointers, and parallel code.Furthermore, we study the impact of our code tracing approach on CS1 students at a small liberal arts institution over a 10-year period. The goals of this work are twofold: describe how to easily (and naturally) integrate VST into any CS1 curricula; second, show demonstrable improvements on student learning using our technique. Our findings suggest that VST has a positive, long-lasting impact on their academic performance in CS2.},

These skills include problem formulation, logically organizing data, automating solutions through algorithmic thinking, and representing data through abstraction. One aim of the NSF is to integrate these and other computational thinking concepts into the classroom. This paper introduces a tool called the Simulation Creation Toolkit wherein users apply high-level agent interactions called Computational Thinking Patterns (CTPs) to create simulations. Programming at the Computational Thinking Pattern level allows users to directly create agent interactions in a simulation by employing generic icons acting out a scientific phenomenon they are trying to represent. The Simulation Creation Toolkit aims to preserve the computational thinking benefits of simulation creation while enabling higher-level implementation of agent behaviors. Initial study data collected from sixth grade students with no prior programming experience indicates that students can work the mechanics necessary to create simulations in the classroom environment using the Simulation Creation Toolkit.},

abstract = {Future school science standards, such as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), emphasize the integration of simulation and modeling activities in the classroom environment. The extremes of these activities have two vastly different implementations. On one hand, a teacher can have students experiment on a pre-made simulation associated with the material. On the other hand, students can use, for example, an end-user programming tool to create the simulation from scratch. This allows students to not only experiment on, but also, to model the real world phenomenon being studied- a key component of computational thinking. However, the greater amount of time necessary for student authoring of simulations can make such an approach infeasible in the classroom environment. This paper presents a spectrum of strategies for integrating simulations into class- rooms emphasizing our research at the Scalable Game Design Lab, University of Colorado Boulder as well as research from other entities. Starting at consuming simulations and adding more user interaction and authoring elements begins to provide a gentle slope from consumption towards simulation creation. Results indicate that many of these strategies are quite effective.},

abstract = {The STEM Career Infographic Project (SCIP) was a 4-week exploratory project deployed in an 8th grade classroom at Mountain Vista Middle School (MVMS). SCIP was poised to address the growing focus on STEM fields at MVMS and within the school district. We piloted SCIP in Spring 2014 with six science classes or about 180 students. SCIP allowed for students to explore their own STEM interests, while simultaneously engaging in the 6 Computational Thinking Practices (CTP) outlined by the College Board.Students were required to research a STEM career in-depth, then report on their careers using infographics (CTP #2: Creating Computational Artifacts and CTP #3: Abstracting). We used free and online programs to create the infographics; this provided the students the opportunity to learn software they were not previously exposed to and to explore new communication tools (CTP #1: Connecting Computing and CTP #2: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts). SCIP also provided many occasions for the students to work together by sharing career information or helping each other with the software (CTP #6: Collaborating). At the end of the project the students presented their infographics in front of the class and taught their classmates about their career (CTP #5: Communicating).The project was incredibly successful. The students had a positive affect through the duration of the project and many also expressed an extreme level of interest in doing similar projects in the future. We will be repeating this project in Spring 2015, with a few adaptations and formal evaluation scheme.},

abstract = {There is both great hope and concern about the future of Computer Science practice and education concerning the recent advent of large language models (LLMs).We present the first study to extensively evaluate the ability of such a model to solve problems in Computer Science Theory. Specifically, we tested 165 exam-level problems across 16 specific topics related to computer science theory, ranging from preliminary data structures to algorithm design paradigms to theory of computation (automata and complexity). Our results use the recent popular models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o). This is a rapidly evolving field, with model performance continuously improving. We present our results primarily as an indication of what they can already achieve-equivalently how they can already be useful-today, fully expecting them to improve even further in the near future. Our results show that what was very recently a state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) can solve 77% of free-response problems in data structures and algorithms with little to no guidance. The latest model, GPT-4o, can solve around 46% of the Theory of Computation problems we posed, with predictable categories for which problems it could not solve. When broken down by topic, the model can solve 80% of problems in 4 out of the 15 topics and at least half in 8 other topics. Other problems, namely more visual problems, either require more substantial coaching or seem to still be beyond the capabilities of the language model--for now. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these models for solving theory problems, we can open the door to future work, ranging from human educational assessment on the topic to automated tutors for learners of the subject.},

We briefly describe the context for the performance assessment (game-programming courses), the aspects of CT that are measured, the results, and the factors that are associated with performance. We see the development of assessment tools as a critical step in efforts to bring CT to K-12, and to strengthen the use of game programming in middle school. We discuss problems and implications of our results.},

abstract = {Decomposition is a foundational computational thinking construct that is often introduced early as students are learning computer science in the elementary grades. Although decomposition is often described in early computational activities, little research exists about how to teach and assess students’ understanding of decomposition. In this mixed-methods research study, 173 third-grade students from eight elementary school classrooms in the Midwest were taught eight lessons that integrated decomposition as well as other computational thinking practices into their mathematics instruction. They completed a computational thinking assessment after the first four lessons and again after the second four lessons. Analyses included the distribution of correct decomposition item responses, confirmatory factor analysis, and item-level error analysis. Results indicate wide variability in students’ performance on the decomposition assessment items as well as in performance on items contextualized within mathematics. This study highlights the need for additional considerations about assessing computational understanding, implications for assessment within integrated contexts, and the use of paper-and-pencil tests compared to embedded assessments.},

We report the identified opportunities and challenges based on interviews, surveys, and a theme discussion with experienced teachers from the 13 schools. The main takeaways are: First, the teachers did not perceive Technology Comprehension as a distinguished discipline, which calls for more research on how Making is scaled into a national discipline. Second, Technology Comprehension opens up for interdisciplinary and engaging learning activities, but teachers need scaffolding and support to actualise these opportunities. Third, Technology Comprehension challenges teachers' existing competencies in relation to the discipline and students' prerequisites and needs. Teachers need pedagogical means to take the societal aspect into account within the discipline. Finally, we argue for further research on supporting teachers when scaling Technology Comprehension on a national level.},

abstract = {Computational thinking is an essential skill for everyone in today's world. It is a problem solving skill that incorporates problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, logical and algorithmic thinking. Yet the exposure of students in K-12 curriculum to computational thinking is minimal in most schools. There are various opportunities for computational thinking to be included in almost all content areas in the curriculum. In order for this to be realized, teachers need introduction to the concept of computational thinking and they need to be equipped with tools to provide practices in this concept in the classrooms. Inspired by this idea, we organized a workshop in June 2014 to involve all teachers from all grade levels and all disciplines where we introduced them to the concept of computational thinking and taught them tools such as Scratch, Google Sites, HTML, and AppInventor. The workshop attracted 34 teachers mostly from the Muscogee County School District in Georgia. In this poster we present our recruitment strategy, methodology of our workshop, and results from our pre and post surveys. In particular, we present the influence of our workshop on teachers' views of computational thinking. We also share highlights from the projects that the teachers worked on during the workshop and presented at the end.},

Participants were twenty-eight students (twenty female, eight male) randomly sampled from five different High School Biology classes. Students were given the educational task of modeling protein synthesis in NetLogo. The design was a concurrent mixed-methods study. The study was situated in a constructivist and embodied cognitive perspective. The objective of the study was to develop a taxonomy table of gestures versus elements of computational thinking. Results showed a significant difference in the distribution of gestures across five concepts of computational thinking. Students used gestures adaptively in order to learn concepts of computational thinking. The findings indicate that students benefit from participating in a learning community where gesturing is seen as an important means of engaging with computing. The taxonomy is a first step towards linking computational thinking concepts with gestures as a means of better understanding student's engagement with computing.},

abstract = {As efforts to incorporate Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) into K-12 classrooms continue to expand, there is a growing need for programs that prepare teachers for the effective teaching and integration of CS and CT into their instruction. An ongoing challenge is preparing current and future teachers to develop the skills and confidence needed to teach and integrate CS and CT. Micro-credentials, designed as a short, focused course, offer opportunities for teachers to build skills and confidence through targeted study. This experience report examines a self-paced online micro-credential developed and implemented within a university-based college of education. The micro-credential was designed to equip both pre-service and in-service teachers with the skills and knowledge necessary to teach and integrate CS and CT into K-12 teaching and learning. We describe the micro-credential, including its structure, sequencing, and content. We then present an exploration of teachers' experiences in the micro-credential. Findings from surveys and CS autobiographies show increases in participants' attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward the conceptual and technical aspects of teaching CS, with a particular focus on designing clear and actionable plans for integration. The results from this study provide valuable insights for the development of future CS- and CT-focused micro-credentials.},

This paper aims at exploring how to develop remote learning activities in technology education during a pandemic for at-risk students. We present a case study with 23 primary students (11-12 years) who we involved in online and offline learning activities about both how intelligent technologies work but also on the implications that these technologies bring to our society. Our findings showed potential challenges to engage at-risk students in the agenda of Computational Empowerment. We propose three recommendations and future directions to scaffold at-risk students’ learning about intelligent technologies in remote contexts: (1) support the development of agency through the engagement of contexts-for-action; (2) reduce the complexity of remote communication through creative and bodily engagement; (3) reflect upon forces that marginalize oneself in a digitized society.},

Here we describe a case study of two students, Charlie and Aaron who participated in the unit. Comparing pre- and post- interviews in which they were asked to design a program for a hypothetical simulation of evolution, we found that both students shifted from an event-based programming approach to a rule-based approach. Both students also drew upon their experience with Frog Pond to explain an evolutionary phenomenon. However, the level of sophistication of the two students' explanations varied along with the aspects of Frog Pond they drew upon. These findings have implications for design improvement to better support students' understanding of evolution.},

Traditional programming environments for children focus on concrete programming language syntax and semantics yet often fall short in conveying advanced computational concepts. To address this gap, 3CPEs combine the hands-on appeal of computer-science unplugged activities with the versatility of programming environments, using familiar objects and gamified elements to visualize abstract computational and algorithmic ideas. An example is CT (Computational Thinking) Chef, a 3CPEs implementation to enhance elementary students’ understanding of programming concepts. Through design workshops with five elementary programming teachers, we preliminarily identified teaching challenges and evaluated 3CPEs’ efficacy as an educational tool. The feedback underscores CT Chef’s potential in facilitating the teaching of intricate computational concepts for young learners.},

abstract = {The goal of the DISSECT program is to integrate computational thinking lessons into general education K-12 classrooms via graduate student/teacher partnerships. The idea of combining the teaching of CT with other disciplines is not new and it has taken shape in a variety of recent efforts in the formal education of youth. What is promising and innovative is the approach as it is implemented in K12 DISSECT classrooms. Through a collaborative teaching partnership, teachers gain a new perspective regarding computer science, and in cooperation with graduate students well-versed in computer science concepts, develop lessons and course modules that serve two purposes: 1.) Address K-12 content standards in core disciplines (e.g., language arts, life science) and 2.) Introduce CT concepts, such as abstraction, algorithms, data analysis and modeling. This poster describes ways computational thinking (CT) is taught in general K-12 classrooms in New Mexico through cooperative teaching. Along with their potential to stimulate interest in computing, these pilot modules were viewed by K12 teachers as enhancing disciplinary course content that teachers are charged with teaching (e.g., middle school science, language arts), deemed vital for sustainability in K12 schools by participating teachers. Preliminary data indicate graduate student and teacher satisfaction with cooperative teaching of CT. Next steps for research will involve student level data collection and analysis.},

This study proposes a progressive scaffolding approach with flowcharts and visual programming codes applied to a visual programming course based on an open-source hardware platform to improve CT skills and self-efficacy in middle school students. Forty-five middle school students in grades 7 and 8 participated in this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected by using CT tests, scales, and semi-structured interviews. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) examined differences in CT skills and self-efficacy on the pre-test, mid-test, and post-test. The results indicated that the progressive scaffolding approach significantly improved middle school students’ CT skills and self-efficacy. These results reveal the effectiveness of the progressive scaffolding approach in improving the computational thinking of middle school students in a visual programming course with an open-source hardware platform, which helps to extend the design of progressive scaffolding.},

Such a challenge may tie to socio-cultural issues that have impacted K-12 CS education, eventually creating a gender gap in CS performance and attitudes. The current study compared American and Indonesian middle school students' computational thinking (CT) skills and CS attitudes. Concurrently, this study also examined whether the items in the instruments we used exhibit country, gender, or prior CS experience measurement biases. A total of 592 American n = 242 and Indonesian n = 350 middle school students took a CT assessment and CS attitudes scale. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to detect biased items, and a two-way ANOVA was utilized to examine the interaction effects of country and gender in the two constructs. The results showed some items were flagged as having country-specific DIF. The results also indicated that the American students had higher CT scores than Indonesian students. However, Indonesian students obtained higher CS attitudes scores compared to American students. Further results showed a significant gender difference in CS attitudes in the American samples; however, such a significant difference was not found in the Indonesian sample. These findings underscore the importance of a country's socio-cultural context in influencing gender diversity in the CS field.},

Our findings suggest that digital design literacy supports children's agency and empowerment in relation to digital technology. Moreover, digital design literacy provides children with four broad competence areas of effective teamwork, contextual inquiry, imagination and creation, and design process navigation. Our study also demonstrates that digital design literacy does not fit seamlessly within the path of conventional school courses. Several structural barriers in formal education such as summative assessments, teacher-roles, failure-prevention and children's lack of experiences with open-ended assignments are reported and discussed in relation to previous studies in child-computer interaction research.},

Modern tools aimed at novice programmers should empower their users to create games, such as Pac-Man, that approach or even exceed the gameplay of 1980's arcade games. By adding a high-level AI pathfinding block to the RULER.game tool, 13 students in grades 1-4 attempted to build Pac-Man-like games. The findings suggest that all students were able to create Pac-Man-like games with compelling gameplay interactions, including ghosts finding the shortest path through complex mazes to Pac-Man, multiple ghosts collaborating with each other, and sophisticated game world topologies featuring toroidal portals.},

Using an existing framework outlining functional, educational, democratic, mainstream, and critical empowerment, our analysis shows that while empowerment is rarely defined in CCI papers, a wide range of different articulations coexists. We explore the prevalence of different articulations in the literature and how this has shifted over time. We show that although empowerment has been part of the CCI discourse since the early days, a shift can be noticed in terms of how empowerment is articulated from an emphasis on empowerment in its functional meaning towards a more even distribution and the advent of critical articulations of empowerment. We conclude the paper by looking ahead into a new decade of CCI research and posing three questions to assist CCI researchers in more clearly articulating the nature and understanding of empowerment.},

abstract = {This SIGCSE poster presents a landscape study of six school districts across six different states in terms of their individual teachers' and administrators' capacity to integrate and implement computational thinking (CT) into their own schools and classrooms. This landscape evaluation represents the baseline start of a wider, four-year national study around district capacity to collaboratively develop consistent and comprehensive K-12 computing pathways for their students and schools. The early landscape work we present here not only represents a starting point for comparing district educators' comprehension of CT (and computer science [CS]), but also acts as an early indicator as to what extent K-12 computing is a school and district-based priority, and to what degree teachers feel they have the capacity to meaningfully implement it. This poster relies on two data sources in a mixed-methods design: Districtwide surveys of teachers and administrators on their familiarity and prioritization of CT, coupled with subsequent hour-long focus group discussions with educators to expand upon their respective district landscape survey responses. Results point to all districts perceiving the broad applicability of CT as a skill set and its integrative potential in a range of subjects. Yet in terms of classroom implementation, teachers find such CT integration decidedly less clear, recognizing it to be a priority but also reporting as less confident about creating their own curricular materials, where CT situates with their district's ongoing initiatives, and where they can find curricular resources and tools specific to their own areas of curricular integration.},

abstract = {Like digital technologies themselves, programming education is embedded in the colonial matrix of power, and access to programming knowledge demands immersion in the epistemologies of the Global North. While there is a growing body of work exploring ways to decolonise programming education, far more needs to be done. Current research focuses on the language of instruction and contextual curricula; outward-facing engagements with decolonisation. However, to move towards digital-decoloniality involves scrutinising how programming knowledge is recontextualised within curricula. Part of the project should be equipping both educators and students with the tools to recontextualise programming itself. To dismantle the colonial logic embedded in programming education, attention must be given to the knowledge formation of the discipline to identify moments of disruption. One such moment is the difficulty students face when recontextualising their mental models of computing, from programming skills to programming concepts. This occurs at the moment of reading, tracing and writing code. Programming requires one to refocus computational thinking and engage with a specific semiotic system, translating the authors’ intention into an executable computational process. Disrupting this moment using the strategies of critical literacies opens computer programming and its resulting code to critical examination, allowing an inward-facing decolonial engagement with the discipline.},

abstract = {As reliance on technology increases in practically every aspect of life, all students deserve the opportunity to learn to think computationally from early in their educational experience. To support the kinds of computer science curriculum and instruction that makes this possible, there is an urgent need to develop and validate computational thinking (CT) assessments for elementary-aged students. We developed the Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students (ACES) to measure the CT concepts of loops and sequences for students in grades 3-5. The ACES includes block-based coding questions as well as non-programming, Bebras-style questions. We conducted cognitive interviews to understand student perspectives while taking the ACES. We piloted the assessment with 57 4th grade students who had completed a CT curriculum. Preliminary analyses indicate acceptable reliability and appropriate difficulty and discrimination among assessment items. The significance of this paper is to present a new CT measure for upper elementary students and to share its intentional development process.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) and related concepts, as programming and algorithmic thinking, have been recently advocated as abilities that are as fundamental as numeracy and literacy, and many countries all over the world are introducing programming activities in education. In Italy, even if the introduction of CT and programming in schools is on the pipeline of policy makers, they have not yet been included in the curriculum guidelines. Consequently, there is a strong case for analyzing how programming can be integrated at early stages into the Italian compulsory education. Starting from the constructivist tradition, a study spanning over several school years has been organized aiming at defining and testing a programming learning path for primary schools. The learning path takes into account children's interests, stimulating their passions and creativity. Students are engaged on projects that are meaningful for them, while teachers take advantage of the situations that spontaneously arise to guide students' attention on specific computational concepts. The learning path is being iteratively refined through a field experiment involving a primary school over a four year period. The study aims to the following questions:• Under which conditions can age-appropriate programming activities, allowing for individual differences in learning styles and approaches, work in primary school?• Which indications can the work performed provide to the sustainability of the programming activities when the researchers' support will come to an end?• Which elements of the study can provide suggestions for a wider introduction of programming in primary schools?Since the study is currently in its third year, this paper addresses the first two research question, while only some initial considerations are provided for the third one.},

This enthusiasm for CS is driven, in part, by the belief that through CS instruction, students will learn computational thinking (CT) skills, which can also be applied to domains outside CS. We add to this literature by examining whether or not there is a relationship between receiving CS instruction and students' academic performance in non-CS subject areas. Using a fixed-effects regression methodology with course-taking records from New York City, we examine the association between CS instruction and course grades for high school students. We find small positive associations between CS instruction and end-of-year grades in English, Math, Science, and Social Studies.},

abstract = {The search for alternative teaching–learning processes that attract more interest and involvement of young people has inspired the development of a game with a chatbot architecture based on interactive storytelling and multiple learning paths. Thus, we introduce in this article the GameBot ZoAm, developed for the Discord instant messaging and social platform. ZoAm offers a unique learning experience centered around storytelling, focusing on fundamental computing concepts and logical challenges that enhance computational thinking skills. Furthermore, the game also promotes an appreciation for Amazonian culture and folklore, with decision-making with human values. An action research study was conducted involving students from the last years of the end of elementary school. The research utilized a heuristic analysis based on the Gameplay Heuristics (PLAY) by Desurvire and Wiberg (ANO) and the evaluation model proposed by Korhonen and Koivisto (ANO) for mobile devices. The analysis employed a reduced and merged set of heuristics from these models, suited for the GameBot's context, focusing on (I) usability, (II) gameplay and immersion, and (III) mobility. Regarding the reliability coefficient used to evaluate the survey applied to students after playing the GameBot, Cronbach's Alpha and Guttman Lambda-6 (G6(smc)) coefficients were applied. These metrics were chosen to ensure the internal consistency and reliability of survey items, reflecting on how effectively the questions measured the focuses proposed by the heuristic analysis. The findings indicate that the game has the potential to facilitate the assimilation of the integrated concepts and sustain student interest throughout gameplay.},

abstract = {The purpose of this poster presentation is to demonstrate how we can bring art into computational thinking and computer programming spaces. Op-Artist Bridget Riley used geometrical shapes and patterns to express motion across the canvas. The example of Bridget Riley's art inspired U.S. middle and high school students to express their own artistic motions in unplugged and computer coded learning activities.This interdisciplinary lesson began with introducing Bridget Riley's artwork and how she arranged different triangles to create the illusion of movement [1]. Students then recreated one of her works by drawing triangles on graph paper with pencils, mimicking Riley's black-and-white compositions. After this unplugged activity, students transferred this understanding of drawing different triangles to the computer using JavaScript. Students used the gridlines behind their drawn triangles to map the pixel coordinates on a computer screen. Students used commands such as fill to set the color of the triangles and p5js.com's built-in triangle command to draw the triangles by specifying the (x, y) coordinates of each of the three vertices on the computer screen. Students then customized and expanded their code to express their interests (e.g., by picking different colors or effects) and to make it interactive for the user (e.g., by having the triangles' top vertices move left and right with the cursor of the screen). By the end of the lesson, each student created different works of Bridget Riley inspired art through their written code.},

In this paper, we present the curriculum design, implementation, and results from a one-trimester introductory Python course that is mandatory for all 8th graders in our school district. This course is a crucial component of the K-12 computational thinking pathways we are developing at our school district, which take students from block-based programming and computational thinking (elementary school) to text-based programming and applications of computer science (high school). Our mandatory 8th grade course serves as a bridge between these two components. We present qualitative results that highlight the challenges that arose from teaching a course for all students -- not just those with a prior interest in computing -- and how the instructor overcame those challenges. We also present quantitative results that demonstrate the course's positive impact on students' attitudes towards computer science, their intent to re-engage with computer science in the future, and the gender gap with regards to confidence in computer science.},

abstract = {As computer science is integrated into a wider variety of fields, block-based programming languages like Snap!, which assemble code with visual blocks rather than text syntax, are increasingly used to teach computational thinking (CT) to students from diverse backgrounds. Although automated evaluators (autograders) for programming assignments usually focus on runtime efficiency and output accuracy, effective evaluation of a student's CT skills requires assessing coding best practices, such as decomposition, abstraction, and algorithm design. While autograders are commonplace for text languages like Python, we present a machine learning approach to assess how effectively block-based code demonstrates understanding of CT fundamentals. Our dataset consists of Snap! programs written by students new to coding and evaluated by instructors using a CT rubric. We explore how to best transform these programs into low-dimensional features to allow encapsulation and repetition patterns to emerge. Experimentation involves comparing the effectiveness of a suite of clustering models and similarity metrics by analyzing how directly automated feedback correlates to the course staff's manual evaluation. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical application of the autograder in a classroom setting and discuss scalability and feasibility in other domains of CS education.},

abstract = {In 1962, Thomas Kuhn changed our understanding of scientific progress through his explanation of scientific paradigms and attribution of scientific advances to paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn, a discipline's paradigm drives research, provides explanations, and directs the accumulation of discipline-specific knowledge. In 2006 and 2008 Jeanette Wing authored articles that reignited interest in computational thinking (CT) education and CT education research. Wing's articles, arguably, set in place the conceptual foundations of the paradigm currently guiding CT education and paved the way for a fruitful decade of CT education research. We are concerned, however, that the present direction of CT education and research will not support CT as an integral part of K-12 education. In its current form, CT instruction focuses almost exclusively on teaching students to program and isolates CT from disciplinary content; perpetuating the persistent misconception that programming = CT. This approach to CT education may deprive students of the opportunity to adequately develop foundational CT skills (e.g. systems thinking, abstraction and generalization, data collection and utilization, solution evaluation) and may prevent teachers from persistently and meaningfully integrating CT into their curriculum. Through this talk, we identify features of the current CT paradigm, question their alignment with Wing's ideal of "computational thinking for everyone," and propose specific recommendations for expanding the current CT paradigm.},

abstract = {Objectives. Computer Science (CS) education has become increasingly prevalent in elementary schools because of multiple rationales, such as the importance of computational literacy and the growing demand for CS-related workforce preparation. As elementary CS standards continue to be adopted by many states, more examples and voices from the field may help educators understand what effective computational thinking (CT)/CS integration looks like in practice. Method. We employed a descriptive qualitative approach to study eight award-winning K-8 CS teachers and aimed to answer three research questions: (1) What were elementary CS teachers’ rationales for CT/CS integration? (2) How do elementary CS teachers integrate CT/CS into their classroom practices? (3) What are the needs of CS teachers for meaningful CT/CS integration in elementary schools? Data were collected through interviews, a questionnaire, and artifacts and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings. Our findings of elementary CS teachers’ rationales for CT/CS integration encompassed its essential nature as a literacy skill, its potential to promote equity in education, and its alignment with standards across various disciplines. To support CT/CS integration at the elementary level, CS teachers described important aspects with examples from their instructional practices: (a) Real-world applications; (b) hands-on activities; (c) strategies to scaffold and guide student learning; (d) collaboration with classroom teachers; and (e) support from professional development (PD). Conclusion. The study results shared CS teachers’ voices from practice and shed light on the urgent need for more support and PD opportunities for both homeroom teachers and CS teachers in elementary schools, as well as the crucial need for multiple levels of support within K-12 school systems. Continuous efforts in creating systematic and sustainable PD plans and supporting collaborative professional communities for teachers within the instructional context are a must to help prepare our elementary students with the essential CS knowledge and skills they need to thrive in this technology-rich society.},

We deliberately avoid the use of technology and, in particular, programming, and we focus on games, such as tossing a coin to see who goes first and playing Tic-Tac-Toe. We report on middle-school students' understanding of basic CS concepts and their experiences with the curriculum.After piloting the curriculum in 6th and 7th grade electives, we found that students liked the curriculum and using games, while some other students reported struggling with the technical content in the algorithm unit and vocabulary across the curriculum. Overall, students gained an understanding of abstraction and representation, and most students could define an algorithm and recognize a condition. However, they could not correctly organize the instructions of an algorithm. Our results suggest that the non-coding, game-based curriculum engaged middle school students in basic CS concepts at the middle school level, but we believe there is room for improvement in delivering technical content and vocabulary related to algorithms.},

In this application, children will write a simple program to color the 'pixels' of an image. Through the game application, they will learn programming commands, sequencing and debugging. This educational application was built using prevailing research on child centered design knowledge regarding child user interface and experience and aims to help scale initiatives dedicated towards introducing children to computer science at an early age.},

abstract = {While the Next Generation Science Standards set an expectation for developing computer science and computational thinking (CT) practices in the context of science subjects, it is an open question as to how to create curriculum and assessments that develop and measure these practices. In this poster, we show one possible solution to this problem: to introduce students to computer science through infusing computational thinking practices ("CT-ifying") science classrooms. To address this gap, our group has worked to explicitly characterize core CT-STEM practices as specific learning objectives and we use these to guide our development of science curriculum and assessments. However, having these learning objectives in mind is not enough to actually create activities that engage students in CT practices. We have developed along with science teachers, a strategy of examining a teacher's existing curricula and identifying potential activities and concepts to "CT-ify", rather than creating entirely new curricula from scratch by using the concept of scale as an "attack vector'' to design science units that integrate computational thinking practices into traditional science curricula. We demonstrate how we conceptualize four different versions of scale in science, 1. Time, 2. Size, 3. Number, and 4. Repeatability. We also present examples of these concepts in traditional high school science curricula that hundreds of students in a large urban US school district have used.},

We contribute with studies of design partnering in three different PD activities: Field studies, Ideation, and Prototyping. We map out the opportunities and challenges we faced in our study when applying design partnering in PD research.

A study with over 10,000 students is exploring the sustainability of this approach and finding positive responses to inquiries such as these: Do teachers continue to use game design?

This study examined the influence of integrating CT into assistive technology course for special education pre-service teachers.

abstract = {Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures. We measured students’ perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task. We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment.},

abstract = {Integrated computing curricula combine learning objectives in computing with those in another discipline, like literacy, math, or science, to give all students experience with computing, typically before they must decide whether to take standalone CS courses. One goal of integrated computing curricula is to provide an accessible path to an introductory computing course by introducing computing concepts and practices in required courses. This study analyzed integrated computing curricula to determine which CS practices and concepts are taught, how extensively the curricula are taught, and, by extension, how they might prepare students for later computing courses. The authors conducted a content analysis to examine primary and lower secondary (i.e., K-8) curricula that are taught in non-CS classrooms, have explicit CS learning objectives (i.e., CS+X), and that took 5+ hours to complete. Lesson plans, descriptions, and resources were scored based on frameworks developed from the K-12 CS Framework, including programming concepts, non-programming CS concepts, and CS practices. The results found that curricula most extensively taught introductory concepts and practices, such as sequences, and rarely taught more advanced content, such as conditionals. Students who engage with most of these curricula would have no experience working with fundamental concepts, like variables, operators, data collection or storage, or abstraction in the context of a program. While this focus might be appropriate for integrated curricula, it has implications for the prior knowledge that students should be expected to have when starting standalone computing courses.},

abstract = {Computer scientists have been working towards a common definition of abstraction; however, the instruction and assessment of abstraction remain categorically under-researched. Abstraction is often cited as a component of computational thinking and can be likened to a higher order thinking skill. Most K-12 educators have studied critical thinking (e.g., Bloom's taxonomy, Marzano &amp; Kendall's new taxonomy) more than computational thinking. Overlapping characteristics of abstraction and critical thinking can provide educators with instructional guidance. The qualitative examination of how teachers determine curriculum, deliver instruction, and design assessments in K-12 computer science education contributes insights into current instructional practices and variables for future quantitative study. The instructional strategies, objectives, and assessments of 12 K-12 computer science teachers from three states in the United States were examined in this descriptive qualitative examination of instruction using thematic coding analysis. The majority of teachers interviewed had little to no professional development regarding teaching abstraction. All teachers in the study were unsure what student abstraction abilities should be according to grade level. Teachers' understanding of abstraction ranged from very little knowledge to very knowledgeable. The majority of teachers interviewed did not assess abstraction intentionally. Teachers described successfully teaching abstraction through multiple instructional practices and spiraling curriculum. This examination of abstraction in K-12 computer science education offers practical descriptive insights and illuminates additional variables for researching the instruction of abstraction qualitatively and quantitatively. Anecdotal instructional successes are included in the results.},

abstract = {There has been a worldwide surge in programming education initiatives for children and teenagers. In Brazil, this trend faces some challenges, namely inadequate infrastructure of most schools, notably public ones, that lack access to computers and tablets, and basic education curricular requirements not contemplating computer science concepts. This article reports on the five-year experience of an outreach project from a public university in Brazil. The project aims to promote computer science education and to teach programming to children and teenagers. Undergraduate engineering students who participate in the project as members engage in activities such as planning the courses and their schedules, creating partnerships with local schools and other educational projects, giving lectures, producing scientific research and educational materials, as well as promoting the project on social media. The courses use free online programming tools, Python, MIT App Inventor, and Arduino to cover fundamental concepts of programming and computational thinking. They vary approaches and tools according to the age range and available technological resources of the target audience. The use of unplugged activities means to assist in learning and to circumvent computer access problems. Furthermore, they serve for introducing basic programming concepts in classes and motivating students with dynamic activities. Over its five-year existence, the project has achieved its purpose, by reaching a total of 2639 students through 45 workshops and 94 courses. It has provided courses in eleven public schools, created two booklets and one app as free educational material, along with presented papers and posters in scientific conferences.},

Objects in early childhood environments often share space between adults’ and children's objectives. By considering these objects as boundary objects, designers are led to explore how children appropriate objects for playful learning activities beyond adult objectives. This paper discusses Wobblies (see Figure 1), a novel technology probe, to interrogate how a socially-motivated design with conditional and positional interactive behaviour was understandable to children, and how they appropriated the probe in playful activities. We deployed the probe in a rural Australian preschool in a free-play environment. Initial observational findings show that the children understood the procedure of the interactions and moved from exploring to constructive play activities.},

Flow focuses on the individual-- an individual is in Flow when challenges are balanced with skills. The Zone of Proximal Development, on the other hand, brings in a social learning aspect focusing on a student's ability to learn concepts with external support. From our research experiences bringing game and simulation design into middle school classrooms, we attempt to provide students with appropriate challenges using a project-first based approach that aims to keep students in Flow. The project-first approach employs inquiry based scaffolding to guide students, with appropriate support by their teachers, through Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, back in to Csikszentmihalyi's state of Flow for an ideal learning experience. We call this space the Zones of Proximal Flow. Data indicate that the Zones of Proximal Flow approach works, keeping classrooms engaged in the act of game design and enabling students to advance to more complex program creations.},

Second, insights from didactic theories from maths and computer science education about working with multiple and rich representations of complex and intangible phenomena. Based on this we contribute three principles for enriching pupils’ relationship to data in order to inform future research into how pupils can be scaffolded in forming richer relationships to the data-driven technologies in their everyday lives in order to retain agency in a data-driven world.},

Experiences in the course include hands-on activities, readings, tutorials, opportunities for reflection, assignments that require preservice teachers to teach coding to intermediate or senior students, and participation in online discussions. Research questions include 1) What course experiences or other factors affect how preservice teachers come to view coding in teaching and learning mathematics? and 2) How are these views, related to coding in teaching and learning mathematics, translated into their practice teaching?},

abstract = {Introducing digital literacy to young children develops foundational skills in problem-solving and supports their cognitive development, including critical thinking. However, physical manipulatives for digital literacy are not always designed for early-year environments or specifically for young children. Physical manipulatives can offer developmentally appropriate tools to introduce foundational digital literacy through dynamic system knowledge before children become developmentally ready for more formalised coding activities. This paper presents an initial study in a preschool environment with children (ages 3 – 5 years) using novel physical manipulatives, Embeddables (Fig. 1), in child-led free and guided play activities in a preschool. From our initial analysis of the types of activities the children engaged in, we identify how, firstly, children used the proximal relations to undertake experimental understanding of the devices, which secondly led to using the proximal relationships in their social play, further supported by the scale and feedback of the toys.},

abstract = {There is a growing need in computer science education to develop courses that demonstrate the articulations between computer science and an array of computing-dependent fields. This poster describes an effort to develop a model for students and faculty to collaborate across disciplines and with a community organization to develop computational solutions to address complex real-world problems. Students in computer science classes are collaborating with students in journalism classes and Habitat for Humanity, to develop a web-based system that manages pollution related data. This is an initiative aimed at empowering citizens in the Trenton area of New Jersey with the opportunity to learn, share, and contribute pollution data while encouraging them to become participants in environmental advocacy and public policy deliberations on these issues. While students focus on the objectives of the individual courses, they are also deeply engaged in the complexities of privacy, security, accessibility of data, user-centered design, etc. as they ponder civic justice issues.},

abstract = {Math on a Sphere (MoS) is a newly developed Web-based environment that enables children to imagine, program, and share creative designs on a public spherical display, the "Science on a Sphere" system created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The MoS software, similar in spirit to the Logo language, was installed at an exhibit located in the Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California at Berkeley and at the Fiske Planetarium at University of Colorado, Boulder. Twenty-five children ages 8 to 13 in two cohorts tested the MoS software during a half-day workshop held at the Lawrence Hall. In addition to using the MoS software to create beautiful and original works of art, children also engaged in hands-on crafts and inquiry-based math activities to further promote learning of spherical geometry and computational thinking. MoS software workshop had a positive impact on children's engagement, but had mixed results about their understanding of geometry as evidenced by direct observations and results from pre/post-surveys, which are reported here.},

abstract = {As teacher professional development efforts continue to scale to meet the growing demand for computer science educators, more individuals with little formal preparation in the discipline are seeking training. For this reason, it is important to understand the kinds of questions that these teachers, along with administrators and IT staff, are asking professional development providers. This research examines questions received by Scalable Game Design (SGD), a project that engages students in computing through game and simulation design activities. SGD has provided training for more than 300 teachers since 2009. We have found several dimensions of interest in the question pool. The major categories of questions received are pedagogical, technical, and procedural, and we present a generalizable taxonomy of question types plus specific examples. In addition, question content and questioner roles fluctuate throughout the professional development and classroom implementation cycle, from initial inquiries to requests regarding next steps. Knowledge of these factors can lead to adjustments in training content to reduce questions later on and potentially increase teacher confidence; moreover, this information can inform planning for support resources, an especially important activity when project growth is forecast. We also discuss how our support structures have changed over the life of the project and compare them to two other curriculum initiatives that rely on unique software environments. Our future work will investigate the characteristics of teachers who are asking particular kinds of questions, including their disciplinary backgrounds, experience in the classroom, familiarity with SGD, and instructional environments.},

abstract = {The association between mathematics and programming in an educational context is not new. Today, programming has been introduced into curricula worldwide for younger children. In the Swedish case, primary school teachers are expected to integrate programming in mathematics education from autumn 2018. However, Swedish teachers' knowledge of programming and programming didactics is limited. Meanwhile, there is little research on K-9 programming education. This has led to the dilemma that the mathematics teachers have limited support in didactic knowledge and good examples. This study reports on a teacher professional development project in programming. More specifically, teachers used Lesson Study to plan, execute, and evaluate lessons that integrated programming into various school subjects in elementary school. This study analyzed the didactic strategies developed in 10 lesson studies, as well as mapped the opportunities and challenges of pupils' learning in the mathematics subject. The result was the identification of three didactic strategies, which were analog programming, robot programming and block programming, as well as 11 didactic methods applied within these strategies. The paper contributes with examples of the didactic methods that teachers have developed and evaluated using lesson study. The paper further provides insights on how teachers can take progression into account by applying the three didactic strategies. At last but not least, the study shows a great need for teachers to develop computational thinking abilities.},

However, there are still many challenges within primary computing education, including the cost and availability of resources, and teachers' familiarity and/or confidence with these resources. In this paper, we offer an approach that develops a creative story-based pedagogy to address constraints such as these and facilitate the development of lesson plans supporting scaffolding and differentiation. Children's literature is used to introduce concepts such as pattern matching, abstraction and algorithms, along with the three main programming constructs of sequencing, repetition and selection. Through four stages of Read-Act-Model-Program (RAMP), we present a set of unplugged and Scratch-based activities and reflect on the potential impact of this educational opportunity to inspire an early interest in computing.},

However, there is limited research focusing on remote collaborative environments, despite the opportunity to design new modes of access and control of content to promote more equitable learning experiences. We investigated the tradeoffs between remote and co-located collaboration through a tangible coding kit. We asked ten pairs of mixed-visual ability children to collaborate in an interdependent and asymmetric coding game. We contribute insights on six dimensions - effectiveness, computational thinking, accessibility, communication, cooperation, and engagement - and reflect on differences, challenges, and advantages between collaborative settings related to communication, workspace awareness, and computational thinking training. Lastly, we discuss design opportunities of tangibles, audio, roles, and tasks to create inclusive learning activities in remote and co-located settings.},

A popular pedagogical approach for this age group is Use--&gt;Modify--&gt;Create, which introduces a concept through a more scaffolded, guided instruction before culminating in a more open-ended project for student engagement. Yet, there is little research on student learning during the Use--&gt;Modify step, nor strategies to promote learning in this step. This paper introduces TIPP&amp;SEE, a metacognitive learning strategy that further scaffolds student learning during this step. Results from an experimental study show statistically-significant performance gains from students using the TIPP&amp;SEE strategy on nearly all assessment questions of moderate and hard difficulty, suggesting its potential as an effective CS/CT learning strategy.},

abstract = {Block-based programming languages effectively address syntactic difficulties allowing users to more easily create code. Syntactic code support is no doubt a crucial step in enabling the next generation of programmers. However, in what other ways do these tools support the computational thinking (CT) process? For example, how is CT supported in both the semantic and pragmatic levels? Most users do not just want to write code?they want to create interesting artifacts such as video games, simulations, stories and robots. No doubt that users must code to build these artifacts, but just as important, though often overlooked, is that users must also have an understanding of tool affordances to effectively build these artifacts. The position presented in this paper is that the comprehension of affordances is essential to each stage of the computational thinking process. To that end, we introduce the Hourglass Challenge as a way for students to experience affordances through a programming challenge based on mis-aligned tools and problems. The results from a study, with 54 preservice elementary school teachers, indicate that the affordances of tools can have profound consequences on computational thinking. For instance, the affordances various tools provide can be the difference between creating a simulation versus an animation. But just as hammers are not intrinsically better tools than screwdrivers, the contribution of this position paper is not to compare tools, but to promote efforts that enable learners to develop a better understanding of computational thinking tool affordances as essential mediators between problems and tools.},

The program marks the first time a formal Computer Science (CS) course has been taught in an Alabama middle school. The CS4ALL-B curriculum builds upon the Auburn University innovative 'three-step' model of K-12 computing and robotics instruction that introduces CS and Computational Thinking (CT) concepts for K-12 students. This model uses programming frameworks such as Kodu, Alice, App Inventor, Lego NXT-G and Tetrix, and Computer Science Unplugged (CSU) activities. While moving between the three steps, students explore the fundamentals of CS/CT concepts. The CS4ALL-B curriculum is structured in four main sections: First, introduction to Kodu for 7th graders and Alice for 8th graders; Second, introduction to CS/CT Concepts; Third, participation in selected CSU activities, then students develop their programs to demonstrate their abilities to design and create Kodu or Alice worlds that implement the concepts learned while participating in CSU activities; Fourth, students build their own course project that includes all concepts and skills grasped throughout their training. This model helps maintain high levels of motivation, concentration, and engagement during the entire course. The results of the pilot assessment, including tools such as traditional written assessments (e.g. quizzes, tests) as well as alternative assessments tools (e.g. projects and blog posts), will be presented. We have found that our methods foster the learners' nascent development in CS.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and classroom implementation of a week-long unit that aims to integrate computational thinking (CT) into middle school science classes using programmable sensor technology. The goals of this sensor immersion unit are to help students understand why and how to use sensor and visualization technology as a powerful data-driven tool for scientific inquiry in ways that align with modern scientific practice. The sensor immersion unit is anchored in the investigation of classroom data where students engage with the sensor technology to ask questions about and design displays of the collected data. Students first generate questions about how data data displays work and then proceed through a set of programming exercises to help them understand how to collect and display data collected from their classrooms by building their own mini data displays. Throughout the unit students draw and update their hand drawn models representing their current understanding of how the data displays work. The sensor immersion unit was implemented by ten middle school science teachers during the 2019/2020 school year. Student drawn models of the classroom data displays from four of these teachers were analyzed to examine students' understandings in four areas: function of sensor components, process models of data flow, design of data displays, and control of the display. Students showed the best understanding when describing sensor components. Students exhibited greater confusion when describing the process of how data streams moved through displays and how programming controlled the data displays.},

We discuss in detail three dimensions of this social turn (1) from writing code to creating applications, (2) from composing "from scratch" to remixing the work of others, and (3) from designing tools to facilitating communities. These three shifts illustrate how the development of artifacts, tools, and communities of programming lead us to move from computational thinking to computational participation. We draw from examples of past and current research, both inside and outside of school, and situate these developments in the context of current discussions around computational thinking, which has become a driving force in revitalizing programming in K-12 curricula and altogether broadening participation in computing.},

abstract = {Academic self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards a school subject are relevant for learning and educational achievement. A positive self-concept in science and mathematics is argued to motivate students to persist and advance in studying these subjects. In particular, self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards STEM domains were found to be predictive of educational achievement. Recently, programming was suggested to be a key competence in education.To assess self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming, we developed a new questionnaire based on existing scales for mathematics. The new questionnaire assesses the same aspects for programming on seven subscales, such as self-concept, belief about usefulness, and self-reported persistence when working on programming tasks.We conducted a pilot study in which we used this questionnaire to measure self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming. The study was set in the context of an extracurricular course on computational thinking (CT) for elementary school students between the ages of seven and ten years. Before the start of the course, we assessed all 31 participating students' self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming using the developed questionnaire and their CT skills using the Computational Thinking test (CTt).Our results confirmed the expected associations between the aspects assessed by our questionnaire. However, we did not find significant associations of questionnaire results and CT skills. Consequently, future research involving a larger sample is needed to better understand the association between children's actual performance and their self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss using models and modeling in a new way to teach basic computing to pupils within the K-12 segment. We argue why we believe understanding and creating models are fundamental skills for all pupils as it can be characterized as the skill that enable us to analyze and understand phenomena as well as design and construct artifacts. We also try to characterize the essence of model-based thinking and practice. We propose that a strong focus on the relation between mental models (of real or imaginary systems) and computerized models (embedded in computer-based systems) could provide a new approach to teaching computing. This approach should clarify and make explicit the role of models in computing in connection with other subject areas. We believe that such an approach would strongly broaden the participation in computing, as it will allow more pupils to become active creators with computing.},

During a five-week pilot, a group of students spent after-school time learning the basic elements of dance and then using them to program three-dimensional characters that could perform. Throughout the pilot, we found students consistently standing up in front of their computers and using their bodies to think through the actuation of their characters. Preliminary results suggest that designing a virtual-physical dance performance is a motivating and engaging social context in which to introduce students, especially girls, to alternative applications in computing.},

Unlike many CS0 courses, this targets a predominantly mature age and part-time demographic, although high school leavers are also included. Our design attempts to recognise that computational thinking experiences are increasingly incorporated into school experiences, both through curricula and outreach. Consequently, a CS0 course no longer has the sole purpose of introducing students to computing. It also serves a bridging role, giving a compressed form of outreach and school experiences to adult learners who might have missed them. It also brings brings opportunities to compress the introduction of programming, so that more time can be spent in challenges that stretch students' experience, and in demonstrating its application to areas such as robotics and social AI.},

abstract = {Teaching students to become skillful problem solvers is a goal of university education, but it has been difficult to measure such skill or demonstrate the benefits of particular educational experiences. This paper presents a study of college students solving a problem unrelated to their academic majors. The analysis suggests that the educational experiences of Computer Science (CS) students may better train them in problem-solving than the experiences of other majors. In this study, students from a variety of undergraduate majors and grade levels were given a 15-minute problem-solving task embedded in an interactive science simulation. The complex task calls upon many problem-solving practices needed by scientists and engineers in their professions. Although this task has little resemblance to the problems encountered in a computer science course, CS students performed significantly better than students in any other major. In addition, only for CS students was there an indication of improvement in problem-solving from lower to upper grade levels. We propose that general problem-solving and computational thinking share some common practices, such as problem decomposition and comprehensive data collection. Furthermore, we present preliminary evidence that training in computational thinking is transferable to problem-solving tasks across domains and discuss how the unique features of CS programming assignments could be generalized to other science and engineering courses to foster students' general problem-solving skills.},

abstract = {In this poster, I examine a two-pronged, female-oriented, high school computing outreach program, FLAMES, incorporating 1) workshops throughout the school year and 2) an 8-week high school summer intern program run within the Game2Learn lab at North Carolina State University. I focus on examining the effects of the program on students' skills and affect towards computing. Literature has shown that socially relevant themes in computing are engaging for women and underrepresented minorities. Students understanding how these themes connect to computer science helps broaden their view of computing and increases their interest in pursuing a computing career. This initiative uses socially relevant themes, specifically around the context of developing educational tools and block-based programming activities for use in K-12 classrooms. High school students were trained to assist North and South Carolina teachers with the development of Computational Thinking-infused curricula for their science, math, English, and social studies classrooms. Additionally, summer students assisted in research labs alongside undergraduate researchers, aiding in field study observations, software testing, and data classification. This poster presents the design of the program, an overview of the curriculum, and results including both student and teacher feedback. Results show that the outreach program has benefited each of the parties involved, including its student participants, researchers, and the teachers assisted by the participants. I share lessons learned from this experience in order to help other CS departments develop similar broadening participation in computing programs.},

abstract = {With the rise of Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the elementary level, it is imperative for elementary computing instruction to support a variety of learners. TIPP&amp;SEE is a meta-cognitive learning strategy that scaffolds student learning when learning from example code. Results from a previous study show statistically-significant performance differences favoring students using the TIPP&amp;SEE strategy on a written assessment. In this work, our goal is gain insight as to it why such dramatic learning differences may have occurred. We analyze the students' computational artifacts and TIPP&amp;SEE worksheets. Artifact analysis reveals that students in the TIPP&amp;SEE group are more thorough in their work, completing more elements of the required tasks. In addition, they build open-ended projects with longer scripts that utilize more learned blocks. Worksheet analysis shows that students were highly accurate on some types of questions but largely skipped others. Despite these positive behaviors, there was little statistical correlation between student worksheet correctness, project completion, and written assessment performance. Therefore, while students in the TIPP&amp;SEE group performed actions we believe lead to more success, no individual actions directly explain the results. Like other meta-cognitive strategies, the value of TIPP&amp;SEE may lie in cognitive processes not directly observable, and may vary based upon individual student differences.},

abstract = {Advancing computational thinking in elementary education has been rapidly gaining attention due to the prospective of developing 21st century skills. However, interventions in this domain risk failure if they do not explicitly address the particular socio-cultural traits of the deployment scenario. This is the case in most countries of Latin America, where computing has not reached a sustainable penetration in K-12 education. In order to bridge this gap, we designed a one-week workshop for advancing computational thinking targeted to 10-12 years old Chilean students with no prior experience in programming. This paper describes our intervention and presents the results of a qualitative study analyzing positive and negative aspects of the experience. Although most participants effectively acquired basic programming skills by the end of the intervention, we also identified several inaccurate views on computing and computer scientists. For instance, computing was mostly perceived as a set of informal experiences rather than a way for enabling creation, automation, and work. The word "hacking" appears to be used as a metaphor for more technical terms, such as "programming" or "algorithm". Finally, negative stereotypical views of computer scientists resulting from the intervention were not as frequent as initial perceptions. These results provide fresh evidence on how to design, adapt, and evaluate computational thinking interventions targeted to K-6 students in Latin America.},

abstract = {School systems globally have begun to integrate computational thinking (CT) practices into elementary teaching and learning standards to provide young students with a comfort for and foundational understanding of computer science. This integration requires educating teachers to develop and implement CT learning opportunities. Our work contributes to best practice by exploring the role language plays in elementary teachers' discussions and development of CT-infused science lessons. To do this, we captured and analyzed the language used by elementary teachers as they spoke and wrote about CT in a multi-week professional development experience during which the teachers created and delivered CT-infused lessons to their students. We determined that teachers exhibited differing CT conceptualizations, which we categorized from broad to narrow. These differences were not, however, observed in either their spoken or written language. While there were instances of teachers using language that mirrored how the facilitators discussed CT, this use did not align with how they conceptualized CT. Our work analyzing connections between CT language use and CT conceptualization suggests that in order to understand how teachers are conceptualizing CT, professional development designers and teacher educators should focus on creating opportunities for teachers to employ CT practices in context rather than relying only on language. We feel this will support a more precise and nuanced engagement with CT.},

Yet, little is known about the relationship between reading and math proficiency, and the learning of key CS concepts at the elementary level. This study focused on 4th-grade students (ages 9-10) who were taught events, sequence, and repetition through an adaptation of the Creative Computing Curriculum. While all students benefited from access to such a curriculum, there were statistically-significant differences in learning outcomes, especially between students whose reading and math proficiency are below grade-level, and students whose proficiency are at or above grade-level. This performance gap suggests the need for curricular improvement and learning strategies that are CS specific for students who struggle with reading and math.},

abstract = {The rapid rise of computational technologies has heightened the demand for proficient computer scientists. A strong foundation in Computer Science (CS) and Digital Education (German: Digitale Grundbildung DGB) has become crucial, even for young learners. Despite the growing importance of CS and DGB in Austria, a gap remains in comprehensive understanding among students and educators. This study aims to bridge this gap by making CS accessible to primary school students and teachers. The solution, COOL Lab, is an active learning center offering diverse STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) programs. These programs facilitate cross-disciplinary education, supported by innovative CS technologies, nurturing computational thinking (CT) as a problem-solving tool, and enhancing digital skills. Focusing on COOL Lab Clubs, tailored for gifted primary school students, specifically the 'Girls* Only IT-Club' and 'Mini Club', this research first introduces these clubs and then presents insights from four club activities, along with methodologies enhancing CS and CT comprehension. Early results from a questionnaire involving 20 participants aged 9-10 were analyzed. At the outset, almost half of the participants, particularly girls, lacked exposure to CT and CS yet showed eagerness to learn. Initial findings of the club evaluations indicate a strong interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) as well as CS and a positive response to the COOL Clubs.},

That is why we have developed LearningML, aiming to provide a platform that supports educators and students in the creation of hands-on AI projects, specifically based on machine learning techniques. In this investigation we explore how a workshop on AI and the creation of programming projects with LearningML impacts the knowledge on AI of students between 10 and 16 years. 135 participants completed all phases of the learning experience, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic had to be performed online. In order to assess the AI knowledge we created a test that includes different kinds of questions based on previous investigations and publications - resulting in a reliable assessment instrument. Our findings show that the initiative had a positive impact on participants? AI knowledge, being the enhancement especially important for those learners who initially showed less familiarity with the topic. We observe, for instance, that while previous ideas on AI revolve around the term robot, after the experience they do around solve and problem. Based on these results we suggest that LearningML can be seen as a promising platform for the teaching and learning of AI in K-12 environments. In addition, researchers and educators can make use of the new instrument we provide to evaluate future educational interventions.},

abstract = {Background and Context. With increasing efforts to bring computing education opportunities into elementary schools, there is a growing need for assessments, with arguments for validity, to support research evaluation at these grade levels. After successfully piloting a 10-question computational thinking assessment (Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students – ACES) for 4th graders in Spring 2020, we used our analyses of item difficulty and discrimination to iterate on the assessment. Objectives. To increase the number of potential items for ACES, we created isomorphic versions of existing questions. The nature of the changes varied from incidental changes that we did not believe would impact student performance to more radical changes that seemed likely to influence question difficulty. We sought to understand the impact of these changes on student performance. Method. Using these isomorphic questions, we created two versions of our assessment and piloted them in Spring 2021 with 235 upper-elementary (4th grade) students. We analyzed the reliability of the assessments using Cronbach’s alpha. We used Chi-squared tests to analyze questions that were identical across the two assessments to form a baseline of comparison and then ran Chi-Squared and Kruskal-Wallis H tests to analyze the differences between the isomorphic copies of the questions. Findings. Both assessment versions demonstrated good reliability, with identical Cronbach’s alphas of 0.868. We found statistically similar performance on the identical questions between our two groups of students, allowing us to compare their performance on the isomorphic questions. Students performed differently on the isomorphic questions, indicating the changes to the questions had a differential impact on student performance. Implications. This paper builds on existing work by presenting methods for creating isomorphic questions. We provide valuable lessons learned, both on those methods and on the impact of specific types of changes on student performance.},

abstract = {Worldwide, many countries are implementing Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the primary and secondary school level. This push for CS/CT instruction in younger ages increases the need for pedagogical practices, such as learning strategies, that are effective for a wide array of learners. However, research into strategies for young learners is relatively sparse, especially compared with strategies at the university level. This study aims to investigate a commonly used practice at the university level, diagramming, as a potential strategy for students in grades 4-8 (ages 10-15). Our hope is that diagramming can be added to a suite of strategies to support program comprehension in younger learners.},

abstract = {This workshop introduces our elementary school programming curriculum, KELP-CS, and the corresponding programming environment LaPlaya. KELP-CS (Kids Engaged in Learning Programming) is an innovative, modular computational thinking curriculum for 4th-6th grade students. Off-computer activities connect computer science concepts to students' every day experiences. On-computer activities in LaPlaya develop students' computational thinking and programming skills. Finally, an engineering design project allows students to apply these new skills through an open-ended, creative project (e.g. digital storytelling in Module 1, and virtual game in Module 2). LaPlaya is a modified Scratch programming environment tailored to the developmental needs of 4th-6th grade students. In this workshop, we begin by introducing the KELP-CS curriculum; LaPlaya, the development environment used in the on-computer activities; and the resources for teachers embedded in both. Workshop participants will do sample on- and off- computer activities from Module 1 (4th grade) and discuss tips and strategies for teaching computational thinking with this age group. For the second part of the workshop, we provide additional background for participants interested in creating their own curriculum with LaPlaya. This includes how to create projects and their analysis.},

abstract = {Computing is a large and growing presence in society in 2020, and like many others, we see a strong demand from non-computing majors for "CS For All" courses. Unlike many others, we do not feel that putting traditional programming first is the best way to do this. Instead, we are rethinking the way we introduce computing to allow a broad audience to engage with this discipline.Any computational problem we might tackle requires that we explicitly think about the data involved to solve the problem. Likewise, many computational problems potentially have deep implications for the effect of emerging technologies on society including complex racial and social justice issues. When training novice computer scientists, too often the focus is on learning to write code, but not on explicitly learning computational thinking (data-first, declarative) and how to spot, analyze, and mitigate the ethical implications of potential computing solutions. When teaching those from other disciplines about computer science, the importance of learning to write code is diminished still further, relative to skills in computational thinking and in reasoning about ethical issues in computing and emerging technologies.},

abstract = {The implementation of computational thinking concepts in primary school curricula usually includes programming activities. As primary school teachers often lack subject knowledge, they may struggle to help students during these programming activities. Additional support can be provided by automated program analysis, for example in terms of hints on conceptual knowledge related to bad coding patterns observed, or procedural hints on how to solve the task at hand. However, care has to be taken since these hints need to balance (1) helping students to perform a specific task successfully, while nevertheless (2) ensuring a learning effect beyond the specific task. To understand the effects of different types of hints we therefore conducted a study with 36 children aged 7–12 in 10 programming courses. After being introduced to basic programming structures in three units, the children were tasked to debug six Scratch programs using different types of hints, where we observed that procedural hints have the strongest impact on performance. In order to examine an impact on the transfer of learned knowledge, we observed the children’s difficulties during the successive fifth unit, in which they created their own projects. The results of the fifth unit show that having received a procedural hint on a specific pattern during the fourth unit leads to slightly fewer bad related code patterns but also to slightly fewer good code patterns. Considering these results together with the subjective perceptions of the children, we can derive insights into how to best support performance and learning using (automated) feedback.},

abstract = {This experience report describes an approach for helping elementary schools integrate computational thinking and coding by leveraging existing resources and infrastructure that do not rely on 1-1 computing. A particular focus is using the school library and media center as a site to complement and enhance classroom instruction on coding. Further, our approach builds upon "unplugged" knowledge and practices that are already familiar to and motivating for students, in this case tabletop board games. Through these games, students can use their prior knowledge and ease with tabletop gaming mechanics to cue relevant ideas for core computational concepts. We describe a model and an instructional unit spanning across classroom and school library settings that builds upon board game play as a source domain for computing knowledge. Building on expansive framing, the model emphasizes instructional linkages being made between one domain (the tabletop board game) and another (specially designed Scratch project shells with partially complete code blocks) such that the reasoning activities and different contexts are seen as instantiations of the same encompassing context. We present the experiences of three elementary school teachers as they implemented the unit in their classrooms and with their school librarian. We also show initial findings on the impact of the unit on student interest (N=87), as measured by pre- and post- surveys. We conclude with lessons learned about ways to improve the unit and future classroom implementations.},

abstract = {Developing student interest is critical to supporting student learning in computer science. Research indicates that student interest is a key predictor of persistence and achievement. While there is a growing body of work on developing computing identities for diverse students, little research focuses on early exposure to develop multilingual students’ interest in computing. These students represent one of the fastest growing populations in the US, yet they are dramatically underrepresented in computer science education. This study examines identity development of upper elementary multilingual students as they engage in a year-long computational thinking curriculum, and follows their engagement across multiple settings (i.e., school, club, home, community). Findings from pre- and post-surveys of identity showed significant differences favoring students’ experiences with computer science, their perceptions of computer science, their perceptions of themselves as computer scientists, and their family support for computer science. Findings from follow-up interviews and prior research suggest that tailored instruction provides opportunities for connections to out-of-school learning environments with friends and family that may shift students’ perceptions of their abilities to pursue computer science and persist when encountering challenges.},

In this paper, we focus on deepening into the research on AR/MR technologies to foster students’ comprehension of socio-cultural values in historical contexts. We address this challenge by exploring the potential of the interaction paradigm called World-as-Support (WaS). We present a case study of an educational Virtual Heritage experience with primary students for a bomb shelter built during the Spanish Civil War. Our findings showed that the experience enhanced students’ capabilities to reflect upon high-level issues related to value human dignity, to grasp some of the essential qualities of the value solidarity and to connect historical events with present political situations in Spain. Finally, we discuss four design recommendations for learning activities based on the WaS concerning (1) the enhancement of students’ competences in collaboration, and communication; (2) critical thinking; (3) contextualization of historical contents; and (4) moral and ethical considerations for digital augmentation.},

The video and audio data from this event was analyzed to observe how children in a group respond to the robot’s unexpected behaviors. We extracted six different types of robot’s surprising behaviors: robot’s personality, movement malfunctions, inconsistent behavior, mispronunciation, delays and freezing. We analyzed how children in the younger and the older age groups respond to each of these behaviours, and what are the similarities and differences between the two groups. Based on this analysis, we suggest guidelines for designing age-appropriate learning interactions with social robots.},

abstract = {Worldwide, national initiatives have led to many school districts implementing computing curricula at the primary level. At that age, students are learning the foundational skills of reading and math. It is important to understand how computing can influence the development of these skills. While some argue that learning computing sharpens problem-solving skills that are applicable to other subjects, evidence supporting this belief is thin.In a quasi-experimental study of fourth-grade (ages 9-10) students, we compared state reading and math test scores of students receiving computing instruction with students who did not. Our findings demonstrated that a more open-ended, less scaffolded form of computing instruction was linked to performance gains in math, but not in reading (F(2, 232)=11.08, p&lt; .01, ηp2=.0625). When looking at students who face academic challenges that can impact reading and math, the same trend applied to students with economic disadvantages and students with limited English proficiency, but not for students with disabilities. These results suggest that moderately scaffolded computing instruction supports the development of skills applicable to math, a step towards better understanding the relationship between learning opportunities in computing and outcomes in other subjects.},

abstract = {Since the release of LLM-based tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT the media and popular scientific literature, but also journals such as the Communications of the ACM, have been flooded with opinions how these tools will change programming. The opinions range from “machines will program themselves”, to “AI does not help programmers”. Of course, these statements are meant to to stir up a discussion, and should be taken with a grain of salt, but we argue that such unfounded statements are potentially harmful. Instead, we propose to investigate which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. In this paper we report on an experiment in which we explore if Computational Thinking (CT) skills predict the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools. Our results show that the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools can indeed be predicted by the score on a CT assessment. There are many limitations to our experiment, and this paper is also a call to discuss how to approach, preferably experimentally, the question of which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. We propose to rephrase this question to include by what kind of people/programmers, to develop what kind of software using what kind of LLM-based tools.},

abstract = {While most teachers welcome the idea of learning activities fostering creativity, it is not clear how to effectively scaffold creativity. Without suitable pedagogical approaches, it is difficult to provide appropriate levels of scaffolding. Over-scaffolding, on the one hand, while providing support appreciated especially by less experienced students, leaves little room for creative expression. Under-scaffolding, on the other hand, while fostering more authentic learning opportunities with a high potential for creativity, can lead to student frustration. The Process Artifact Creativity Landscape (PACL) is a framework that helps pre-service teachers scaffold creative projects. PACL consists of a two dimensional space providing four scaffolding approaches offering different tradeoffs between scaffolding and creativity. This paper introduces the PACL framework and outlines experiences with K–6 preservice teachers reasoning about scaffold creative programming projects.},

Learning trajectories (LTs) for computational thinking (CT) topics will help to guide emerging curriculum development efforts for computer science in elementary school. This study describes the development of an LT for Debugging. We conducted a rigorous analysis of scholarly research on K-8 computer science education to extract what concepts in debugging students should and are capable of learning. The concepts were organized into the LT presented within. In this paper, we describe the three dimensions of debugging that emerged during the creation of the trajectory: (1) strategies for finding and fixing errors, (2) types of errors, and (3) the role of errors in problem solving. In doing so, we go beyond identification of specific debugging strategies to further articulate knowledge that would help students understand when to use those techniques and why they are successful. Finally, we illustrate how the Debugging LT has guided our efforts to develop an integrated mathematics and CT curriculum for grades 3-5.},

abstract = {This presentation examines the development of computing courses in the Irish school curriculum over a period of some fifty years. It aims to highlight three aspects: the varying rationales (for example, educational or economic) driving the work at different times; the types of course that were proposed and (in some cases) implemented; and the successes and failures experienced along the way. The third aspect, in particular, may offer lessons for other countries seeking to implement computing courses in schools. To frame the analysis, a brief chronological outline is provided here. In the 1970s, the state Department of Education initially offered some programming courses for teachers; a voluntary body, the Computers in Education Society of Ireland, advocated for the introduction of "Computer Studies" as a school subject [1]. Official provision came in the 1980s, with the introduction first of a Computer Studies option in the Mathematics courses for the senior cycle of post-primary education (US grades 11-12), and then of a free-standing subject in the junior cycle [1,2]. However, the increasing availability of educational software, applications packages, and internet access led to a switch in the focus of official policy in the 1990s - from computing to computer applications and the use of IT in teaching and learning - and the computing courses faded out [2]. Following the (re)-emergence of interest in computing / computational thinking in several countries in this century [2,3,4,5], advocacy for suitable courses again grew and the policy thrust changed. Provision is now made at primary and post-primary level, notably with a free-standing Computer Science course figuring in the senior cycle curriculum [2,5]. The author has been involved in advocacy and support for computing in schools throughout the fifty-year period. Thus, she offers a participant's analysis of the motivations, the successes and failures, and the lessons that can be learnt from the Irish story.},

abstract = {Although learning to program can improve students' computational thinking skills---specifically, creating and debugging algorithms---we need to determine instructional strategies that foster such skills in young students. We investigated the role of analyzing worked examples that focused on creating and debugging programming algorithms with 28 first and 27 third graders. Students played a tangible, block-based programming game, Coding Awbie, across six, 20-minute sessions and were randomly assigned to also analyze programming worked examples during sessions one to three (immediate group) or sessions four to six (delayed group). To measure changes in creating and debugging algorithms before and after their worked example intervention, students completed a pretest, midtest (after session three), and a posttest. By midtest, students who were in the immediate group wrote significantly more accurate programs, although both groups had similar accuracy when given the chance to debug their programs. By posttest, both groups made significant gains in accuracy of their programs. Overall, analyzing worked examples proved to be a powerful support for students' programming skills in creating and debugging algorithms. However, students' common bugs indicate that additional worked examples should focus on double-counting errors.},

abstract = {This lightning talk describes our current efforts to isolate and identify potential threshold concepts and threshold capabilities which are experienced by intermediate computer science undergraduate students. We are utilizing the theoretical framework as described by Meyer, Land, Bowden, and Baillie. Two of the key identifiable characteristics surrounding a threshold concept are (1) the transformation one undergoes as a result of incorporating the concept into their knowledge and (2) the state of uncertainty (liminality) experienced as the learner develops this understanding. As a result of this transformation and the resultant traversal of a liminal state, elements of an identity are often developed. For the computer science undergraduate, we hypothesize that advanced computational thinking skills are developed along with these transformations leading to the development of a computer scientist identity. Through identification of the threshold concepts/capabilities experienced by intermediate students the potential corollary concepts behind computational thinking may be uncovered as well. The overall project intends to integrate elements of threshold concepts, liminality, and transformative learning to produce a framework through which computational thinking can be probed and students' progression can be better assessed and supported. These efforts are only beginning - curious faculty and students are invited to attend our presentation and consider potential collaborative participation in our endeavors.},

abstract = {Learning trajectories are paths that students may follow in order to achieve their learning goals. Although the literature has addressed the subject, little has been done in the way of exploring how to visualize learning trajectories. In this paper, we present three forms of interactive learning trajectories visualizations linked to the context of computational thinking. As the interactions on visualizations involved different aspects, our proposal comprises three layers: the data representation, the reactions to the navigation and data exploration where more details of the data can be seen. Due to visualizations being tightly related to the context from which the data comes, we analyzed the data types available in Code.org, a well-known platform commonly used to teach computational thinking. To assess the three visualizations, we carried out usability and user experience evaluation with 23 Brazilian elementary schools teachers. The results revealed that the three visualizations achieved an average of 72% of overall understanding by the audience. Besides, our findings showed the visualizations were well accepted among the participants. We also found out that the user experience reported by the participants is in some way associated with the level of understanding of the visualizations.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovation that is rapidly transforming industries from agriculture to medicine, enabling advances such as real-time data monitoring and remote control. However, IoT's infiltration into education has been much slower, and educational tools that embody these features are few and far between. Together with the Chugach School District in Alaska, we investigated methods to teach middle-school aged students how to use IoT to drive change in their communities and collaborate in a digital world, tied to real time environmental data. The objective of this work is to provide rural, K-12 Alaskan students and teachers with opportunities that will help build an understanding of what is happening in their local environments, increase overall scientific and climate literacy, and contribute to community resilience and connectedness. Rural Alaskan students live in some of the most vulnerable regions of the planet, regions that are highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. In this work-in-progress paper, we first discuss the design and adaptation of Tekniverse, a hardware and software ecosystem that provides a gateway for students to code and connect hardware projects and data. We then discuss the finding of our initial study of Tekniverse as a learning tool for computational thinking, data analysis, and social responsibility in rural and remote areas with students in Alaska. Lastly, we propose future directions for this research and computational collaborative tools.},

abstract = {In Computer Science (CS), modeling with diagrams is a well-known practice to visualize complex software systems or database structures. However, modeling with e.g., entity-relationship diagrams or UML (Unified Modeling Language) is also helpful in other disciplines. In this research, CS models are used as a teaching and learning tool in foreign language acquisition. The field of computer science offers a variety of models that can visualize states, as well as processes and, are therefore very suitable for the different areas of language teaching (e.g., reading, writing, grammar-, or vocabulary acquisition). With CS modeling as a teaching and learning strategy, two main objectives are addressed: enhancing learning and retention and fostering computational thinking skills. This paper presents best practice examples on how to meet these two objectives as well as the results of a crossover study, where we investigated whether vocabulary acquisition is facilitated when it is thematically preorganized in class diagrams. The results illustrate that pupils who studied with the class diagram strategy had significantly higher recall performance than pupils who studied with the list of words. A qualitative analysis of the participants’ feedback after the intervention revealed decisive criteria for their preferences regarding the learning format.},

The study contrasts the challenges faced by students using the micro:bit with those from our team’s previous similar e-textile studies using the LilyPad Arduino. We pinpoint the BBC micro:bit’s limitations from an inclusive design perspective, underscoring the absence of gender-sensitive considerations in its hardware design. The paper presents a critique how upwards of £75 Million were spent deploying the micro:bit without proper user studies of gender equity and e-textiles. We propose design recommendations for future BBC micro:bit versions, advocating for integrating a gender-sensitive participatory design approach to enhance the usability and engagement of computational and creative making with e-textiles for children of all genders.},

abstract = {In response to the evolving digitized society, it is crucial to equip children with essential skills for critically and reflectively navigating this environment. Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) researchers have established rich research to advance educational practices and technology development for computational thinking education and introduced a new concept of computational empowerment. However, the absence of effective formative assessment in the research and practices within computational education hinders the facilitation of continuous learning and the enhancement of computational empowerment. Considering this, this doctoral study will explore the core research question of how to develop formative assessment strategies for computational empowerment through the lens of dialogic learning. The research aims to conceptualize a research-based formative assessment model for educators, formative assessment design principles for computational education toolkits and provide instances through illustrative case studies. The study includes literature reviews, learning intervention case studies and participatory design workshops, stimulating discussions and innovative formative assessment strategies for computational empowerment within the CCI community and among practitioners. This doctoral study addresses the need for effective formative assessment in computational education to understand learning, foster learning and enhance computational empowerment in wider implementation. The practical research outcomes will benefit toolkit designers and educators, while the theoretical contributions aim to fill gaps of formative assessment in CCI research and pedagogies, advancing the broader landscape of computational education.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study using a robotics platform for teaching computing and cybersecurity concepts to high school students. 38 students attended a week-long camp, starting with projects such as a simulation-only game and a simple autonomous driving program for the robots in order to learn and apply computational thinking (CT) and networking skills. They were then assigned a series of challenges that required developing progressively more advanced cybersecurity measures to protect their robots. This culminated in a final challenge that required implementing defensive measures such as encryption, secure key exchange and sequence numbers. We used an evidence-centered design framework to construct rubrics for grading student work. The pre- and post-test results show that the interventions helped students learn cybersecurity and CT concepts, but they had difficulties with networking concepts. These results correlate with scores from the game and the final challenge. Overall, surveys show that the competition-based robotics learning framework engaged students and supported their overall learning, but our intervention needs to be modified to help students learn networking concepts},

abstract = {Research has shown that free-form Game-Design (GD) environments can be very effective in fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills at a young age. However, some students can still need some guidance during the learning process due to the highly open-ended nature of these environments. Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs) can be used to provide personalized assistance in real-time to alleviate this challenge. This paper presents our results in evaluating such an agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make fewer errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Building from these results, we provide insights on how to provide IPA interventions in free-form GD environments.},

abstract = {Integrating computational thinking into middle school science classes through the use of programmable sensor technologies requires that students are familiar with the sensors and how the sensors can help them figure out the answers to their scientific questions. However current best practice in science education integrates science content and scientific practices (i.e. planning an investigation using the sensors) instead of teaching the practices first. In addition, the goal is to have the students recognize that the sensors would be useful for answering their current questions. To address this issue, I collaboratively designed a week long sensor immersion experience with middle school science teachers as part of a larger design based implementation research project that creates middle school science units that integrate computational thinking using these sensors. Through our observations and reflections with teachers, the necessity of a unit that introduces the students to the sensors became apparent. Working with the teachers, we developed a sensor immersion experience centered around the investigation of a classroom data display that illustrates information about the classroom environment using lights and sound. The data display was constructed using the programmable sensor technologies available to the students and the unit involved them creating and refining a model of how the classroom data display worked. This unit was implemented during the first three months of the 2019/2020 school year and preliminary results suggest that students have a better sense of the capabilities of the sensors and how they can help them in their scientific inquiry.},

The research team is partnering with a local public STEM high school to design, evaluate, and publicly share an enrichment course that introduces students to data analytics in the context of public health. Integrating data science education and public health will enable students to engage in meaningful data-driven problem solving while promoting civic engagement. A key challenge in introducing data skills in K-12 is addressing barriers to access. To cope with these barriers, the course design incorporates the use of spreadsheets to engage students in computational thinking. This poster will present preliminary assessment results from the 3-week enrichment course conducted in January 2024.

In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.},

abstract = {Massachusetts defined K-12 Digital Literacy/Computer Science (DLCS) standards in 2016 and developed a 5-12 teacher licensure process, expecting K-4 teachers to be capable of teaching to the standards under their elementary license. An NSF CSforAll planning grant led to the establishment of an NSF 4-year Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) of district and school administrators, teachers, university researchers, and external evaluators in 2018. The RPP focused on the 33 K-5 serving schools to engage all students in integrated CS/CT teaching and learning and to create a cadre of skilled and confident elementary classroom teachers ready to support their students in learning CS/CT concepts and practices. The pandemic exacerbated barriers and inequities across the district, which serves over 25,000 diverse students (9.7% white/non-Hispanic, 83.7% high needs). Having observed a lack of awareness and expertise among many K-5 teachers for implementing CS/CT content and practices and seeing barriers to equitable CS/CT teaching and learning, the RPP designed an iterative, teacher-led, co-design of curriculum supported by equity-focused and embedded professional learning. This experience report describes how we refined our strategies for curriculum development and diffusion, professional learning, and importantly, our commitment to addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion beyond just reaching all students. The RPP broadened its focus on understanding race and equity to empower students to understand how technology affects their identities and to equip them to critically participate in the creation and use of technology.},

abstract = {Our research is based on an innovative approach that integrates computational thinking and creative thinking in computer science courses to improve student learning and performance. Referencing Epstein's Generativity Theory, we designed and deployed Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) with linkages to concepts in computer science and computational thinking. Prior studies with earlier versions of the CCEs in CS1 courses found that completing more CCEs led to higher grades and increased learning of computational thinking principles. In this study, we extended the examination of CCEs to by deploying revised CCEs across two lower division (freshmen, sophomore) and three upper division (junior, senior) CS courses. We found a linear "dosage effect" of increasingly higher grades and computational thinking/CS knowledge test scores with completion of each additional CCE. This dosage effect was consistent across lower and upper division courses. Findings supported our contention that the merger of computational and creative thinking can be realized in computational creativity exercises that can be implemented and lead to increased student learning across courses from freshmen to senior level. The effect of the CCEs on learning was independent of student general academic achievement and individual student motivation. If students do the CCEs, they appear to benefit, whether or not they are self-aware of the benefit or personally motivated to do them. Issues in implementation are discussed.},

abstract = {The relevance of computational thinking (CT) in early education is globally recognized, with Uruguay already incorporating it into kindergarten curricula. However, there is a notable disconnect: existing CT tools, primarily devised for small home groups, fall short in larger classroom settings. To bridge this gap, we developed Robotito VPL – an innovative, free, open-source application tailored to teachers with no programming background. Robotito VPL enables teachers to guide young children in CT learning with Robotito, a robot that engages with its surroundings, supporting a playful, hands-on learning experience for children. This paper presents the results of two usability evaluations with seven teachers. We then translated the outcomes of these evaluations into valuable lessons learned and specific design requirements.},

abstract = {Computational thinking is nowadays considered an essential skill in the K-12 educational curriculum. Many tangible computational kits designed for early childhood are either too expensive to benefit a wide range of children or only provide predetermined challenges with limited creative content creation opportunities. In this paper, we investigated low-cost and expressive tangible interfaces that foster computational literacy. We present Draw2Code, a paper-based computational kit for young children to create an interactive AR animation. Children use Draw2Code to make their paper drawing alive as an animated virtual sprite and control it using hand gestures. It exposes children to basic programming concepts through playful and tangible interaction. Results from our initial evaluation with nine child-parent dyads indicate that children ages 5 to 12 successfully used Draw2Code and played with Draw2Code in 33 minutes on average while creating 2 to 5 diverse AR animations based on their ideas. Throughout the session, all children were engaged in computational thinking concepts and practices and learned drawing and gesture-based interactions.},

abstract = {Integrated computing uses computing tools and concepts to support learning in other disciplines while giving all students opportunities to experience computer science. Integrated computing is often motivated as a way to introduce computing to students in a low-stakes environment, reducing barriers to learning computer science, often especially for underrepresented groups. This study explored integrated computing activities implemented in US schools to examine which programming and CT concepts they teach and whether those concepts differed across contexts. We gathered data on 262 integrated computing activities from in-service K-12 teachers and 20 contextual factors related to the classroom, the teacher, and the school. Our analysis revealed that programming and CT concepts were inversely related to five contextual factors, such that factors predicting more CT concepts also predicted fewer programming concepts. These factors reflected school resources, such that wealthier schools used activities with more CT concepts and fewer programming concepts. In addition, factors related to underrepresented groups often related to fewer concepts being taught in activities. School racial composition was the only factor of the 20 that had a relationship with both types of concepts in the same direction-students from underrepresented groups used activities with fewer CT and programming concepts. Our findings suggest that, although integrated computing can potentially introduce computing to a broader audience, we must evaluate what these activities are teaching and to whom. Another primary contribution of this work is an open-access dataset about integrated computing activities, the concepts that they teach, and the contextual factors around their use.},

As innovations in machine learning technologies continue to shape society, it raises important implications for what young people learn, their career trajectories, and the required literacies they need to thrive in this changing occupational environment. Youth are particularly vulnerable to the impact of ML and very little has been done to empower them to critically engage in the discourse surrounding the next generation of technologies that have a marked potential to shape their lives for better or worse. My dissertation work seeks to develop youth autonomy and agency around ML by designing an intervention that supports youth critical use, examination, and production of ML applications in the context of promoting self-expression and social good. I will conduct a qualitative single case study research and collect multiple forms of data using interviews, story completions, digital artifacts, observations, and focus group discussions. These data sources will allow me to conduct an intensive analysis and investigation of how youth populations can be supported to develop the skills, practices and critical consciousness needed to effectively engage with machine learning technologies. Through my research, I also hope to advance the literature on how young people creatively collaborate with ML and use ML for self-expression.},

We measure the learners' perceived self-regulation and intrinsic motivation. The learners of Code.org show a higher intrinsic motivation compared to the Scratch group. Qualitative analyses of answers to open-ended questions reveal positive and negative aspects of the learning environments. With Code.org, the learners in particular like the fun and the challenges, while for Scratch, they like the feeling of actually programming something and the very free environment.},

abstract = {The rising interest of educators, researchers, and policymakers around the world as far as the development of computational thinking skills in compulsory education is concerned is echoed in the plethora of research studies discussed in the pertinent literature. However, the successful injection of computation thinking in formal educational settings demands the construction of developmentally appropriate assessment tools. In this paper, we discuss a novel framework for assessing computational thinking skills in early childhood settings. The proposed framework was employed in a relevant quantitative research study conducted in the city of Heraklion, Crete, from February to June 2019, with a sample of 435 first and second graders and within the context of the Environmental Study course. This paper also provides evidence regarding the examination of age, gender, and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course as predictive factors of one of the core computational thinking competencies, namely algorithmic thinking. The research findings revealed that age and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course constitute predictive factors for algorithmic thinking skills in the first and second grade level of primary school. On the contrary, algorithmic thinking skills are not related to first and second graders’ gender. The results of this study provide a solid background for designing and implementing developmentally appropriate tools for cultivating and assessing computational thinking skills in the early years of schooling.},

We focused on the three lowest categories of the Slovak contest, which include pupils of the whole primary school (aged 8 to 15) and analysed the tasks of the last four years. We used both qualitative and quantitative data analysis research methods. Task were divided into subcategories which were further analysed, focusing on identification of the specifics of the tasks in which there were significant differences between boys and girls. Using comparative analysis, it was found that boys are better in tasks with simple (relatively abstract) representation of the structure which is described by a larger amount of text, but the main point of the task is to identify the problem and create or uncover a strategy for finding a solution. Girls' performance is better in tasks that have less text, relatively more complicated representation of the structure and are focused on simple operations at graphs or reading them.},

abstract = {Computing and computing concepts are interconnected with virtually every aspect of daily life and every field of study. However, when teaching new computing concepts to novice programmers, the number of example domain applications that can be presented is extremely limited. In addition, programming assignments where students apply these concepts are typically closed-ended, fully defining the problem to be solved. As a result, there are few opportunities for students to take an active role in creating connections between computing concepts and situations where they can be applied. See Logic in Life exercises are short, non-programming exercises comprised of a logical and a visual component. The exercise format provides opportunities for students to explore and create their own connections between computing concepts and application domains. Further, by sharing these connections with fellow classmates, students are exposed to a breadth of applications for a given concept via a peer learning experience. Student feedback on the impacts of both creating and sharing computing connections via See Logic in Life exercises is presented. Sample See Logic in Life exercises, suitable for use in CS0 or CS1 as in-class, out-of-class, or active learning exercises, are freely available at youtube.com/virt-university.},

abstract = {As computer science instruction gets offered to more young learners, transitioning from elective to requirement, it is important to explore the relationship between pedagogical approach and student behavior. While different pedagogical approaches have particular motivations and intended goals, little is known about to what degree they satisfy those goals.In this paper, we present analysis of 536 students' (age 9-14, grades 4-8) work within a Scratch-based, Use-Modify-Create (UMC) curriculum, Scratch Encore. We investigate to what degree the UMC progression encourages students to engage with the content of the lesson while providing the flexibility for creativity and exploration.Our findings show that this approach does balance structure with flexibility and creativity, allowing teachers wide variation in the degree to which they adhere to the structured tasks. Many students utilized recently-learned blocks in open-ended activities, yet they also explored blocks not formally taught. In addition, they took advantage of open-ended projects to change sprites, backgrounds, and integrate narratives into their projects.},

abstract = {Engaging in physical computing activities involving both hardware and software provides a hands-on introduction to computer science. The move to remote learning for primary and secondary schools during the 2020-2021 school year due to COVID-19 made implementing physical computing activities especially challenging. However, it is important that these activities are not simply eliminated from the curriculum. This paper explores how a unit centered around students investigating how programmable sensors that can support data-driven scientific inquiry was collaboratively adapted for remote instruction. A case study of one teacher’s experience implementing the unit with a group of middle school students (ages 11 to 14) in her STEM elective class examines how her students could still engage in computational thinking practices around data and programming. The discussion includes both the challenges and unexpected affordances of engaging in physical computing activities remotely that emerged from her implementation.},

Our design-based, collaborative learning environment aims to provide students in K-12 classrooms with immersive experiences in CT through computational modeling in realistic scenarios (e.g., building models of scientific phenomena). The goal is to increase student engagement and include inclusive opportunities for developing key computational skills needed for the 21st century workforce. Research implementations that include a semester-long high school physics classroom study have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in supporting synergistic learning of STEM and CS/CT concepts and practices, especially when compared to a traditional classroom approach. This technology demonstration will showcase our CS+X (X = physics, marine biology, or earth science) learning environment and associated curricula. Participants can engage in our design process and learn how to develop curricular modules that cover STEM and CS/CT concepts and practices. Our work is supported by an NSF STEM+C grant and involves a multi-institutional team comprising Vanderbilt University, SRI International, Looking Glass Ventures, Stanford University, Salem State University, and ETR.

Our knowledge is limited since most designs focus on sequential programming and on the cognitive aspects of computational thinking. This paper discusses a design that integrates ill-structured socio-scientific issues with programming and other computational concepts, in a playful and meaningful context. The design, called ChoiCo (Choices with Consequences), builds on the idea of "integrated affordances" that enables layered computational access, allowing children to be players and designers of choice-driven simulation games. We elaborate on a design-based research that studied children's activity, who progressively played, modified and co-created games that simulated real-world issues. We describe four strategies developed by the children to make sense of the simulated problems through a systems thinking approach. We also discuss how they formulated these strategies by utilizing the affordances of map design, data manipulation and coding.},

Concerns have been raised regarding a too instrumental and uncritical implementation of programming. This study follows a preschool and reports on the obstacles infused during a six-month design-based study introducing a programmable floor robot with children, featuring formative focus group sessions and pedagogical development. An activity theoretical approach was taken to examine the various tensions with existing pedagogies that arose during the project and how these led to pedagogical development toward a programming ethos based on making pedagogical materials and tinkering activities, where failure is an inherent part of the educational process. The paper discusses the potential problems of using new subjects with current curricula and how new technologies are part of reshaping childhood pedagogies.},

Our goal has been to introduce modeling and computational thinking into learning high-school physics. There are two main contributions from an M&amp;S perspective: (1) the use of conceptual modeling, and (2) the application of Finite State Machines (FSMs) to model physical behavior. Both of these techniques have been used by the M&amp;S community to model high-level "soft systems" and discrete events. However, they have not been used to teach physics and represent ways in which M&amp;S can improve physics education. We introduce the NSF-sponsored STEPP project along with its hypothesis and goals. We also describe the development of the three STEPP modules, the server architecture, the assessment plan, and the expected outcomes.},

Results show a moderate increase in minimum spanning tree performance; however, differences between gender, collaboration method, and game genre preference are apparent.

abstract = {In recent years, a growing number of universities have begun to offer specialized courses as a way to make computer science (CS) more accessible to students with little or no prior CS or programming experience, especially non-CS majors. One of the ways courses have been modified for these students is by supplementing the core problem solving and coding aspects of the curriculum with explicit instruction on computational thinking principles. These "computational thinking" courses are promising in that they ground computational thinking in discipline-specific contexts and emphasize application of computational principles. However, there is little empirical research evaluating the extent to which students learn computational thinking from these courses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an online Computational Creativity course on students' computational thinking skills, creative competencies, and self-efficacy. Students in the Computational Creativity course were predominantly non-CS majors, and they completed four Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) that have previously been shown to improve learning and achievement. Results indicate that the Computational Creativity course was effective in increasing students' computational thinking knowledge and self-efficacy for applying computational thinking in their fields, but it did not have an impact on students' creative competencies. Additionally, students' reactions to the course and the CCEs were mostly positive. Thus, this study provides initial evidence that non-CS majors can learn computational thinking through the online Computational Creativity course.},

One of its most ambitious and important goals is the inclusion of Computer Science Education already on the primary school level, an important measure in achieving the establishment of an information society. Such a reform raises questions about the appropriate types of approaches to be developed and employed for an effective implementation of Computer Science Education concepts in Swiss primary schools. To this end, the project "Scalable Game Design Solothurn" was developed and evaluated. This project both trained teachers and exposed students to Computational Thinking concepts through the two Computational Thinking Tools AgentSheets and AgentCubes online. Results show that teaching Computational Thinking through Scalable Game Design is not only feasible on the primary school level but also enjoyable, with AgentSheets and AgentCubes online proving to be sustainable and effective tools for the implementation of Computer Science Education on this school level. Further analysis of the data enables us to make recommendations regarding optimal ways of implementation for the Swiss reality and point towards new research directions.},

Evaluation of instruction requires valid measures of curriculum implementation. We have developed measures for identifying conditions for successful implementation of an introductory high school computer science curriculum along two-dimensions: teaching quality and curriculum enactment. Additionally, we have defined three types of instructional strategies for teaching quality. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 53 teachers through surveys and interviews. Data were aggregated and integrated to derive scaled measures for the instructional strategies and curriculum adaptation, and implementation measures were correlated with student end-of-unit assessment data. We found potential factors that can enhance or impede the successful implementation of CS curriculum materials, and we have identified several broad issues associated with scaling up CS curricular implementation.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has become the calling card for re-introducing coding into schools. While much attention has focused on how students engage in designing systems, applications, and other computational artifacts as a measure of success for computational thinking, far fewer efforts have focused on what goes into remediating problems in designing systems and interactions because learners invariably make mistakes that need fixing-or debugging. In this panel, we examine the often overlooked practice of debugging that presents significant learning challenges (and opportunities) to students in completing assignments and instructional challenges to teachers in helping students to succeed in their classrooms. The panel participants will review what we know and don't know about debugging, discuss ways to conceptualize and study debugging, and present instructional approaches for helping teachers and students to engage productively in debugging situations.},

The LearningML project aims to bring the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to children and people interested in acquiring knowledge on this subject in an easy way. AI has heavily irrupted in society and everyone is using, more or less consciously, application based on AI. Therefore, some kind of AI literacy is needed if we are to educate critically thinking citizens able to understand technologies that have a relevant impact on their lives. In this presentation we show how LearningML can help us to reach this goal trough programming applications based on Machine Learning (ML), the most prevalent subfield of AI today.},

In this paper, we explore an extension to an initial set of Project moveSMART computer science learning activities to introduce elementary students to machine learning concepts in a way that is integrated with required learning objectives covered in a Physical Education course. Specifically, students use the BBC micro:bit and its on board sensors to capture rhythmic movement data, explore and analyze patterns in the data, and use a learned "dance move recognition" application that uses their data in order to learn about machine learning in an age appropriate way. To demonstrate feasibility of supporting dance move recognition on the resource-constrained device, we developed a prototype, which is able to detect 5 different dance moves with a 96.6% accuracy.},

Our technique has been adopted in creating tutorial series for four Computer Science and Engineering courses, ranging from the first year to the third year. Analytics of these online tutorial videos is presented to show the average amount of time which each registered student spent on watching them. Course evaluation results indicate that our technique is perceived as effective for achieving the course learning outcomes. Comparison of students' performance on complex topics (arrays and loops) also indicates a positive impact of our approach.},

abstract = {Proponents of computing education have long stressed the value of computing for learning in other disciplines. Much of the research towards this end has focused on supporting learning in science, engineering, and mathematics (or STEM). However, a trend towards computing in non-STEM disciplines is growing, yet the research base is more limited. We add to this emerging area of research by investigating the potential for integrating computing and literacy education. This paper reports the results of a six-week intervention during an after-school program in a British primary school. We describe the development of a curriculum unit and report on the first iterative cycle in a design-based research project. Our analysis shows that integrating programming and literacy activities supported novice learners in areas of computing such as algorithm design and program execution through a combination of short problem-based tasks and longer project-based activities. Likewise, programming supported learners in creating digital stories by visualizing narrative structure though some caveats were found. We discuss the results of this study and implications for future work in this area.},

abstract = {There is wide-spread agreement that K-12 students need opportunities to explore computer science (CS) concepts and computational thinking within a wide array of disciplines for advancing, broadening, and diversifying the participation in CS. Programs such as "Computer Science for All" were created by the US government to motivate and help students of all ages to engage with CS, which was described as the "new basic skill for economic opportunity and social mobility". However, what is less understood is how to prepare teachers to engage with CS concepts and computational thinking, expanding their specialized and pedagogical content knowledge on these concepts. This study explores this gap in the context of a graduate-level secondary math education methods course in a university environment. To reduce the cognitive load for the teacher candidates as well as their students, we utilize the secondary mathematics curriculum to explore CS concepts infused into mathematics, avoiding at the same time an increase to the teaching hours to the extent that it is detrimental to the existing K-12 curriculum. Our study uses hybrid block-text programming-based teaching modules specifically designed to expose the similarities and the differences between mathematics and CS. We utilize the concept of variable and operations around it to explore how the teacher candidates' conceptions and misconceptions about CS make the understanding of those concepts easy or challenging, and how that affects their ability to incorporate them into their teaching.},

We report on a framework for analyzing PD research with children and demonstrate how PD can support transformative agency of children through vignettes from two PD projects with children. Based on the vignettes, we provide a set of additional PD aims to consider when integrating the scaffolding of transformative agency explicitly in PD with children. A focus on children's transformative agency will contribute significantly to the maturing field of Computational Empowerment in CCI as an extension of the current PD work with children.},

abstract = {The goal of teaching everyone computing (explicitly including programming) predates the definition of the computer science (CS) major and even the prospect of a software development career. At the University of Michigan, we are creating courses for non-CS majors which are grounded in the computational practices of liberal arts and sciences faculty. These courses have no connection to the CS major curriculum or software development jobs. We focus here on two of the themes that those faculty valued (Computing for Expression and Computing for Justice) and the introductory courses that we designed around each theme. The courses emphasize gaining broad perspectives of computing, which serve the study of multiple disciplines. Student activities include readings, writing essays, classroom discussion, and open-ended programming homework assignments. This experience report describes our design process, the Creative Expression and Social Justice courses, and an initial evaluation of our design. Most of the programming assignments were written in the block-based programming language Snap!, with some in-class exercises using teaspoon languages. Several units ended with an ebook assignment to connect the Snap! programming to equivalent programs in Python, Processing, and SQL. Interview and survey findings suggest that students found this sequence and the courses useful, despite not counting toward a CS major or focusing on early software development skills. Students described usefulness in terms of developing general computing knowledge, preparation for a range of future careers, and introducing them to other course choices.},

All the schoolchildren involved in the project attend a weekly computer lab class held throughout the school year. They work on individual projects during the first half of the year. Then, in the second half of the year, they work in small groups on a common theme that the teacher selects from those studied in class. In this poster, we report the work of a fifth-grade class (24 students -- 7 females and 17 males, aged 10-11) in the 2017-2018 school year. Findings from individual and group Scratch programs produced, self-evaluation questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with the groups are presented.},

Based on the shortcomings of existing tools, Flowgramming – a platform independent flowcharting software for the novice programmer / problem solver and their instructor, is also proposed in the paper. Flowcharts developed using Flowgramming can be executed by the built-in interpreter which helps the novice programmer focus on understanding the problem solving strategy in a visually appealing manner and also allows for a language independent learning of solution strategies.},

abstract = {One of the skills that comprise computational thinking is the ability to read code and reason about the hierarchical relationships between different blocks, expressions, elements, or other types of nodes, depending on the language. In this study, we present three new instruments for assessing different aspects of reading hierarchies in code, including vocabulary, reasoning, and fluency. One of these instruments is Nester, an interactive tool we have designed to elicit mental models about the hierarchical structure of code in computing languages ranging from HTML, CSS, and LaTeX to JavaScript and Lisp. We describe a lab study in which we administered these instruments to 24 participants with varying degrees of web development experience. We report findings from this study, including participants' ability to define, reason about, and manipulate hierarchies in code, and the errors and misconceptions that relate to them. Finally, we discuss avenues for future work.},

abstract = {Starting Fall 2016, the CS department at USC has begun offering CS100: Explorations in Computing, a brand new General Education (GE) course. The course is only open to non-CS majors (since our CS students go through a CS-specific introductory track that encompasses the CS100 material). The class has 24 students, from a variety of disciplines such as Communications, Business Administration and Theatrical Arts. The course presents a broad overview of computational/algorithmic problem-solving techniques that form the basis of today's digital society. It provides students, a strong foundation for understanding how everyday activities such as web searching, communicating via social media, playing games, booking a ride, etc., work "behind the scenes". The course's intent is to promote computational thinking, as put forth by Jeannette Wing and others. In designing the course, the following aspects were kept in mind: the course is formulated as a GE, for a non-CS audience - so it cannot be heavy on coding; the topics need to involve some form of computational/algorithmic approach; the topics need to have a connection with things that students do with their digital devices (eg. play games, send instant messages, order things..); the topics have to grab the students' attention (keeping in mind that they grew up with tablets, the Web, animated movies and videogames). To that end, the topics are grouped under the following headings: Media Computing, Recreational Math, Algorithmic Art, Social Media and Data.},

To visually connect the domains and a program, a key diagram conceptualising the three aspects lies at the approach’s heart, alongside instructional exposition and exercises, which are all presented. Students find the approach challenging initially, but most recognise its value later, and identify, unexpectedly, the value of the approach for problem decomposition, planning and coding.},

abstract = {Understanding scope rules, the rules for the binding of variable uses with variable declarations, is a necessary skill for reading and understanding program code. It is also one that novice programmers often find challenging. To better understand which misconceptions novice Python programmers commonly hold about scope rules, we pose the question of "To what extent do misconceptions exist even for a simple subset of scope rule features?". The answer to this question can determine the level of complexity of scope rule features the instructor should focus on.We consider a subset of Python that only has non-recursive and non-nested function definitions, scalar variables, and global code that calls the function definitions. We also consider the variable categorization into local variables, parameters, and global variables. We developed an assessment tool that we used as part of the final examination in a CS1 course for three semesters. We found that though there were significant misconceptions for some features, the number of such features is limited. This identification of the common misconceptions for this subset of Python can aid in revising the instructional focus to help future students better understand scope rules.},

abstract = {Over the past five years, there has been a major push to develop the computational thinking skills of K-12 students. Tools such as Scratch, Alice, and Kodu have been developed to engage students in learning to program through the creation of computational artifacts (e.g., games, animations, and stories). However, less is known about how elementary and middle school children reason about program behavior. Such skills are useful for reading and adapting others programs, locating possible sources of bugs, and predicting program behavior given code snippets (i.e., mental simulation). The goal of this poster is to measure and track the development of students' ability to reason about programs using Teague &amp; Lister's Neo-Piagetian classification of novice programmers: Sensorimotor, Preoperational Thinkers, and Concrete Operational Thinkers. We operationalize Teague and Lister's category descriptions by creating a criterion for each category. This classification has helped us characterize students' mastery of strategies for reasoning about the lawful behavior of programs using a Kodu curriculum. In particular, this categorization was used to differentiate students' reasoning styles using data from two studies having 20 and 19 students each. We found strong consistency in the results across both studies. Through analysis and categorization of student responses, most students fall into the preoperational thinker category. Within this category, we found a diversity of mastery patterns that help us understand where students face challenges in reasoning about programs.},

The report was issued in July 2018 and recommends, in conformance to Spanish educational laws, to establish a matter called "Informatics". This matter would preferably be implemented as a mandatory course offered from primary to secondary education. The course contents comprise six areas: programming, computers and operating systems, networks and the Internet, data, digital content, and security. The course would include issues of both digital literacy and computing as a discipline, with digital literacy contents based on the European DIGCOMP framework.},

We present a history of our CS0 course and the lessons learned from the most recent redesign of the course. We review the last decade of student assessments and how they influenced the latest iteration. We contrast the expectations of students in a CS0 course with those in a CS1 course. We discuss the national efforts to make CS accessible to all and explore the challenges unique to a CS0 course. We demonstrate similarities between our course and the Advance Placement CS Principles and show where differences are justified. We review the relevant pedagogical research for CS0 and present lessons learned over multiple iterations of the course. Based on our current course review and implementation, we believe that Computer Science for everyone is attainable and relevant to the needs of every student.},

In doing so, we present a single quantitative measurement for GCS. Our model, called GCS 2.0, has face validity for 39 games, each programmed by a pair of middle school children. We choose four of these games, two with high GCS and two with low GCS, and discuss the computational building blocks found in each game. We do this to help the reader better understand our measurement of GCS and its relationship to CL.},

Cooperative Thinking is not only the sum of Computational Thinking and Agile Values, rather it is a new overarching competence suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems. We suggest to tackle the Cooperative Thinking construct as an education goal, to train new generations of software developers to Pareto-optimize both their individual and teaming performances.},

Furthermore, current research indicates that first-exposure to computer science is an important deciding factor as to whether students are open to computer science in future endeavors. Being one of the most diverse campuses in the nation, and a commuter campus, The State University of New York (SUNY) Old Westbury provides a unique opportunity to pilot how one might go about creating a motivating first exposure to computer science. Through a four point student-led strategy, we explore student pre-conceived attitudes towards computer science and programming to better understand what strategies might increase CS engagement. In order to do this, we host workshops revolving around creative computer science activities such as 3D game design and multimedia art projects. During these workshops, we collect pre and post questionnaires and use their data to gain insight into the Old Westbury student body's notions of computer science. Initial analyzed pre-survey data shows that 70% of students thought Computer Science was difficult. However, post-survey data shows that, after the experience, approximately 90% of students want to take additional workshops involving Computer Science.},

Economically devastated by the departure of the coal industry, these communities are committed to developing high-quality computing curricula for all students, beginning in their earliest years. The poster has two components. First, through a mixture of qualitative measures, the poster reports on the genesis and development of the RPP. It focuses on the RPP's origin in leveraging the districts' existing relationship with Pennsylvania's South Fayette School District, which has developed one of the nation's leading programs for teacher professional development (PD) in K-12 computing. The second component of the poster focuses on the development of a series of summer workshops for Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors to learn the basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing K-8 coursework. Of course, the RPP faced new challenges with COVID-19 most notably, the need to offer these summer workshops remotely, and adjusting the objectives and research questions accordingly. Through focus groups with the PD instructional team and survey responses from the KY teacher workshop participants, the poster will report on the pedagogical implications of offering teacher PD exclusively online and what the ramifications have been for Pikeville and Floyd County children with the return to school in the Fall of 2020.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on using computational thinking (CT) to teach mathematical concepts. The integration of math+CT enables students to gain a deeper understanding of both mathematical and computer science (CS) concepts. Although numerous professional development programs provide teachers with a solid understanding of CT and methods for integrating it into the curriculum, there has been little research on how teachers apply this knowledge to the design and development of math+CT activities. Moreover, the majority of integrated activities are concentrated in the upper elementary grades, while the early grades (i.e., K-2) remain underexplored. The purpose of this study is to describe how teachers translate their CT knowledge in the collaborative design of an integrated math+CT activity focused on number sense and mathematical operations for grades K-2. Research faculty from the CS and Teacher Education departments designed block-based programming activities for K-2 students to explore and make sense of place value representations of the numbers 1 - 1000. In-service elementary teachers in an online graduate STEM CT course (N = 13) experienced these activities as learners and provided feedback for redesign from their perspectives as classroom teachers. Qualitative analysis of collaborative problem-solving slides and individual reflections revealed how teachers connected their mathematical knowledge for teaching place value to their emergent understanding of CT concepts of abstraction, decomposition, and debugging. This research bridges the gap between enthusiasm for math+CT integration and teacher capacity to use CT to promote creative mathematical thinking and problem-solving in K-2 classrooms.},

The kit uses modular pieces that allow students to both solve and create troubleshooting and debugging challenges, which we call "DebugIts." We tested our prototype in an after-school workshop with ten high school students, and report on how they interacted with the kit, as well as what they learned through the DebugIt activities. In the discussion, we delve into the affordances and challenges of using these kits as both learning and assessment tools. We also discuss how our pilot and prototype can inform the design of reconstruction kits in other areas of making.1},

abstract = {As K-12 computer science (CS) initiatives scale throughout the U.S., educators face increasing pressure from their school systems to provide evidence about student learning on hard-to-measure CS outcomes. At the same time, researchers studying curriculum implementation and student learning want reliable measures of how students apply their CS knowledge. This paper describes a two-year validation study focused on end-of-unit and cumulative assessments for Exploring Computer Science, an introductory high school CS curriculum. To develop the assessments, we applied a principled methodology called Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) to (1) work with various stakeholders to identify the important computer science skills to measure, (2) map those skills to a model of evidence that can support inferences about those skills, and (3) develop assessment tasks that elicit that evidence. Using ECD, we created assessments that measure the practices of computational thinking, in contrast to assessments that only measure CS conceptual knowledge. We iteratively developed and piloted the assessments with 941 students over two years and collected three types of validity evidence based on contemporary psychometric standards: test content, internal structure, and student response processes. Results show that reliability was moderate to high for each of the unit assessments; the assessment tasks within each assessment are well aligned with each other and with the targeted learning goals; and average scores were in the 60 to 70 percent range. These results indicate that the assessments validly measure students' computational thinking practices covered in the introductory CS curriculum. We discuss the broader issues we faced of balancing the need to use the assessment results for evaluation and research, and demands from teachers for use in the classroom.},

abstract = {In recent years, the push for secondary school students to “learn to code” has increased significantly. Currently, about half of secondary schools in the United States have computer science education available to students in some form. Unfortunately, many of these schools choose a curriculum bogged down in the nuances of programming language syntax, leaving students bored, confused, unable to apply their learning to useful problems outside the classroom, and therefore disheartened about further pursuing a more conceptual computer science education in college. As a current undergraduate who has helped teach secondary school computer science, I witnessed firsthand the problems with current approaches. I, therefore, propose a shift in the focus of computing education research away from teaching “coding” effectively to elucidating a more abstract but nevertheless more pragmatic characterization of computer science as an academic field, rather than programming as a trade.},

Over the course of a year, the teachers engaged in a week-long summer workshop and monthly follow-up training with in-classroom support as they integrated educational robots into their math curriculum. Surveys, tests, and teacher lesson plans were analyzed to better understand how the PD contributed to teacher's knowledge and skills. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests indicated that teacher rankings on their attitudes towards and planning practices with educational robots were statistically significantly higher at the end of the PD. The improvement was further reflected in the quality of their lesson plans. Implications for preparing teachers to use educational robots to teach computer science in elementary mathematics are discussed.},

abstract = {Programming is playing an increasingly important role in various fields, including science. However, traditional programming instruction tends to use small-scale and general examples to explain syntax and semantic meaning of the code, which cannot foster students' programming ability of solving real-world problems. This research was intended to develop a modelling-based instruction for scientific programming to guide students to solve programming problems based on the modelling process (phenomenon description, data modelling, algorithmic modelling, coding, and verification and debugging). A learning platform based on the proposed modelling process was also developed to assist science-major students to learn how to solve real-world scientific problems by programming. An empirical study was conducted on thirty-two science-major college students to prove the effectiveness of the modelling-based scientific programming. The experiment results show that students who engaged more in modelling had higher programming performance. The modelling-based instruction actually helps students to write programs for solving scientific problem by using both of data and algorithmic models.},

Together with the workshop participants, we will approach this research space from a feminist perspective, engaging with feminist issues, such as participation, advocacy, pluralism, and embodiment. Through innovative body-centered methods, we will foreground and explore individual and collective sensations of security, and materialize participants’ felt experiences and insights in the form of wearable prototypes.

abstract = {Data science is emerging as a crucial 21st-century competence, influencing professional practices from citing evidence when advocating for social change to developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. For middle and high school students, data science can put formerly decontextualized subjects into real-world scenarios. Many existing curricula, however, lack authenticity and personal relevance for students. A critique of data science courseware cites the lack of "author proximity," in which students do not contribute to the data's production or see their personal experiences reflected in the data. This paper introduces a novel data science curriculum to scaffold middle and high school students in undertaking real-world data science practices. Through project-based learning modules, the curriculum engages students in investigating solutions to community-based problems through visualization and analysis of live sensor data and public data sets. Materials include formative assessments to help educators (especially those from non-math and computing backgrounds) measure their students' abilities to identify statistical patterns, critically evaluate data biases, and make predictions. As we pilot and co-design with teachers, we will look closely at whether the curriculum's resources can successfully support non-technical practitioners engaging in an integrated curriculum.},

abstract = {Mathematics is usually taught using a traditional pencil-and-paper approach and frequently lacks real-world contextual referents, leading to a sense of alienation among secondary students and missed opportunities to advance students’ mathematical and computational thinking. In contrast, many real-world problems require mathematical solutions that are often of such a scale that they can only be solved using computational techniques, but require powerful ways of thinking that span the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Mathematical Practices (MP) and Computer Science Principles (CSP). We describe here our program that aims at advancing both MPs and CSPs through the introduction of technology and computing into the high school discrete mathematics curriculum. Our goal in the first two years of this new program is to reach a cohort of 40 teachers and 72 students. Using lessons learned from this pilot, we will consider how our program can be scaled up to reach a much larger audience.},

Although these lessons reach more students through the core curriculum, proper evaluation methods are needed to ensure the quality of the design and integration. As part of a research practice partnership, we work to infuse research-backed curricula into science courses. We find a three-pronged approach of evaluation can help us make better decisions on how to improve experimental curricula for active classrooms. This CEO model uses three data sources (student code traces, exit ticket responses, and field observations) as a triangulated approach that can be used to identify programming behavior among novice developers, preferred task ordering for the assignment, and scaffolding recommendations to teachers. This approach allows us to evaluate the practical implementations of our initiative and create a focused approach for designing more effective lessons.},

While much of this work focuses on designing technologies and environments for children, we contribute a unique perspective of children as designers of these technologies. In this paper, we explore how children embody and debug computational algorithms through designing their own mixed reality games. We conducted two afterschool workshops with 19 middle school aged children (3 girls, 16 boys, ages 10-13) during which participants designed mobile, location-based games with mixed reality technologies about local plants and animals. Findings reveal how participants across workshops embody a key game mechanic (digitally spawning characters in the real world) by engaging in an iterative digital-to-physical-to-digital debugging process that led to their understanding of the underlying computational algorithm. We further present design considerations for authoring platforms that allow children to design with mixed reality, place-based technologies.},

Although the representational forms chosen by students were mainly traditional, our findings indicate that they were engaged in authentic data visualization practices throughout their programming process. These practices included translating ideas into programs, selecting parameters (such as color scheme and space between data points), inspecting the output, and adding annotations to provide context and better communicate the desired information. Moreover, our analysis pointed out opportunities for improving PlayData, mainly by the addition of new primitives for automating labeling and performing data transformations.},

Twenty-six middle school students were asked to program interfaces for controlling the heading and speed of a robot using two types of embodied interaction modalities. We compared touch and full-body gestures to autonomous control, which does not require any embodied interaction. We assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the projects they created during a problem-solving task and examined their understandings of science concepts related to kinematics. We found that novice students preferred full-body interfaces, while advanced students moved to more disembodied and abstract computational thinking.

abstract = {In this demo, I will present an activity that I use to introduce computational thinking in my non-majors course and outreach talks at high schools. I do this by first talking about what modeling and simulation are and why they are useful. Following this explanation, I introduce a variant of a problem about Alice and Bob. In the original problem, Alice and Bob take turns flipping a coin until one of them gets heads and wins. If Alice goes first, what is the probability that she wins? In class, I introduce this variant of the problem: "Bob suggests to Alice that they play a game. They will take turns flipping a coin until one of them wins by getting heads. The winner will then receive a dollar from the loser. If Bob says he will always let Alice go first, should Alice play the game?" While this problem is trivial for those comfortable with basic probability and familiar with geometric sequences, most of my students who are not computer science majors are not comfortable with math. Thus, I explain that although the problem can be solved with some math, instead we should first model the problem. Once we have modeled the problem, I have my students get some intuition by pairing off and having each pair play the game 20 times. I collect the results and discuss how so few trials are not sufficient to draw conclusions. Finally, I run a simulation that runs the game one million times and demonstrates that Alice should win 2/3 of the time and thus should play the game.},

abstract = {If computer science programs face a challenge of convincing students that programming is fun and achievable, they have nothing on mathematics departments who face societal beliefs that math is hard and scary. Several movements in computer science education have focused on broadening participation within computer science and across disciplines. The "CS + X" efforts have focused on helping computer science integrate into other disciplines. The "CS For All" movement has highlighted the importance of providing high quality computing education for all students. Simultaneously, there is increasing attention to the need to provide general education alternatives to college algebra. This paper describes a course designed to combine these goals: a course that uses programming to introduce students to functions, patterns, and spatial and computational thinking in order to meet quantitative reasoning goals set by the university. The course initially used Bricklayer as the programming environment, then transitioned to Processing. Students were successful in writing programs that created art, demonstrated mastery of quantitative literacy, and had improved attitudes following the course. This project suggests that in addition to the creation of introductory computer science classes, courses which embed computer science into disciplinary requirements can be a successful pathway to expand opportunities for students to learn computing.},

abstract = {This practical report explores the impact of forced learning design changes due to the Corona pandemic. At the School of Education Northwestern Switzerland over 2000 K-6 pre-service elementary school teachers got educated in computer science and computer science education over the last five years employing a learning design evolved through a Design Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach. Assessing efficacy of the course through effect sizes the 2019 courses have served as pre-Corona baseline. Changing hastily in 2020 to online learning dramatically shifted the learning design in ways not initially anticipated in the DBIR process. Collaborative face-to-face (f2f) learning activities got replaced with individual online learning. Employing effect sizes has allowed us to quantify a Corona effect by comparing self-efficacy measures before Corona and during Corona. While there where only small effect sizes (0.5 &gt; Cohen's d ≥ 0.2) all these small effects were positive suggesting that the individual/online seminar worked slightly better than the collaborative/f2f seminar. The report highlights the most important changes to the learning design and compares 2019 with 2020 using effect sizes. For the most part the report can only speculate about the most relevant factors in the design change resulting in the unexpected overall improvement of course efficacy. It could be the shift from collaborative to individual practices, the mandatory peer feedbacks, or the online learning situation.},

abstract = {Active Learning approaches have found success in CS1 and CS2 courses, consolidating instructional time on the practical, problem-solving aspects of programming. With the increasing availability of generative Artificial Intelligence Assistants, there is a renewed push to focus on higher-order skills beyond syntax and solving programming problems by matching sample outputs.This poster examines the impact of conceptual explanation-based exercises in introductory programming courses through the implementation of a scaffolded semi-flipped classroom. This method is currently in its third semester as a part of an ongoing, iterative, semi-experimental approach to support student resilience in entrance-level courses. This approach aimed to enhance student engagement, retention, and performance by integrating weekly practice sessions and "group-tutoring" sessions facilitated by peer learning assistants. In these sessions, students were encouraged to articulate their problem-solving strategies and the reasoning behind their solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of programming language paradigms and problem-solving techniques.The findings indicate that this method significantly increased classroom engagement, as students became more active participants in their learning journey. Retention rates improved as students became more confident in understanding and applying programming concepts. Overall, student performance saw a notable rise, with students demonstrating a better grasp of programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches beyond rote memorization and matching sample outputs.},

abstract = {While understanding in the field of how CT can be used in early childhood is limited, current CT definitions include skills and practices that align with early mathematics and science learning goals outlined in national frameworks (e.g., Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework) and state standards. In order to understand which elements of CT align with the abilities and interests of young children and how they can be integrated with early science and math experiences in a mutually supportive manner, we partnered with preschool teachers and families to co-design and pilot test hands-on (unplugged) and digital activities for classrooms and homes.Our collaborative research identified the following CT skills as productive starting points for our co-design work: (1) problem decomposition; (2) algorithmic thinking; (3) abstraction; and (4) testing and debugging. This paper describes our approach to operationalizing CT for early learning and our empirical research around activities designed to understand how CT can be linked with math and science to create powerful learning experiences for preschool learners. Our work involves actively fostering a home-school connection for promoting CT and prioritized designing for activities that fit the ecology of preschool classrooms and homes (with special attention to family activities). With a view to designing equity-oriented experiences, we partnered with preschools serving historically underserved communities, and centered families' funds of knowledge. This paper focuses specifically on the home component of the program and shares data and analyses about children's and parent's experiences at home---which activities were more successful and resonated with children and families, and which specific synergies emerged between CT skills, math and science concepts and practices. Our findings highlight the promise of introducing early CT to support early learning, and especially involving families in the process. Results from our research also identified challenges that should be addressed in future iterations of this design research We believe our family connection activities are not only a unique part of the research but also an exemplar of what should be an essential piece of STEM education for young learners.},

abstract = {Many children begin to learn to code in a self-directed context, such as by creating an animation, game or phone app. Recent research has begun to investigate and evaluate the results of this process: children's projects. However, little is known about the different trajectories novices have during the long-term process of self-directed programming learning. Our aim is to identify the existing types of trajectories and be able to determine a specific child's trajectory. If that trajectory does not lead to significant progress or continued motivation, we might be able to nudge them toward a different trajectory.We hypothesized that there may be several main types of trajectories. To explore this, we clustered children's programming progression in order to identify trends. We used a data set of Scratch programs for its large sample size and diverse population [1,3]. We used Dr. Scratch's scoring of computational thinking skills as our initial feature set [2]. Our clustering analysis identified two main groups of users. The first group, 55.8% of users, generally progressed upward over time in their computational thinking skill score. The second group, 44.2% of users, showed little to no improvement over time.These preliminary results raise many questions about these two high-level groupings of trajectories of computational thinking skill demonstration in Scratch projects. In the future we want to further explore the trajectory clusters and what they could mean for supporting self-directed learning of programming.},

This article describes a meta-synthesis of research on children designing and programming computer games that investigates the extent to which there is evidence of benefits for computer science learning and motivation. Over 400 articles were identified, and 68 articles met the inclusion criteria. A systematic analysis and synthesis across studies showed some evidence that computer game design and programming can lead to changes in programming knowledge, problem solving, and computer science attitudes and confidence. However, most of the evidence described engagement in computing-related practices and did not measure learning. The findings were mostly positive, although several studies noted more negative attitudes toward programming after making games. The results were similar across different pedagogical approaches, although social interaction may provide unique opportunities for computer science learning. The synthesis resulted in a list of design elements for studying computer game design and programming activities; these can be used to increase the availability of evidence about learning. The article concludes with the identification of gaps in the research and suggestions for additional research.},

Prior work has studied various quiz types, such as fill-in-the-gap write-code questions. However, the overall impact of these quizzes is unclear: studies often show utility in the learning phase when enhanced with quizzes, though limited transfer of utility in the post-learning phase. In this paper, we aim to better understand the impact of different quiz types and whether quizzes focusing on diverse skills (e.g., code debugging and task design) would have higher utility. We design a study with Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by code.org as the base curriculum, interleaved with different quiz types. Specifically, we examine two learning groups: (i) HoC-ACE with diverse quizzes including solution tracing, code debugging, code equivalence, and task design; (ii) HoC-Fill with simple quizzes on solution finding. We conducted a large-scale study with 405 students in grades 6--7. Our results highlight that the curriculum enhanced with richer quizzes led to higher utility during the post-learning phase.},

abstract = {The teaching of introductory computer science can benefit from the use of real-world context to ground the abstract programming concepts. We present the domain of pencil puzzles as a context for a variety of introductory CS topics. Pencil puzzles are puzzles typically found in newspapers and magazines, intended to be solved by the reader through the means of deduction, using only a pencil. A well-known example of a pencil puzzle is Sudoku, which has been widely used as a typical backtracking assignment. However, there are dozens of other well-tried and liked pencil puzzles available that naturally induce computational thinking and can be used as context for many CS topics such as arrays, loops, recursion, GUIs, inheritance and graph traversal. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we present a few pencil puzzles and map them to introductory CS concepts that the puzzles can target in an assignment, and point the reader to other puzzle repositories which provide the potential to lead to an almost limitless set of introductory CS assignments. Second, we have formally evaluated the effectiveness of such assignments used at our institution over the past three years. Students reported that they have learned the material, believe they can tackle similar problems, and have improved their coding skills. The assignments also led to a significantly higher proportion of unsolicited statements of enjoyment, as well as metacognition, when compared to a traditional assignment for the same topic. Lastly, for all but one assignment, the student's gender or prior programming experience was independent of their grade, their perceptions of and reflection on the assignment.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate how the inclusion of computational creativity exercises (CCEs) merging computational and creative thinking in undergraduate computer science (CS) courses affected students' course grades, learning of core CS knowledge, self-efficacy, and creative competency. CCEs were done in lower- and upper-division CS courses at a single university. Students in CCE implementation courses were compared to students in the same courses in different semesters. Propensity score matching was used to create comparable groups (control and implementation) based on students' GPA, motivation, and engagement. Results showed that implementing CCEs in undergraduate CS courses enhanced grades, learning of core CS knowledge, and self-efficacy for creatively applying CS knowledge. However, CCEs did not impact creative competency. The effect of the CCEs was consistent across upper- and lower-division courses for all outcomes. Unlike previous studies that only established the support for CCEs, such as positive dosage effects, the results of this study indicate that CCEs have a causal effect on students' achievement, learning, and self-efficacy, and this effect is independent of general academic achievement, motivation, and engagement. These findings establish the CCEs as a validated, evidence-based instructional method.},

abstract = {The CS community has struggled to assess student learning at the K-8 level, with techniques ranging from one-on-one interviews to written assessments. While scalable, automated techniques exist for analyzing student code, a scalable method for assessing student comprehension of their own code has remained elusive. This study is a first step in bridging the gap between the knowledge gained from interviews and the time efficiency and scalability of written assessments and automated analysis. The goal of this study is to understand how student answers on various types of questions differ depending on whether they are being asked about their own code or generic code. We find that while there were no statistically-significant differences in overall scores, questions about generic and personalized code of comparable complexity are far from equivalent. Our qualitative analyses revealed interesting patterns in student responses, inviting further research into this assessment technique. In particular, students answered differently from students with generic code when presented with individual blocks from their code taken out of context and placed into different code snippets, and students answered in a way that demonstrates a functional, instead of structural, understanding on Explain in Plain English (EiPE) questions.},

Individuals could design and build their own personalised digital interventions to help them reach their goals, but little is known about this process. Building upon previous research we propose the Behaviour Change with Trigger-Action Programming (BC-TAP) model which describes how individuals could bridge the gap between their current and desired behaviour through the creation of 'Do-It-Yourself' (DIY) digital interventions. We conducted a two-day participatory workshop based on the BC-TAP model with 28 participants. Participants articulated plans to change a behaviour of their choice and represented these plans in mobile device automations. After using their interventions for up to three weeks, participants reflected on their experience. Our findings report opportunities and challenges at each stage of the process. While formulating a digital proxy for certain behaviours was challenging, both failures and successes facilitated participants' awareness of their behaviour, and their ability to change it.},

abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have worked to bring computer science to all students. However, CS is still an inequitable field. When developing curricula, we must account for the importance of connecting the lives and identities of historically marginalized students with instructional materials. We examine the knowledge and experiences that elementary (age 9-10) students drew upon to implement an open-ended programming assignment about themselves. We coded the Scratch projects of 189 students to investigate what aspects of their lives students reference, and how they use various modalities in Scratch to create digital media products about themselves. In our data, we found that the most common spheres portrayed were identity, hobbies and leisure, and interests. When expressing their identities, students narrated their experiences, expressed consciousness about their skills, connected to the user via their interests, and sometimes discussed equity. Additionally, our findings add to previous literature on Scratch as an effective platform for digital media production. In particular, we found that students used dialogue, images, sound, and the title to represent their spheres of influence through programming multimedia and interactive projects. This work has implications for the development of curricula and teaching guides for upper elementary students courses on computational thinking. Spheres of influence could inform researchers on the most influential aspects of students life in a specific context, providing elements for creating culturally relevant and interest-based materials and lessons.},

abstract = {It's an exciting time in computer science education on the K-12 landscape. Educational jurisdictions around the world are incorporating computer science concepts, as well as related computational thinking components, into their mandatory, K-12 curriculum. As we develop and implement curriculum initiatives with an eye on the future and the 21st century learner and citizen, what wisdom can we gleam from the past? In Ontario, Canada computer science education dates back to 1966 with the release of the Ministry of Education's Data Processing course that included a number of computer science and computer programming concepts and ideas. The document also frames computer education within the context of an emerging field and highlights the importance of students developing appropriate computer skills in order to thrive in the labor market and society. While we often consider computer science curriculum initiatives in K-12 education nascent, are important historical policy and initiatives being overlooked? This lightning talk shares preliminary findings from an analysis of five historical computer science curriculum documents. Grounded theory was used to discover emergent themes and concepts apparent in historical documents including ethical computing, the role of technology in society, and the cross-curricular nature of computer science skills. These preliminary findings inform the discussion surrounding the use of historical curriculum to establish best practice in existing curriculum and policy development.},

In this paper we report a pilot study exploring research and design approaches in creating learning environments and tools, which stimulate the interest of children and adolescents for both computer science and music in a sustainable way in the context of creative, self-guided activities. For the purposes of the study, two online tools, AgentCubes online, a 3D game design environment, and Ludosonica, an interactive music composition and performance system, were employed in a series of workshops designed for primary and secondary school children. Results from the study generally confirm the pedagogical potential of Computational Music Thinking and point toward promising future research directions.},

abstract = {As computer science education is incorporated into the United States educational system, it is imperative that children, educators, and caregivers understand the requisite competencies called "computational thinking" (CT). CT has advanced since first described by Wing in 2006 as an algorithmic problem-solving approach. For three years, the INSPIRE Research Institute for Pre-College Engineering (INSPIRE) has studied integrated science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computational thinking (STEM+C) learning for K-2 aged children, in both formal and informal settings. At the project's origin, the team focused on characterizing and operationalizing the CT competencies. Our studies then followed how children, instructors, and families engaged in the CT competencies within school and out-of-school. As the project evolved, our team created curricula to be used in K-2 classrooms, activities for out-of-school settings, a summer training for educators, a CT exhibit at a small Midwestern science center, and facilitated a field trip for elementary students. Our poster presents findings from all stages of our NSF-funded STEM+C project. For classroom settings, we report discoveries from integrated STEM+C curricula development and children's CT capabilities and engagement within the classroom and during homeschooling. For informal settings, we report children's abilities to engage in CT when engaging with a specially designed CT exhibit and an open-ended problem-solving task. We also discuss our data management for our project. Finally, we report the lessons and implications of CT for K-2 ask a viable skill for computer science education. For additional info ideas, handouts will be given during poster presentation.},

abstract = {The use of computational technology is common in K-12 education. Existing work on the use of technology have often focused on experiments without considering the educator’s viewpoint. Yet, educators are those who deal directly with the student and introduce these technology to the student. This paper examines the perception of educators on the use of computational technology in the classroom. We conducted a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions with K-12 educators. The data from the study was then analysed to extract thematic group perceptions on the use of technology in the classroom. The results show that most educators believe that technology enhances learning in general even though there may be some aspects of learning that are inhibited by technology. Furthermore, the solutions offered by computational technology are instrumental in solving business, health, and societal problems. These industry relies on the problem-solving capacity of learners from the school system who possess computational skills. Hence, the educators recommend that students should be introduced to computational technology as early as possible because the knowledge of computational technology is essential for the students’ future careers.},

abstract = {The poster presents Bebras informatics tasks based on assembling a program from blocks. These tasks were created in templates based on Papert's microworlds and they familiarize pupils with classical problems used in CS education. In these microworlds, pupils create and run a program which controls a sprite in order to solve a problem emerging from a described situation.We created four such templates. Each template was supplied with its own set of tasks, differing in a topic, a subject matter and graphics. We created more than 100 tasks in total. As pupils go through each task, they repeatedly run the created program while the system provides them with feedback. Some of the tasks were included into the Czech Bebras Challenge, whereas from others we created sets of tasks (like Hour of code) usable in lessons.More than 430 000 pupils aged 10 to 19 from hundreds of Czech schools tried these tasks in 2021, 2022. Our experience shows that these tasks with their interactivity can attract pupils to the contest and thus can contribute to advance pupils' informatics skills.},

Colby College has offered a Visual Media focused CS1 course since 2008, and in response to faculty and student feedback, we expanded our curriculum to include a second context-based CS1 course focused on Science applications. Our goal was to have completely different projects but teach the same fundamental concepts. In order to measure whether students in each version were learning the same concepts, and to reduce confounding factors, the same professors co-taught both versions of CS1 and students completed the same homework, quizzes, and final exam. Our analysis of the quiz, final exam, and final overall performance showed no statistically significant difference by context or by gender. There was also no difference by context or gender in whether students took additional CS courses in the following two semesters. Furthermore, as a percentage of the students eligible to take the next offering of CS2, Data Structures and Algorithms, 48% of the students in these two offerings of CS1 registered for CS2, with no significant difference between contexts. Our conclusion is that we were successful in achieving similar outcomes, and the benefits of context-based CS1 courses, in both the Visual Media and Science versions of the course.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has rapidly captured-again-the attention of practitioners and the CS Education community. Several initiatives have been spawning to identify effective ways to introduce learners at college and high-school levels to the basics of AI. In this context, we developed Scratch-NB, an extension to the Scratch programming language to equip K-8 learners with foundational tools for developing a Naive-Bayes classifier, explicitly transparenting its internal components. We opted to use Scratch due to its popularity within the CS4All movement and its predominance in schools, and extend the language with a simple implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier as a gateway for introducing basic notions of supervised learning and AI. In this paper, we report the design rationale of our tool and our experience of using it in an informal workshop with children aged 10-12 with no prior knowledge of computational thinking, coding, or AI. The obtained results show that Scratch-NB showed high levels of acceptance among the participants, raised interest in AI, and effectively provided basic foundations, particularly when comparing Scratch-NB with other state-of-the-art tools targeted to this learner group. We argue that our tool has the potential to illuminate further practical and research endeavors when exploring how to effectively introduce younger populations to the foundational notions of AI in practical contexts.},

Early work focused on ''physics of video games'' activities for high school physical science and physics while later work has ventured into content for astronomy and high school mathematics. Some of these activities appear on hourofcode.com and in ''instructional supports'' for physical science in Ohio. An important component of our efforts is creating high quality videos that walk through our activities on the STEMcoding youtube channel (http://youtube.com/STEMcoding). These videos frequently feature women and students from underrepresented groups. Ultimately our goal is to encourage high school science and math teachers to integrate computer science and data science content into their subjects, even if they do not have the credentials to teach computer science. This can enhance science and math classes, and as these teachers become comfortable with this approach, some go on to become certified to teach computer science.},

These 'smells' can be caused by a lack of abstraction, a skill that plays a key role in computer science and computational thinking. We created Pirate Plunder, a novel educational block-based programming game, that aims to teach children to reduce smells by reusing code in Scratch. This work describes an experimental study designed to measure the efficacy of Pirate Plunder with children aged 10 and 11. The findings were that children who played the game were then able to use custom blocks (procedures) to reuse code in Scratch, compared to non-programming and programming control groups.},

The framework, known as ABC, presents computing as a modelling activity, with: a multitude of possible problem/task domains, or Application Areas (A); sets of Building Blocks (B), such as programming languages and other computing systems, which can be used for model building; and a set of skills enabling the Creative Construction (C) of a solution, or model, of a problem/task in a particular application area, using a particular building block system. How the ABC Framework can be used to help orient students and structure learning and teaching is presented, as well as insights derived from students and teachers of an introductory programming course where this approach is used.},

abstract = {Digital competence (DC) is a broad set of skills, attitudes, and knowledge for confident, critical, and responsible use of digital technologies in every aspect of life. DC proves essential in the contemporary digital landscape, yet its diffusion is hindered by biases, misunderstandings, and limited awareness. Teaching Informatics in the educational curriculum is increasingly supported by the institutions but faces serious challenges, such as teacher upskilling and support. In response, grassroots movements promoting computing literacy in an informal setting have grown, including EU Code Week, whose vision is to develop computing skills while promoting diversity and raising awareness of the importance of digital skills. This study extensively analyses EU Code Week editions spanning 2014 to 2021 across European Union member states, pursuing three primary objectives: firstly, to evaluate teacher engagement in the campaign in terms of penetration, retention, and spatial distribution; secondly, to characterise the multifaceted audience and themes embraced by these initiatives; and, lastly, to investigate the influence of socio-economic factors on engagement. The investigation uncovers the underlying mechanisms fostering Code Week’s engagement, providing insights to campaign organisers for strategic planning and resource allocation in future editions. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the most engaged areas are characterised by lower income as well as lower digital literacy, restricted access to technology, and a less established computer education, suggesting that Code Week thrives precisely where its impact is most needed.},

abstract = {Code quality is of universal concern among educators. Refactoring code, i.e., revising the structure of a program without changing its behavior is one approach for improving code quality. Numerous software tools have been created to help students refactor the code they write. Only a few software tutors have been reported in literature that help students proactively learn code quality by solving refactoring problems. But they suffer false positive and false negative grading issues because they allow freehand coding. We investigated whether refactoring tutors that do not allow freehand coding could be used to help students learn about non-trivial anti-patterns. We developed and deployed two software tutors for refactoring problems that are based on the principle of "refactoring without rewriting code", and cover a subset of refactoring problems that can be solved using only deletion, duplication, reordering and token-wise editing of lines of code. We investigated whether students needed to learn the anti-patterns covered by the tutors and whether they benefited from using the tutors. In this experience report, we start by describing the tutors - the list of refactoring concepts covered, the user interface, grading, feedback and usage. We report our experience using the tutors over three semesters, which confirmed that both introductory and advanced students needed and benefited from using the tutors despite the limitations of the tutors' coverage. We reflect on what worked and what did not. The tutors currently cover C++, Java and C#. They are available for free for educational use on the web at auglets.org.},

This paper reports on our experiences designing and running workshops with (and for) teachers. Collectively, the aims of the workshops were geared ultimately at encouraging teachers to work with technologies in more `designerly' ways in the classroom, i.e. looking at technology as a working material, rather than as an off-the-shelf tool for certain activities, educational content or as an isolated part of the curriculum. We present a case study of one of the workshops, the Community Garden, designed in the format of a hackathon. We report on how teachers adopted the workshop concept, appropriated the technologies and, more interestingly, how six months later they appropriated the design process as a pedagogy to engage students in their learning.},

However, little research has explored how such computational tools might support forms of emotional literacy such as developing an understanding of emotions. Through an exploratory design with 11 participants, Scratch was used to create models representing participants' emotion knowledge. The overarching research question focused on how might computational tools aid in supporting reflection on emotion knowledge. Analysis of artifacts generated through sketching and Scratch, as well as transcribed design discussions were used as points of data analysis. Drawing on theories of computational thinking and emotional literacy, we present an analysis that highlights the potential for such tools to support certain reflective practices around emotion knowledge.},

As new technologies rapidly expanded the field, the computer science curricula emerged. The current undergraduate areas of study, including computer science and software engineering, focus on preparing students for careers in the computing industry or academia. The “born digital” students of a modern liberal arts institution need a different, less technology-heavy, form of computing education to support their careers as future scientists, artists, or humanists. At our large, research-focused, US university, the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) charged a task force with defining the computing education needs for their students, chaired by the authors. We describe our process, findings and outcomes here with the aim of offering a reference template to faculty at universities that have experienced a similar growth to prominence of computer science in the undergraduate curriculum. The task force identified emergent themes of discovery, expression, and justice that we using to establish a new program, the Program for Computing in the Arts and Sciences (PCAS). Our themes and process may help other liberal arts and sciences programs organize the computing education needs in support of all their undergraduate students.},

abstract = {For over 50 years, computer scientists whose backgrounds span many academic and corporate affiliations have attempted to truncate a novice programmer’s investment into their learning that might expedite the length of time required to advance from beginner to intermediate programmer. Widely accepted innovations in programming languages that use blocks instead of text to maintain novices’ motivation and attention have replaced some conventional text-based pedagogies at the pre-college level [8]. This study aims to contribute new knowledge to the Computer Science Education (CSEd) field to empirically validate whether text or block-based languages optimally prepare high school students for success in undergraduate level CS1 (Introduction to Computer Science) courses. The research sub-focus aims to distinguish the significance of equitable preparation between students from underserved communities and their peers arriving at college from affluent areas. This study introduces a 7-week, mixed-methods inquiry aimed at entering first-year undergraduate students enrolled in CS1, exploring their prior programming knowledge and experiences that might establish a relationship among high school programming curricula and learners’ CS1 achievement.},

abstract = {Abstraction is a fundamental yet challenging skill to teach and learn in Computer Science education. Traditional frameworks of abstraction and concept formation often emphasize understanding an abstraction over its application, the latter being critical for practical Computer Science. Additionally, a common issue in education is when students may understand a concept in a classroom or a very specific setting but struggle to apply it outside of that context. In response, we present here a novel pedagogical framework designed to enhance both the development and application of abstraction skills in diverse educational contexts within the field of Computer Science. Our framework synthesizes common themes from existing models while introducing a new dimension focused explicitly on the actionable development of abstraction skills. Educators can adapt the framework to various educational contexts to support development of students' abstraction skills. Our framework was iteratively developed through a combination of theoretical analysis and reflective practice across multiple teaching contexts. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework by applying it to various case studies, demonstrating its broad applicability and practical utility. By offering a flexible yet comprehensive structure, our framework enables educators to effectively organize and deliver educational content, guiding students from abstract theoretical concepts to their practical application in Computer Science.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, CS Education researchers have developed different curricula, resources, and strategies to foster computer science learning in K-12 education. However, there is a lack of research about how elementary school students develop the ability to reason about programs. Reasoning about programs consists of a student's ability to read, write, debug, trace, and predict program behavior. This paper presents results from a think-aloud study of fourth and fifth grade students learning to program in Kodu. The goal of this study was to track students' understanding of how Kodu interprets and executes rules of a program. To understand students' reasoning of program execution, we explicitly taught them the Laws of Kodu computation which govern the decision making and execution process of Kodu rules. We collected students' responses on pre- and post-assessments, and we conducted think-aloud interviews with students where students explained their answers to assessment questions. We found that explicitly teaching students how Kodu rules are interpreted significantly improved their ability to understand the execution of programs and to explain program behavior. The results of this study provide insight into how elementary school students reason about simple programs, and how this ability can be scaffolded.},

Our ethnographic research suggests that while young people sense they can't “trust” AI, many are not sure how it works or how much control they have over its growing role in their lives. In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.},

abstract = {Language is a key topic of interest for students in the humanities -- language is the way in which humans express themselves, communicate, and make art. Computing on language (e.g., recognizing language, generating language, building bots) can be a pathway into using computing for humanities contexts. At the University of Michigan, we are developing a new program to support students in liberal arts and sciences to learn about computing, explicitly including programming. We have designed two courses for introducing computing (1) in terms of creative expression and (2) around the implications of computing on justice. In both classes, we use a scaffolded sequence of programming languages and activities to explore computing on language: (a) a teaspoon language for sentence generation and recognition, (b) a set of custom Snap blocks for sentence generation and recognition, (c) a set of custom Snap blocks for building Chatbots, and (d) an ebook activity for mapping from Snap to Python. Each language takes less than 10 minutes to introduce, with a wide variety of possible student activities (for in-class active learning or for later homework). While the tools build on each other, the earliest stage (the teaspoon language) could be used within a single class session in linguistics, communications, or other liberal arts courses.},

abstract = {Drawing on Mishra and Koehler's "TPACK" model [1], we recognize that great Computer Science (CS) teaching demands great pedagogy, great technology skills and great subject knowledge. The main challenge facing any jurisdiction in implementing a CS curriculum within schools is the shortage of new teachers being trained in CS and to meet the demand many countries have focused on professional development (PD) for existing teachers across a diverse range of subjects. Some initial PD efforts in CS were often brief, with little follow-on support, and supported through external grant funding. This created challenges and opportunities for teacher PD in CS. As the need for CS at the K-12 level continues to grow, approaches should be sustainable and scalable. This includes preparing teachers at all levels, pre k-12, while they are still learning to be teachers and some funding initiatives have included preservice teacher support as part of this [2]. Inside the European Union (EU) the Scientix project [3] represents a focus European Commission (EC) funded projects and is a repository for PD with resources for pedagogy, technology and subject knowledge. Besides this effort, spreading CS knowledge has been supported by volunteers led movements like CoderDojo. The panelists will discuss the following main topics: 1) Pre-service vs in-service, where do teachers come from? 2) Interdisciplinary ways of infusing CS. 3) Ways of replicating across countries CS teacher training initiatives aimed at sustaining and growing the number and quality of both in-service and pre-service teachers able to teach CS effectively. 4) Effective approaches to help teachers to build confidence in their ability to teach Computer Science (CS)},

abstract = {CT has been the central rallying point for K-12 computing education at least since the early 2010s. Many teachers, school administrators, and policymakers have joined the movement. A consensus has emerged over the conceptual landscape of CT. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) has triggered some major changes in many sectors of computing. Children’s lives today are full of ML-driven services—take TikTok’s spot-on recommendations, social media’s automatic tagging of their friends in photos, and targeted personalized advertisement, just to mention a few. Children cannot learn to think about and design ML technology from learning classical programming. ML is poised to upend the CT consensus. Look at some of the changes ML has already triggered in computing. It has enabled greatly improved speech and image recognition, powerful recommendations on streaming services, autonomous navigation of cars, super-human performance in board and computer games, and even alternative-reality “deepfake” videos. Most advances in topics above are due to hardware evolution to non-traditional, special purpose architectures, new algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or generative adversarial networks (GAN), and new objectives and measures of success. We will show that several key CT concepts, including debugging, problem-solving workflow, correctness, and notional machines, are insufficient for ML and need to be extended. Moreover, ML introduces new concepts including neural networks, curating and training data, and reinforcement learning that are not part of CT at all. All these changes challenge the traditional views related to teaching CT in K–12. ML is not the only emerging technology appearing in the computing landscape. Quantum computing and biological computing are not far behind. We need to start rethinking how CT must evolve to anticipate and meet these challenges.},

abstract = {Montessori pedagogy has a comparatively long tradition of more than 100 years while CS education still is an innovative and future-oriented discipline. Montessori pedagogy is in particular known for its material and accompanying methods, criteria and learning theory. A combination with CS education could therefore advance it towards creating material that allows for self-empowerment of learners in a constructionist way that is also prevalent in current CS education and its research. We therefore conducted a systematic literature review and identified 34&nbsp;papers. First results show that there is a focus on programming and while all educational levels are included, there is a slight tendency towards primary school education. When looking at the specific mentions of the Montessori pedagogy, it is mostly used as a source of inspiration for, for example, creating CS teaching material. Within the results, first conclusions are drawn and finally, future work is suggested.},

abstract = {The common approach for introducing middle school and high school students to computational thinking and engineering is through programming or robotics activities that were designed without much social context. Therefore, one of the challenges such outreach programs pose is further stereotyping of students who are interested in computer science, by presenting them as people who ought to be hyper-intelligent and very much focused on computers with no social skills. Realizing the above, and wanting to attract a diverse audience to study computer science, we developed a one-day workshop which showcases the interdisciplinary nature of computer science and the various ways computing can help students discover and solve societal problems. We chose multiculturalism, cyber security and air pollution as the context of our computational thinking activities. This paper describes our experiences in developing and teaching the workshops that runs three to five times a year, hosted either in our institute or at local schools. Regardless of students' previous STEM experiences and socioeconomic statuses, both students and teachers reported that the knowledge gained enabled them to either create a computer program or a robot and also led to a better understanding of how computers can be used in daily life. In other words, the workshop successfully opened the minds and perspectives of the middle school and high school students on computer science. Additionally, over time, we also observed an increased number of students and schools participating in such workshops.},

abstract = {To aid in understanding the current climate of diversity and inclusion in the Computer Science Department at our university, we developed a survey to identify and evaluate factors related to these topics. The survey was administered before the third week of participating Spring 2024 courses, which ranged from introductory classes open to any student from any major, to advanced classes taken as part of the computer science major course sequence. Our findings show that students expressed feeling more confident in their potential for success in class versus as a future professional in the field. They reported more positive interactions with faculty than with peers. Students also indicated a desire for more structured opportunities to connect with peers, and commented positively on current departmental efforts to make our common areas more welcoming. The survey results provide a baseline that we can use in the future to evaluate the impact of curricular interventions on student perceptions of inclusion and belonging. We also plan to evaluate how enhanced support for student well-being in the department and within student groups impacts perceptions and retention of underrepresented groups.},

abstract = {Despite proliferated efforts to integrate computer science in elementary education, there is a dearth of studies that synthesize the current state of CS education research in formal educational contexts, specifically in upper elementary classrooms. Further, while numerous studies have investigated approaches and strategies that broaden participation in computing, the majority of them focus on secondary and post-secondary settings. The present study uses a systematic literature review process to review research conducted with students in formal classroom settings in grades 4, 5, and 6 and published since 2013. We review the research through two questions: What are barriers to broadening participation in CS in upper elementary (grades 4-6)? What instructional approaches and strategies help broaden participation in CS in upper elementary (grades 4-6)? A systematic search of the literature highlighted approaches used for broadening participation, including using various teaching media, designing scaffolds in instruction, and integrating into other subject areas. We conclude by identifying gaps in the research and identifying areas for further research.},

abstract = {As countries adopt computing education for all pupils from primary school upwards, there are challenging indicators: significant proportions of students who choose to study computing at universities fail the introductory courses, and the evidence for links between formal education outcomes and success in CS is limited. Yet, as we know, some students succeed without prior computing experience. Why is this?  Some argue for an innate ability, some for motivation, some for the discrepancies between the expectations of instructors and students, and some -- simply -- for how programming is being taught. All agree that becoming proficient in computing is not easy. Our research takes a novel view on the problem and argues that some of that success is influenced by early childhood experiences outside formal education. In this study, we analyzed over 1300 responses to a multi-institutional and multi-national survey that we developed. The survey captures enjoyment of early developmental activities such as childhood toys, games and pastimes between the ages 0 --- 8 as well as later life experiences with computing. We identify unifying features of the computing experiences in later life, and attempt to link these computing experiences to the childhood activities. The analysis indicates that computing proficiency should be seen from multiple viewpoints, including both skill-level and confidence. Our analysis is the first to show, we believe, that particular early childhood experiences are linked to parts of computing proficiency, namely those related to confidence with problem solving using computing technology. These are essential building blocks for more complex use. We recognize issues in the experimental design that may prevent our data showing a link between early activities and more complex computing skills, and suggest adjustments for future studies. Ultimately, we expect that this line of research will feed in to early years and primary education, and thereby improve computing education for all.},

abstract = {End-of-course evaluations and other student surveys typically include the opportunity for students to provide free-form comments. These are rich sources of data but are often only subjectively taken into account to further improve course delivery or analyze the effectiveness of assignments. We designed several puzzle-based assignments for typical CS1/2 topics and surveyed students as part of our efforts to analyze the assignments' efficacy and improve them over time. The surveys included traditional measures such as demographic data, Likert-scaled questions about assignment perceptions, and open-ended comments. With thousands of survey responses, we wanted to see if the open-ended comments yield additional, statistically significant, insights on either the assignments or students' learning. We developed a coding scheme for the comments using grounded theory analysis to represent patterns among the data. After refining the coding scheme we statistically analyzed the comments and found some interesting relationships, not apparent from the Likert-scaled questions, among certain codes. We also conducted extensive semi-structured interviews with instructors and student teaching assistants, also using grounded theory analysis to develop a set of codes for these different perspectives. The coding processes themselves allowed for a deeper understanding of the concerns about and appreciation for the assignments from both groups of participants. This poster reports on how the statistical results and the coding schemes, including the overlap and dissonance between the two coding schemes, inform our continued efforts to improve both assignment development and future research on the teaching and learning of CS concepts.},

abstract = {We believe teaching elementary school students to reason about programs is as important as teaching them to write programs. To facilitate development of this skill in young children one must choose a developmentally appropriate domain. Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab is a pattern-matching rule-based language whose semantics is significantly different than Scratch or Python. We chose Kodu because one can write non-trivial programs in two to four lines, and analyzing these programs is within the abilities of a typical 8 year old. Reasoning about programs requires students to understand the structure of code. The approach we're advocating is analogous to sentence diagramming, where one starts with a sequence of words and develops a representation of their syntactic and semantic relationships. One can similarly analyze Kodu programs by characterizing rules and recognizing relationships between rules. In this poster we describe "couplets", an analysis technique that reveals the presence within a program of an important Kodu design pattern called Pursue and Consume. Using this technique leads to accurate predictions about program behavior, and uncovers bugs if the pattern is not fully realized. As part of a study of 40 third graders who were learning Kodu, we provided brief instruction in the couplets technique. We found that they were able to apply couplets to 3-4 line programs and answer prediction questions with a roughly 85% success rate. Our results demonstrate that elementary school children can learn to reason abstractly about programs if given the right mental tools.},

abstract = {At McMaster University, we have developed a framework for teaching computer science, including curricula and tools (iPad apps: Image 2 Bits and ElmJr; an open-source library GraphicSVG; and a web-based development environment). ElmJr is a projectional editor for Elm, with knowledge of our graphics library. Using ElmJr, children transform programs through contextual menus. As a result, they never see syntax or type errors. Children as young as 10 years old, who have just started learning about syntax in English, can be productive programmers. We will explain how ElmJr is designed to make programming simple for beginners, and how strong typing in Elm and our graphics library is key to making the list of program transformations manageable. We will explain the design and findings of a study of children in 14 classes (grade 4 and 5) in the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board, who received 12 hours of instruction over eight weeks in ElmJr with the aim of improving their mathematics knowledge. In parallel, another eight grade 6 to 8 classes received at least two hours of instruction in Elm using our web-IDE, culminating in a Wordathon. The Wordathon is designed to reconcile the power of social computing with the need to protect children's privacy. The intermediate classes were challenged to create animations in Elm of assigned words identified by teachers as K-4 core reading vocabulary. Joining the intermediate students in this activity, two high school classes were taught how to create interactive applications in Elm and were challenged to create a reading game using the word animations created by the intermediate children. In all, four games incorporating 408 animations were created, and some of the intermediate students presented the games to primary grades in their schools. Unlike typical network effects, we get a multiplier effect: more word animations make game development more attractive, and more games make animations more attractive. Having a critical mass then attracts the attention of other educators, including in this case the team implementing the board-wide reading strategy. All of this can be accomplished without any identifying information leaving the classroom.},

abstract = {During the last years there have been intense discussions about how to include the acquisition of digital competencies in school education. The implementation is highly dependent on digitally-skilled educators. Currently, learning offers for a basic computing education of all teachers are needed and developed in many places. However, not much is known about computing competencies and conceptions of student and in-service teachers, who would take such courses. Also, there is a need of a proper test instrument measuring computing competencies that (student) teachers might possess not necessarily due to formal computing education but due to their everyday use of computing systems. Therefore, this project aims to create such a test instrument which measures competencies in the field of algorithm without testing explicit computing knowledge.},

abstract = {Basic computational thinking, so necessary in today's society, can be learned in an engaging way with the use of educational robots. In order to reach very diverse groups of people, educational robots need to be simple, scalable and low cost.Inspired by the success of the LOGO project, we have developed the Phogo pedagogical platform, built around a low cost robot (less than $80) capable of tracing its path with a marker pen. We also present a high-level Python-based control library that allows for transparent and easy wireless communication with the robots. The approach was tested in an informal workshop with a group of teenagers without any previous self-conscious computational knowledge. As the students were attracted by the robot and the simple approach, they were able to gain some insight about abstract programming concepts such as variables, functions, and flow control structures. The majority of the students were people with physical, cognitive or intellectual disabilities and they were able to follow, enjoy and learn as any other student making this an accessible activity to everyone.Finally, we summarize our efforts documenting and publishing the Phogo system as open-source in order to promote its use in future workshops.},

abstract = {This poster highlights a sociocultural analysis of a multifaceted K12 outreach program at New Mexico State University, a Hispanic Serving Institution that has had success recruiting local young women into the computer science department and beyond into the computing workforce. YWiC began in 2006 and has become a rich, extensive outreach program, reaching over 10,200 students across southern New Mexico. Over the years, YWiC has produced strong evaluation results related to computer science knowledge gains and computing interest (see Nesiba, et. Al 2015). The social scientists used Lave and Wenger's (1991) community of practice concept to analyze program design and implementation. Findings show four ways in which the program promotes individual agency, belonging to the local and global computing communities, and "positioning" (Davies and Harre, 1990) of young women as competent computer scientists. Specifically, YWiC: a) makes multiple pathways into computing education and computer science careers via intentional role modeling, b) provides common base knowledge through initial experiences and deep support from multiple role models, c) gives opportunities for young women to identify, and be identified by others as, competent in computing, and d) promotes belonging to a group of like-minded girls with multiple interests.},

abstract = {In this workshop, we will introduce you to a suite of Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) that have been shown to significantly improve student learning and achievement in introductory and advanced CS courses. CCEs address core aspects of computational thinking while exposing students to creative thinking skills, and can be adapted for use in your own courses. Activities such as writing a story in separate chapters and then merging the chapters to form a coherent whole, creating quilt-like patterns with written descriptions, or designing testing strategies for an alien health machine require students to apply computational thinking to unorthodox contexts and situations promoting creative application of CS knowledge and skills. CCEs are group-based, promote active learning, and are designed to foster collaborative problem solving necessary in today's workplace. They require no programming experience making them accessible to students including those with limited CS background and those with interests in non-CS disciplines, which can encourage more diverse participation in computing. Engage in a hands-on demo of a CCE and learn how to adapt CCEs for use in your classes, including technical support from the IC2Think Project team. Learn about the rigorous research studies behind the development, design and administration of these CCEs, including the instruments we used to evaluate the CCEs. Workshop session will include "how-to" presentations, panel-based Q&amp;A, breakout group discussions, and hands-on activities. Let's compute, create, and collaborate!},

abstract = {We describe a new introductory CS curriculum initiative that uses analogies and active engagement to develop students' conceptual understanding before applying the concepts to programming. We believe that traditional coding approaches to introducing computer science concepts rely on students to build their own conceptual understanding, rather than grounding their understanding of concepts in what they know from everyday experiences. Using constructivism as a foundation for this curriculum initiative, our approach builds a framework for student understanding anchored in the physical world using simple games and stories to stimulate mental engagement through embodied learning.For example, we teach the concept of abstraction and representation by presenting the game of Tic-Tac-Toe as an island divided into nine regions, but the middle one you cannot get to by boat, which is the way two teams arrive to the island. After playing the game once and realizing the game is really just Tic-Tac-Toe, the students understand the example is a representation with modified rules and game pieces. Then we talk about how the set of rules for a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe is an algorithm with instructions for how to play the game, and we use playing the game to explain computation as the execution of an algorithm.Based on observations using analogies and active engagement in 6th grade classrooms, we provide many examples explaining how this curriculum initiative is an engaging, effective, and flexible approach for introducing CS concepts.},

In this paper, we expand recent efforts to unfold what students should know about ML and how to design tools and activities allowing them to engage with ML. To do so, we explore how to make processes and aspects of ML tangible through the design of the Machine Learning Machine (MLM); a tangible user interface which enables students to create their own data-sets using pen and paper and to iteratively build and test ML models using this data. Based on insights from the design process and a preliminary pilot study with the MLM, we discuss how a tangible approach to engaging with ML can spur curiosity in students and how the iterative process of improving ML models can encourage students to reflect on the relation between data, model and predictions.},

Consequently, many countries around the world have updated their national pre-tertiary curriculum to include the topic of computing. However, the structure and presentation of these curricula varies greatly. This makes it difficult to compare the timing that students are exposed to computing and as a result, increases the difficulty for producing effective and well-timed educational resources that are relevant for varying implementations. This research investigates the structure of international computing curricula, identifying and comparing the timing that students are exposed to computing. This will better inform researchers and resource developers about where and when their interventions are most applicable. This will also provide valuable insights for the creation of future computing curricula, by informing curriculum designers about the perspectives of various curricula and the most common approaches they have taken.},

Block-based programming has emerged as an effective tool for engaging these novice learners in computational thinking. At the same time, digital storytelling has emerged as a promising avenue for creating motivating problem-solving scenarios that engage students in science investigations. Although block-based programming and digital storytelling are in many ways synergistic, there is a lingering question of how to design block-based languages at an age-appropriate level to enable effective and engaging storytelling. In this work, we review design principles from prior block-based and digital storytelling systems as well as propose the design of block-based programming language features to enable the creation of rich, interactive science narratives by upper elementary students.},

This helps students to build important high-level and meta-cognitive skills, and at a practical level provides students with projects that they can demonstrate to prospective employers after graduation.We discuss how these assessments were presented to students, and how the resulting student activities were aligned with learning objectives. We describe how complex ideas such as added value were explained to students, and how these assignments encouraged students to work on projects of ambition and substance, and to encourage their curiosity.Finally, we discuss some difficulties with this kind of assessment, and how we have endeavoured to tackle these difficulties. These include how such a diversity of assessments were marked fairly and consistently, how students who are struggling with the core module content can engage effectively, and how these kind of assessments can be devised without an excessive burden on teaching staff.},

abstract = {A revolution is taking place across Europe and worldwide in how we teach our children about computing, in primary and secondary school. Out goes ICT and how to use Microsoft Office; in comes coding and computer science. Assessment has a crucial role to play in this revolution. If teachers use low-quality assessment instruments we will end-up teaching the wrong subject; and viceversa. This paper reviews the state of the field, and makes concrete, achievable proposals for developing shared, high quality assessments for computer science. Central to this proposal is the collaborative platform VIVA (the Vilnius collaboratively coded and Validated computer science questions/tasks for Assess- ment). Two requirements are key to VIVA: 1) support for multiple competency frameworks, so that the contributors can meta-tag resources with respect to the framework they are most familiar with; and 2) support for crowdsourcing the validation of each question/task and its mapping to competencies. The use of a taxonomy of questions/tasks type that has been mapped to computational thinking concepts and to a competency framework is proposed. Some seed questions are already available in the online platform prototype, and various supporters have granted permission to use large questions banks. The design requirements of a full implementation of the VIVA platform for a modern and effective approach to assessment including support for digital badges, are outlined; and some preliminary results from a survey administered to the initial contributors to VIVA are presented.},

abstract = {While preparing students for careers upon graduation, faculty often have to manage the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness. The prioritization of these tasks is influenced by discipline and industry specific guidelines and does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery of the tool. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This presentation seeks to challenge the notion that the use of version control systems improves HBCU students' computational thinking (CT) skills and in turn prepares them for careers beyond graduation. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.},

abstract = {To successfully bring introductory computing to non-CS majors, one needs to create a curriculum that will appeal to students from diverse disciplines. Several educational theories emphasize the need for introductory contexts that align with students' long-term goals and are perceived as useful. Data Science, using algorithms to manipulate real-world data and interpreting the results, has emerged as a field with cross-disciplinary value, and has strong potential as an appealing context for introductory computing courses. However, it is not easy to find, clean, and integrate datasets that will satisfy a broad variety of learners. The CORGIS project (https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis) enables instructors to easily incorporate data science into their classroom. Specifically, it provides over 40 datasets in areas including history, politics, medicine, and education. Additionally, the CORGIS infrastructure supports the integration of new datasets with simple libraries for Java, Python, and Racket, thus empowering introductory students to write programs that manipulate real data. Finally, the CORGIS web-based tools allow learners to visualize and explore datasets without programming, enabling data science lessons on day one. We have incorporated CORGIS assignments into an introductory course for non-majors to study their impact on learners' motivation, with positive initial results. These results indicate that external adopters are likely to find the CORGIS tools and materials useful in their own pedagogical pursuits.},

abstract = {Bricklayer is a freely-available online educational ecosystem designed in accordance with a "low-threshold infinite-ceiling" philosophy. Its purpose is to teach coding to people of all ages and coding backgrounds. A significant portion of the Bricklayer ecosystem has been developed specifically to help novices, especially primary school children, learn how to code. When executed, Bricklayer programs can produce LEGO® artifacts, Minecraft artifacts, and even artifacts suitable for 3D printing. Bricklayer resides in a domain in which there is a strong connection between math, art, and computer science. This workshop is suitable for (1) university instructors and faculty who are interested in freshmen-level programming, (2) CS educators who work with and/or teach K-12 teachers in order to deliver coding-based curricula, (2) K-12 teachers and facilitators interested in exploring options for how they might teach coding - either directly as part of the in-school curriculum, or indirectly as part of an after school program.No background in coding is assumed. The aim of the workshop is to provide participants with a general understanding of what Bricklayer coding entails, how it relates to math, as well as providing a framework and road map for learning how to code in Bricklayer. An example of a 10 week (1 hour/week) primary school curriculum will be provided.},

abstract = {Computer Science was introduced in the upper secondary curriculum in Ireland in 2018. Initially introduced in 40 pilot schools, it has since expanded and is currently offered in approximately one-third of all schools across the country. Given its recent introduction, it was important to understand the students’ experiences and perceptions of the subject. This study reports on students’ experiences of studying Computer Science in a sample of secondary schools. A qualitative approach was adopted to comprehensively capture students’ insights, including one-to-one semi-structured interviews and other data collection methods that collected student-generated data. The study found that students had positive experiences and perceptions of the subject. Students enjoyed the active and interactive way Computer Science was taught and appreciated the peer learning opportunities that it provided. Students reported developing skills such as creativity, problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration through the active learning approach. The project-based learning, afforded by the Applied Learning Tasks, was welcomed by students, although it also presented a number of challenges. Students opposed the prevalent stereotypical views of Computer Science, claiming that the subject was suitable for all, regardless of gender, prior knowledge, or abilities. The subject was considered relevant not only for those pursuing a career in Computer Science but for all students, as it acted as a vehicle to developing an understanding of the technology-rich society and foster valuable 21st century skills.},

abstract = {Objectives. Athletics and sports represent a focal part of adolescence for millions of youth around the world. However, opportunities to engage in computer science learning experiences are less prevalent, particularly among Hispanic and low-income communities. Recently, researchers have explored ways to bridge these, seemingly, disparate disciplines. Much of this prior research centers on the proliferation of sports technologies that support individualistic learning experiences. Additionally, many of these experiences are developed by researchers with limited design contributions from sports practitioners. To extend prior work, this project centers youth athletic identities and the associated cultural contexts of sports to explore ways that computing technologies can enhance and develop youth athletic identities and sports performance. Moreover, this work surfaces ways that athletics can be a generative and fulfilling space to learn about computer science.Participants. In summer 2021, we collaborated with basketball coaches to design and implement a computing-enhanced learning experience with a basketball team of Hispanic participants in Puerto Rico. Eleven basketball athletes from a high school in southern Puerto Rico participated in the study. The participants have strong sports identities, as demonstrated by their lifelong engagement with team sports. Conversely, only one out of the eleven participants had experienced sports technologies, and none of them had previously participated in computing learning experiences.Study Method. In collaboration with local basketball coaches, we co-designed a learning experience that centers sports identities and practices and adds computing as a way to extend existing sports identities and local sports activities. We present and evaluate this learning experience using a design-based research approach. Participants’ feedback was collected in the form of surveys, designs, and journal entries, and additional data on their experiences were collected via videos and researchers’ field notes. Using a mixed-methods approach, we highlight existing participants’ identities and perceptions as well as their experiences with our design. We complement quantitative analysis of survey responses with case studies.Findings. We find that our design can provide shifts in youth student-athletes’ perceptions of computing. Additionally, hands-on experiences with computing tools enable participants to start practicing computer science sensemaking via learning how different computing tools can support their sports performance individually and as a team. Furthermore, we find that the material, ideational and relational resources made available through camp:bit supported each participant differently, while collectively providing a space for all of them to have meaningful and fulfilling experiences. Finally, we find that this design can foster and support sports team cohesion.Conclusions. We provide in-depth descriptions of our design, the youth’s engagement with it, and how these learning experiences can be further applied in sports spaces. These examples highlight a unique conception of practice-linked computational identities—where learners’ computational identities are grounded in a specific culturally relevant practice, enabling a more culturally sustaining computing learning experience. Finally, our analysis suggests five design principles for designing and conducting computing-supported learning experiences in sports environments. The principles are as follows: 1. Sports Experience: Authentically Support Existing Identities. 2. Team Dynamics: Team Athletes are Part of a Whole. 3. Individual Pursuits: Supporting Individual Paths. 4. Direct Interactions: Conversations with Materials and Ideas. 5. Interdisciplinary Facilitation Team: Complementary Skills. These design principles can be used by researchers, practitioners, and local stakeholders to implement sport-centric CS learning experiences to extend and enhance the way student-athletes from marginalized communities practice sports, as well as to activate interest and engagement in CS.},

abstract = {Digital photographs are part of liberal arts students' classes (e.g., art, history, and production classes in film and television) and their daily smartphone-based life, in apps like Instagram and Snapchat. Building image filters can be a relevant and engaging context into using computing for humanities students. We have designed a new course for introducing computing in terms of creative expression. We use a scaffolded sequence of programming languages and activities to explore computing on photographs: (a) a teaspoon language for generating image filters, (b) a set of custom Snap blocks for even more sophisticated image filters, and (c) an ebook activity for mapping from Snap to Python. Each stage takes less than 10 minutes to introduce, with a wide variety of possible student activities (for in-class active learning or for later homework). While the tools build on each other, the earliest stage (the teaspoon language) could be used within a single class session in other liberal arts courses.},

abstract = {Understanding issues of intersectionality in education is vital for creating equitable learning environments. Intersectionality emphasizes the complexity of students' identities, including race, gender, and socioeconomic status, and how they interact to characterize their diverse group membership. Examining data intersectionality underscores students' heterogeneous needs, circumstances, and outcomes, advancing researchers' and policymakers' understanding of the types of interventions that ameliorate disparities for marginalized students. This study examines the intersectional factors influencing K-2 students' coding skills. We employ a hierarchical linear model on a validated pre-and-post coding assessment to examine a year-long Coding as Another Language curriculum for Latine, multilingual, and low-socioeconomic students. Findings indicated initial performance gaps for students with historically marginalized and intersecting backgrounds. After receiving the curriculum, these students demonstrated significant improvement, closing the coding skills gap with their more privileged peers. These findings underscore the importance of investigating and mitigating disparities in coding education for students with intersecting identities.},

abstract = {There is growing momentum to integrate computer science (CS) education across K-12, but there is little information about how this integration should take place (Grover &amp; Pea, 2013). This is especially true in the elementary grades, as fewer studies have examined computing at these grades. Through a National Science Foundation STEM+C project, we are developing and studying learning progressions for integrated CS and mathematics at the elementary level. Our research examines how teachers are introducing CS concepts within mathematic as well as what computational concepts and practices naturally can be taught within the context of elementary mathematics. We are also examining how these emerging progressions align with the K-12 CS Framework and the new standards from the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA). Future aims are to develop a coherent set of learning progressions related to areas such as debugging, sequencing, looping, conditionals, and decomposition within mathematics topics such as geometry, fractions, and arithmetic number stories. Our research lays the groundwork for the development of learning trajectories that will guide curriculum developers and practitioners to understand how to teach students across grades K-5 computing within the context of their mathematics instruction.},

There was a point in time when CS education involved perspectives of computational learning, commensurate with the thinking that software and hardware could be used to solve problems in multiple knowledge domains (such as in library science). When faced with low enrollment and interest of women and minorities in CS education, there was an impetus on encouraging diversity in CS education, leading to diversity-inclusive CS instruction.},

abstract = {Computer Science and programming are being introduced to school curricula in many western countries in an effort to equip students with Computational Thinking skills. However, as these subjects are still relatively new to pre-tertiary education there is much investigation to be done into how best to present these topics and how to prepare teachers. In this study we focus on the presentation of topics relating to computing, Computational Thinking, and Computer Science for primary schools.We analyse English-language curricula that have been published, specifically the English, Australian and CSTA curricula for primary schools. From this we establish the main topics covered, and how they are positioned to be suitable for students from the first year of school to approximately their eighth year.We then report on a pilot study of a curriculum based on Computational Thinking; long term the study will encompass a range of topics and year levels, but the pilot focused on topics suitable for 11 to 12 year old students. Here we detail the design of this part of the curriculum, the manner of its delivery, and the experiences and observations of the generalist teacher who taught the course. Through assessment data, student responses to an attitude survey, and class observations we have evaluated the pilot curriculum. The findings of this study are being used to inform the design of a planned larger scale study.},

The Indian Education for All (IEFA) Act, passed in 1999, reinforces the educational goals stated in Montana's 1972 Constitution that "every Montanan, whether Indian or non-Indian, be encouraged to learn about the distinct and unique heritage of American Indians in a culturally responsive manner." IEFA requires that American Indian education be integrated into "the education of each Montana citizen," making Montana the only state to mandate Indian education by law. We propose an integration of CS concepts into existing content standards using the IEFA curricula. To make these concepts approachable, we utilize Alice, a drag-and-drop programming environment. This software allows students to animate stories while learning programming techniques in a user-friendly way. Furthermore, Alice 2 allows customized models; in particular, we can create models specific to American Indian culture. In this poster, we present an overview of the Storytelling project and preliminary results, an example lesson plan, evaluation techniques, and a description of the 3D model creation process. With these lesson plans and customized models, we strive to broaden participation of students from rural and American Indian communities in CS and related fields.},

The project is aimed at improving the attitudes and computational thinking skills for African American elementary school children in the 3rd to 5th grades and to understand their difficulties in reasoning about code. This was done within the context of a five-week summer camp. There were 40 children of whom about half were females. Along with instruction, we used a custom video game to teach code tracing. We used video game data and pre and posttests to assess students' performance. Qualitative and quantitative results from our mixed method design show cognitive and affective improvements as well as improvements in computational thinking skills. The data we collected also highlighted potential common mistakes that elementary school children might make as they attempt to reason about code. It shows the potential in games to motivate code understanding practice and improve learning.

abstract = {This lighting talk discusses the potential for using coding as a new means of self-expression. Coding has been identified as a key 21st-century skill, and as such, it is expected to be vastly acquired already in the early ages of formal education. Coding is a language that adheres to a system of symbols and rules, which, when combined, convey meaning. This postulation has led a few scholars to sustain that coding is a language functioning like any other language. Thus, coding might enable its coders to produce expressive artifacts, similarly to any other natural language, potentially offering a new form of creative writing in the 21st century. A celebrated use of creative writing is in the field of emotional therapy. Writing has been proven an efficient tool in both clinical and non-clinical populations. Nevertheless, despite its effectiveness, some populations are deprived of the great benefits creative writing may enable. Among these are children who do not know how to read and write, as well as adults who struggle with expressive writing. Therefore, we suggest a way for expanding the boundaries of coding to the field of self-expressive writing. We believe that apart from promoting its acquisition as an essential tool in the 21st century, knowing coding at an early age may also endorse general well-being, offering a new, somewhat more reachable, means of self-expression.},

abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a form of computational modeling whereby a phenomenon is modeled in terms of agents and their interactions. By looking at scientific phenomenon using ABMs, students can learn to understand the micro interactions that are responsible for so many of the seemingly complex systems in the world around them. In addition, by integrating CT skills into science classrooms, we can simultaneously broaden participation in computing, provide a more authentic scientific experience for learners, and encourage deeper scientific content learning. In this hands-on workshop, we introduce participants to two parallel agent-based modeling environments: NetTango (Olson &amp; Horn, 2011), a blocks-based language, and NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999), a text-based language. The workshop will focus on contextualizing agent-based modeling activities within high school STEM classrooms, allowing participants to explore how computer science can be integrated into existing high school STEM curricula. Over the course of the workshop, participants will gain first-hand experience with ABM and how to design ABM activities in classrooms using NetTango and NetLogo. In addition, the workshop will feature open discussions in which participants will discuss the learning trajectories and affordances of the different programming modalities, brainstorm models that could be built for student exploration, and design activities that incorporate both scientific and computer science content for existing curricula.},

abstract = {Students are nowadays being introduced to the digital age as part of their formal education. This includes practical programming skills as well as more conceptual thinking tools developed in the discipline of computer science, sometimes denoted Computational Thinking (CT). The connection between CT and doing programming is sometimes thought of as the connection between theory and practice. The pragmatic thinker Dewey embraced practice in learning and argued that learning and knowing always come from experiencing the world. According to this view, there are no epistemological differences between theory and practice. In computer programming the student's active learning in the form of physical motor movement is important. Using the pragmatic way of analyzing learning to program puts a focus on the situated thinking during the practical programming, which relates to theories about CT. This research is focusing on the practical hands-on part of novice programming and in this aims at getting insights about factors important when learning to program that could inform teachers in the Computer Science classroom.},

abstract = {The inventors of the term "computer science" meant for it to be something that was taught to everyone, to facilitate learning other subjects, and to help people understand the risks of technology in their lives. Alan Perlis (with Newell and Simon) published the first definition of "computer science" in Science in 1967 [6]. In 1961, he argued at MIT that everyone at the academia should learn to program, to give them a new way to understand their world [10]. At the same event, C.P. Snow (author of The Two Cultures [11]) argued that we should teach everyone about computing so that they would understand the dangers in our new computerized society [12]. He wrote: "A handful of people, having no relation to the will of society, having no communication with the rest of society, will be taking decisions in secret which are going to affect our lives in the deepest sense."The world today relies on information technology but, we mostly teach IT to people who will become professionals. This leaves us with only a privileged class that understands a critical part of our world. If we want to reach the original and more general goal, we will have to change how we teach about computing. With my students and collaborators, I have been identifying the barriers to giving everyone an understanding of the computing technology in their world.We have explored how socioeconomic status influences success in computing [9], and how increasing access to high school computing courses has not led to a commensurate increase in the number or diversity fo students taking those courses [7, 8]. We have been studying why students reject computer science [1], and how to invent new forms of computing education that meet the needs of students who have not succeeded in traditional computing courses [2]. In our most recent work, we ask questions like "What are fundamental ideas of computing that everyone needs to reason about and use the computational technologies in their world?" and "How can we re-design computation to make it more approachable, accessible, and adoptable?"

Referencing Epstein's Generativity Theory, we designed and deployed a suite of creative thinking exercises with linkages to concepts in computer science and computational thinking, with the premise that students can leverage their creative thinking skills to "unlock" their understanding of computational thinking. In this paper, we focus on our study on differential impacts of the exercises on different student populations. For all students there was a linear "dosage effect" where completion of each additional exercise increased retention of course content. The impacts on course grades, however, were more nuanced. CS majors had a consistent increase for each exercise, while non-majors benefited more from completing at least three exercises. It was also important for freshmen to complete all four exercises. We did find differences between women and men but cannot draw conclusions.},

abstract = {As society increasingly relies on digital technologies in many different aspects, those who lack relevant access and skills are lagging increasingly behind. Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, women-in-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 women-in-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants’ feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations.},

This underrepresentation also restricts access to career paths that can enhance social mobility, particularly for women in developing countries. Physical computing offers a hands-on approach that can improve programming skills and computational thinking through interaction with tangible hardware. This research focuses on developing a short physical computing workshop tailored to young girls from low-income communities. The study combines education, tangible interfaces, and coding. Through a series of classroom-based studies and laboratory experiments, this PhD work will assess the impact of the workshop on self-efficacy and learning in programming and computational thinking. The anticipated contributions of this research include insights into the effectiveness of tangible, user-friendly physical computing workshops in increasing engagement among underrepresented groups in computer science.},

abstract = {Since autumn 2018, teachers throughout Sweden are obliged to relate to programming in one way or another in the teaching, especially in the subject of mathematics and technology education. Although teachers should formally work with programming teaching from the autumn of 2018, programming has been taught in primary school for several years. While there is some research on younger students, most of the research has almost exclusively focused on didactic approaches and strategies used by teachers, educational values and practices that accompany programming teaching, and views of teachers regarding programming teaching. What is still missing is research that highlights how younger students experience these new practices and how they primarily perceive programming in traditional school subjects, such as mathematics. Thus, this paper reports on a thematic analysis of younger students' (n=44) perceptions of programming; students who have been introduced to and been taught programming in mathematics in grade 5.},

abstract = {Computing education practitioners and researchers know a lot about how to design courses for students who are going to pursue a career in computing (e.g., professional software developer, data scientist, or computer engineer). Today, computing is a necessary part of other careers, such as scientists who create computational models and simulations, artists working in computational media, and critical computing scholars. The University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) charged a task force with defining the computing education needs for their students. The task force conducted a year long process involving searches of courses and programs, interviews with students and faculty, and a large survey. The task force proposed themes of Computing for Discovery, Expression, and Justice as useful in organizing computing within the liberal arts and sciences. We are now designing the introductory courses for expression and justice. We are using participatory design methods where faculty advisors engage in tasks (like card sorting) to define projects and learning goals. The expression and justice card sorts are markedly different. We are planning to use a block-based language (Snap!) for instruction and homework, but students will also engage with a purpose-built Runestone ebook in a textual language like Processing (for expression), and Python and HTML (for justice). The ebook activities are informed by purpose-first programming in order to support transfer of knowledge and to encourage a sense of self-efficacy and authenticity.},

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in broadening participation in computer science is teacher preparation, as few middle and high school teachers have a formal background in computing. Further, without a credentialing program, there are limited ways to learn content and pedagogical strategies for effective computer science instruction. As a result, professional development is key to successful reform in the teaching of computer science. In this paper, we describe our three-pronged approach to the design of a professional development model for middle and high school teachers interested in implementing the Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum in their classrooms or infusing CSP modules into STEM curricula. We describe our model focusing on content, pedagogical strategies and follow-up classroom support during the academic year. We subsequently report on participating teacher outcomes, in terms of self-rated understandings, attitudes and implementation practices. We share lessons learned and offer recommendations for professional development designers.},

Existing ML learning tools focus primarily on the first two areas, and to a lesser degree the third. In order to address this, we designed VotestratesML; a tool allowing K-12 students to build models and make predictions based on real world voting data. Based on in-situ deployments of VotestratesML, we reflect on opportunities and challenges for engaging K-12 students in understanding and reflecting on ML. We find that the design of VotestratesML supports students’ engagement in all three areas of ML, through grounding ML in a known subject area and allowing for collaboration and competition.},

It also provides an engaging context in which to learn computational thinking skills in existing classroom contexts. For my dissertation research, I will explore whether and how data science can support inquiry-based learning in social studies. I conjecture that data science could provide students with an opportunity to use computational thinking to better understand their social world, while also allowing students to draw from and make sense of their own experiences. I plan to explore this idea by enhancing and evaluating a software tool, Local Ground, and creating a curriculum that helps young people identify and describe salient characteristics of their lived realities, moving from unstructured to structured data representations (e.g., photos to tags to databases). This process may generate a rich, motivating data source to explore subsequent ideas in computational thinking and social science.},

abstract = {With the increasing interest and enrollment in programming courses, educators must discover innovative and inclusive teaching methods to effectively cater to diverse learner needs and varying levels of prior knowledge. Introductory programming courses (CS1) can prove arduous for novices and insufficiently stimulating for those with experience, creating an educational dilemma. Striking a balance between students' expectations and engagement becomes challenging for educators, especially given the expanding pre-higher education CS exposure.To tackle this challenge, offering optional extra practice opportunities could aid students in mastering concepts, particularly those benefitting from rigorous practice. However, personal motivation and other factors may hinder their engagement, undermining potential benefits. To enhance engagement, providing a minor amount of extra credit as an extrinsic incentive might be effective.In this context, students' engagement with extra credit quizzes (ECQs) is influenced by various factors, with self-regulation and time management playing a pivotal role. This study delves into the correlation between students' weekly ECQ submission time and their total quiz interactions. Specifically, it examines whether the timing of weekly ECQ submissions varies based on the number of quizzes engaged. The analysis also explores group discrepancies in submission times, considering factors like gender and prior programming experience (PPE) relative to ECQ engagement. Ultimately, these insights could reshape educational approaches to better address student needs.},

Specifically, we examine how the design features of the toys and kits represent the concepts of rotation on a point and spatial orientation of the agent. We examine toys and kits sold commercially, developed through research, and used in early childhood classrooms. Our findings indicate that the mathematical and spatial concepts are overlooked in some designs. Prior research examined toys for their affordances related to computational thinking, the present study contributes to understanding of how these toys and kits have the potential to foster foundational mathematics and spatial skills. We discuss implications for design of toys and kits as well as recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {A recent evolution of cloud-based tools creates an easy and powerful way for students to access the industry standard data science tools from within a browser window. Jupyter notebooks were originally developed for sharing of scientific results and reproducible open science. However, when delivered through a cloud-based server, they have huge benefits for teaching, including removing the need to install any software locally or require any specific machine to be used by students. UC Berkeley has extensive experience teaching via Jupyter, including the popular introductory Data 8 course, small Data Science Modules in non- Data Science classes, and advanced work in the Data 100 and Data 102 ( Machine Learning) classes. There is a library of OER curricular materials to share between institutions. In addition, Multiple languages and interfaces can be served, from Jupyter in multiple languages, Rstudio, and even a Linux desktop, as well as auto-grading approaches. We are interested to share experiences across institutions utilizing this approach.The use of teaching Jupyterhubs to date, both for introductory to Data Science courses, as well as more advanced topics is growing rapidly. We would like to have a conversation about how to use Jupyterhubs and teaching Jupyter notebooks from a variety of instructors and institutions. We are also interested in how to provide these types of resources to additional educational settings who may be more resource constrained.},

Without proper structure and practical application, these workshops can result in shallow learning, making it difficult for participants to apply their skills in real-world situations. To fill the existing gap in academic research, this paper presents a structured set of patterns aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of coding workshops. The presented patterns, derived from hands-on experiences within the ”Coding Culture in Oberberg” research project, address various stages of a workshop. Though initially designed for young learners aged 11-13, the patterns are adaptable across different age groups. This collection serves as a guide for educators and workshop facilitators looking to create more interactive, practical, and engaging coding experiences.},

abstract = {The hardship students face when beginning to problem solve can lessen motivation and confidence in their programming ability. An initial mitigation step is to explore students’ mindsets when first approaching a programming task, and distinguish between correct/incorrect models of problem-solving. This will help researchers and instructors realize what methods and tools can scaffold students’ problem-solving skill development in programming classrooms. Our goal is to uncover this information by investigating successful problem-solving approaches across the computing and math domains, and exploring whether it is possible to transfer a successful approach from math to the computing domain. We also explore whether students can apply a successful problem-solving strategy, such as problem decomposition, after being reminded or taught that such a strategy exists. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with high-school students solving math and programming problems. Our data analysis reveals a number of problem-solving strategies in both programming and math, highlights their differences, and demonstrates the transfer problem-solving benefits across domains. We also found that simply instructing students how to apply a problem-solving strategy does not ensure its application. Overall, this research highlights the need to design tools that teach students how to apply successful problem-solving strategies.},

abstract = {Computer science is poised to become a core discipline in K12 education, however there are unresolved tensions between the definitions and purposes of computer science and public education. This study's goal is to explore how logistical and conceptual challenges emerge while designing a comprehensive K12 computer science program in a public school district. While the policy infrastructure for K12 computer science education is rapidly developing, few districts have yet implemented computer science as a core discipline in their K12 programs and very little research has explored the challenges involved in putting ideas into practice. This study reports on a committee designing a comprehensive K12 computer science education program at a small public school district in California. Through a grounded-theory qualitative interpretation of committee-member interviews and board meeting transcripts, we surfaced three themes which were the primary points of tension: how computer science is defined, how it ought to be taught, and what process ought to be used to answer these questions. Grounding these tensions in the academic discourse on K12 computer science education, this study offers recommendations to other districts designing comprehensive computer science education and suggests future directions of computer science education research that will be most useful to stakeholders of these processes.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a simple but innovative assignment technique, the "How-To" as a way to simplify the relationship with AI in assessment events. As an assignment, the "How-To" guide merges reflective practice with technical skill development in technical or creative fields, inviting students to author a guide based on insights from prior coursework, personal projects or specific directed challenges. This method emphasizes reciprocal learning by engaging students in a reflective process where they must articulate and analyze their technical learning, thus reinforcing their understanding and evidencing their mastery of the given learning outcome. This technique could be more broadly applicable, building on the large success of online how-to tutorials; but in flipping the emphasis from passive consumption to productive engagement, the discussed assignment encourages a blend of narrative, technical detail, and creative expression, culminating in a resource that benefits both the author, their peers and potentially course development itself. This presentation will explore how the assignment’s framework develops as an extension of the principle of ‘ako’, a Mundefinedori concept emphasizing reciprocal learning. The discussion will focus on its application within the specific educational context of Aotearoa New Zealand and the broader value it offers to creative and technical education.},

abstract = {Several institutions have recently introduced Introduction to Data Science courses that involve a substantial programming component and do not require CS1 as a prerequisite. Programming and computational thinking are central to the emerging discipline of data science, and so there is overlap between traditional CS1 courses and Introduction to DS.Partly because of the evident societal significance of data science and because data science does not have the problematic reputation of computer science, Intro to DS can attract new and diverse audiences that may not have been interested in taking CS1.We explore Intro to DS as a possible alternative path into computing: what are the learning goals in Intro to DS that involve programming and/or computational thinking? How generalizable are the problems students solve in Intro to DS to what students would encounter in future studies? Is it feasible for students to pursue a data science sequence rather than CS1-CS2 and be prepared for a career that uses data science? To what extent can a pathway through a data science sequence diversify the population of students who graduate from degree programs in computer science and data science?We survey the Introduction to Data Science courses offered in North American post-secondary education, and focus on a data science sequence that uses the R programming language and does not require CS1 at an R1 institution as a case study.},

abstract = {Since students are familiar with machine learning (ML)-based applications in their everyday lives, they already construct mental models of how these systems work. This can result in misconceptions that influence the learning of correct ML concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the misconceptions students hold about the functionality of ML-based applications. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five students, focusing on their understanding of facial recognition and ChatGPT. The interviews were analyzed using an inductively developed code system and qualitative content analysis. This process identified six key misconceptions held by students: “Programmed Behavior,” “Exactness,” “Data Storage,” “Continuous Learning,” “User-trained Model,” and “Autonomous Data Acquisition”. These misconceptions include the notion that AI learns continuously during application, or that training data is saved and reused later. This paper presents the identified misconceptions and discusses their implication for the design and evaluation of effective learning activities in the context of ML.},

Subgoal labels are used to group the steps of worked examples into cohesive units that may help the learner to identify key information about the process. We conducted a study on the applicability of subgoal labeled worked examples with 9 and 10-year-old pupils (n=43) who were learning the principles of programming using LightBot. Using a between groups design, pupils in three classes were working with LightBot. One of the groups had no additional instructional materials for the LightBot environment, one of the groups had a set of worked examples without subgoal labels, and the last group had the same set of worked examples with subgoal labels. We measured pupils' success in terms of how many LightBot levels they completed during the class. In addition, pupils' beliefs and attitudes towards programming were assessed before and after the experiment. Our results indicate that in a programming environment such as LightBot, simple worked examples provide no significant benefit over no examples, but worked examples with subgoal labels can help pupils complete more levels. At the same time, the instructional materials in the study had no significant influence on the pupils' beliefs towards computer use or programming.},

Free-choice, open-ended projects are encouraged to promote learner agency and leverage the affordances of these novice-programming environments that also support creative engagement in CS. This mixed methods research examines what we can learn about student learning from such programming artifacts. Using an extensive rubric created to evaluate these projects along several dimensions, we coded a sample of ~80 Scratch and App Inventor projects randomly selected from 20 middle school classrooms in a diverse urban school district in the US. We present key elements of our rubric, and report on noteworthy trends including the types of artifacts created and which key programming constructs are or are not commonly used. We also report on how factors such as students' gender, grade, and teachers' teaching experience influenced students' projects. We discuss differences between programming environments in terms of artifacts created, use of computing constructs, complexity of projects, and use of features of the environment for creativity, interactivity, and engagement. Our findings will help educators of introductory computing be more cognizant of how best to leverage the programming environments they are using, and what aspects they need to focus on as they attempt to address the learning needs of all in "CS For All."},

abstract = {New breakthroughs in code synthesis from Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model (LLM) algorithms are driving significant changes to software engineering education. Having algorithms able to generate components of a software project means that software developers will need stronger skills in requirements specification to guide code generation as well as stronger skills in code review, testing, and integration to incorporate AI-generated code into projects. Shifts in industry and classroom practices are already occurring with the availability of inline code generation tools like GitHub's Copilot, which makes discussion of pedagogical strategies in this area a timely topic. Of immediate concern in computer science education is the potential for LLM-generated code and code help to undermine the learning of CS students. In order to avoid such undermining in even intentional uses of LLM-enhanced learning supports, it is necessary to clarify the roles such supports need to play in the pedagogical process. The Computer Science Matrix Taxonomy provides a strong framework for organizing software testing learning outcomes as well as delineating the operational space in which LLM-based feedback tools should operate to support those learning outcomes. In this paper, the authors operationalize the CS Matrix Taxonomy for software testing learning outcomes and illustrate the integration of LLM-generated test strategy suggestions as an extension of the peer coding/testing model. The work includes examples of AI-generated code testing suggestions that students would use to help guide their own code synthesis for assignments or projects.},

Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) is one such strategy with a proven history across STEM disciplines. The CS POGIL community has grown rapidly over the past decade thanks to NSF support of multiple grants of educational research in Computer Science using this strategy; hundreds of CS teachers and professors have attended POGIL workshops to learn more about using and developing POGIL materials. A survey of CS POGIL practitioners found that instructors believe their students learn more, are more engaged and active, and develop better communication skills in POGIL classrooms [1]. The survey also found that obstacles include limited time, a lack of relevant materials, pressure to cover content, difficulty adapting teaching style, and resistance from students. Workshops like this one can help practitioners to answer these questions and to adopt POGIL more effectively and efficiently. This workshop is based on materials developed and used extensively by The POGIL Project (http://pogil.org).},

abstract = {Over the last few years, researchers, teachers, parents, volunteers, and even IT companies have joined efforts to develop coding activities for children in K-12 education. These efforts include technological tools and programming environments as well as activities descriptions. Kodel\o{}ypa is a coding activity offered by NTNU, which focuses on engaging teens in creative programming. In this paper, we report about the design and implementation of an empirical investigation with 13 teachers who attended Kodel\o{}ypa as associated school teachers of the pupils from their respective schools. In this study, we have addressed the following research question: What are the teachers' understandings of coding activities for teens outside the schools? The goal of this study was to identify various factors that will help us to acquire knowledge on this important kind of stakeholders, and improve the design and implementation of Kodel\o{}ypa and other similar efforts. We have conducted a thematic analysis with the data and we expect the results of this study will help teachers and researchers to design and organize computer science learning activities more efficiently and collaboratively.},

abstract = {Student engagement has been shown to increase academic achievement. We apply learning engagement strategies in introductory computer science courses using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones. Using programming to control and fly drones reinforces the basic concepts of programming in an interesting and enjoyable way for first year programming students in a CS1 course. Additionally, we apply similar but less technical engagement strategies in a general education course with no prerequisites, and engage students with issues in modern technology through the medium of drones. Many in higher education see the introduction of complex topics as an important method of engaging students and therefore of improving learning outcomes. This leads many to offer courses in areas like robotics, AI, and game development. A potential problem with this approach is the level of knowledge required for these courses precludes their use as an engagement strategy in introductory coursework where they might attract the attention of a broader set of students. To this end we looked into adding drone technology to introductory and non-major CS courses. While preliminary, these results suggest a high level of student interest in the topic and promising engagement from both CS major and non-CS-major students.},

The Wearable Learning Games Engine is web based infrastructure that enables students to carry one mobile device per child, as they embark on math team-based activities that require physical engagement with the environment. These Wearable Tutors serve as guides and assistants while students manipulate, measure, estimate, discern, discard and find mathematical objects that satisfy specified constraints. Multi-player math games that use this infrastructure have yielded both cognitive and affective benefits. Beyond math game play, the Wearable Games Engine Authoring Tool enables students to create games themselves for other students to play; in this process, students engage in computational thinking and learn about finite-state machines. We present the infrastructure, games, and results for a series of experiments on both game play and game creation.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of social media among ever younger children, there is a growing need to educate young learners about the key concepts and mechanisms related to data collection, profiling, and content recommendation on online platforms. This paper presents a gamified K–9 classroom activity where learners analyze data traces to construct and iteratively refine detailed profiles of a mystery online person, thereby learning to recognize the digital traces typical of online interactions. Using data from 163 fifth- and eighth-grade students collected over 11 game sessions, the results demonstrate that the majority of learners were able to analyze and integrate various data traces to assemble coherent profiles, showing an emerging competence in recognizing data collection and profiling in online interactions, including their ubiquity, multimodality, and their consequences. The results also reveal that the learners’ ability to critically reflect on profiling is still developing. This paper contributes to the fields of AI education and social media literacy by demonstrating the feasibility of early education on social media mechanisms.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a problem solving approach that is becoming prominent in educational settings. To help ease students into the world of programming, visual programming tools such as Scratch are used. Researchers are also developing various tools in an attempt to assess students' proficiency in thought processes that make up CT. However, current existing tools mainly utilize students' final code products when evaluating their demonstration of CT, losing their opportunity to understand students' actual learning and programming procedures. This work presents a logging methodology that records programming actions of students in the Scratch block coding environment to enable an in-depth analysis of students' programming process. With this logging methodology, we conducted a case study with introductory programmers to study how the logs of students' programming processes can provide insight into how they practice CT during programming.},

abstract = {SciGirls Code is a project which used the principles of connected learning with 16 STEM outreach partners to provide 160+ middle school girls with computational thinking (CT) and coding skills within informal education spaces. Programs completed 3 curricular strands (Mobile Apps, Robotics, E-Textiles) between September 2017-May 2018. SciGirls Code integrates a computational participation framework with connected learning. The research study investigates the ways in which computational learning experiences impact girls' development of CT; interest and attitudes toward computer science; and their understanding of how participation in technology creation impacts themselves and the world around them. This study utilizes an interpretive multi-site case study design. There are multiple data sources with different data collected at focal and participating sites. The seven (7) focal cases represent an array of settings (rural, suburban, urban) as well as a variety of programming contexts (museums, community centers, after school). The remaining nine (9) sites comprise the participating cases. Notably, interviews (in-person) from focal sites and shorts (videos) from participating sites were collected at three moments in the programming (beginning, middle, end) to document changes in understandings and skills. Content analysis was conducted, and further triangulated in teams, to develop themes for each case and cross-case comparison. Thus far, the study has found that a connected learning approach boosted the development of middle school girls' CT skills, positively impacted attitudes towards computing pathways/careers, and increased understandings of computational participation.},

abstract = {As cyberthreats become more commonplace, the teaching of cybersecurity concepts at an introductory level is becoming increasingly important. However, teaching this subject in an engaging manner is challenging. This work investigates the use of a game-based learning approach to teaching cybersecurity concepts in the form of a card game called Program Wars. Within the game, players use cards to create a representation of a computer program while launching cyberattacks at their opponents and defending their own program. As the initial version of the game presented cybersecurity concepts at only a high-level, Program Wars&nbsp;v.2.0&nbsp;was created to introduce players to eight common cyberattacks and the tools used to defend against them. The results of a user study show that after playing Program Wars&nbsp;v.2.0&nbsp;a player’s knowledge of cybersecurity concepts is improved, showing that our game-based learning approach provides an effective means for introducing cybersecurity concepts to those with little or no prior knowledge. As Program Wars&nbsp;is a freely available web-based game, it can easily be integrated into classes to improve a student’s knowledge of cybersecurity concepts.},

Both conditions received the same practice problems. The only difference was that when requesting help, the control condition showed students a complete solution (CC condition), simulating the most traditional LLM output. Results indicated that students who received personalized Parsons puzzles as scaffolding engaged in practicing significantly longer than those who received complete solutions when struggling.},

In a CS1 class, a key to effective learning lies in identifying students' productive and less-productive coding habits. One way to gain such insights is to review the steps students take while coding. Therefore, students need coding tools that collect and display data about their working process. This tutorial introduces CS1 teachers to Process Feedback, a free online compiler that makes the coding process transparent. It enables students to explore their working process so they can self-reflect and learn. By focusing on the process, students are motivated to excel not only in their final code but also in how they approach coding. Analyzing process data also helps students develop critical thinking and metacognitive skills. The compiler also translates compiler-generated error messages to plain English explanations, enabling students to use AI in a safeguarded manner. During the tutorial, participants will learn how they can integrate the Process Feedback compiler into their courses and how their students can use it. The online compiler is available at www.processfeedback.org, and students do not need to create an account to use it. Participants are expected to bring their laptops to the tutorial.},

abstract = {Data-driven decision making is fast becoming a necessary skill in jobs across the board. The industry today uses analytics and machine learning to get useful insights from a wealth of digital information in order to make decisions. With data science becoming an important skill needed in varying degrees of complexity by the workforce of the near future, we felt the need to expose school-goers to its power through a hands-on exercise. We organized a half-day long data science tutorial for kids in grades 5 through 9 (10-15 years old). Our aim was to expose them to the full cycle of a typical supervised learning approach - data collection, data entry, data visualization, feature engineering, model building, model testing and data permissions. We discuss herein the design choices made while developing the dataset, the method and the pedagogy for the tutorial. These choices aimed to maximize student engagement while ensuring minimal pre-requisite knowledge. This was a challenging task given that we limited the pre-requisites for the kids to the knowledge of counting, addition, percentages, comparisons and a basic exposure to operating computers. By designing an exercise with the stated principles, we were able to provide to kids an exciting, hands-on introduction to data science, as confirmed by their experiences. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the tutorial was the first of its kind. Considering the positive reception of such a tutorial, we hope that educators across the world are encouraged to introduce data science in their respective curricula for high-schoolers and are able to use the principles laid out in this work to build full-fledged courses.},

Our learning environment leverages VR technology and principles of embodied cognition that prioritize "hands in" learning. Instead of creating algorithms through traditional computational programming (which often renders the structure and components of an algorithm opaque), students using our technology build "concrete algorithms" in the form of a virtual Rube Goldberg-type machine that makes the algorithm's structure, components, and functioning visible.},

To address this need, a broad spectrum of animation programming environments and games have been created to engage learners. However, most of these tools are designed for the touchpad/mouse and keyboard, and few have been evaluated to assess their efficacy in developing CT/programming skills. This is problematic when trying to understand the validity of such designs for CS education, and whether there are alternative approaches that may prove more effective. My dissertation work helps address this problem. After creating a framework based on a meta-review that carefully dissects embodiment strategies in learning games, I am building and evaluating tangible and augmented reality versions of a CT game.

abstract = {Educational researchers have increasingly drawn attention to how students develop computational thinking (CT) skills, including in science, math, and literacy contexts. A key component of CT is the process of abstraction, a particularly challenging concept for novice programmers, but one vital to problem solving. We propose a framework based on situated cognition that can be used to document how instructors and students communicate about abstractions during the problem solving process. We develop this framework in a multimodal interaction analysis of a 32-minute long excerpt of a middle school student working in the PixelBots JavaScript programming environment at a two-week summer programming workshop taught by undergraduate CS majors. Through a microgenetic analysis of the process of teaching and learning about abstraction in this excerpt, we document the extemporaneous prioritization of subgoals and the back-and-forth coordination of problem solving phases. In our case study, we identify that (a) problem solving phases are nested with several instances of context-switching within a single phase; (b) the introduction of new ideas and information creates bridges or opportunities to move between different problem solving phases; (c) planning to solve a problem is a non-linear process; and (d) pedagogical moves such as modeling and prompting highlight situated resources and advance problem solving. Future research should address how to help students structure subgoals and reflect on connections between problem solving phases, and how to help instructors reflect on their routes to supporting students in the problem solving process.},

abstract = {Robotics in education has special relevance in current digital society where students should know how to deal with technology. In this paper, it is presented an educational experiment in the mobile robotics domain. The referred experiment was part of a summer camp, which took place at the Polytechnic Institute of Bragan\c{c}a Portugal, being its technological aspects related with mobile robotics. Other than the technological aspects, the students participated in many different cultural and social activities, having the opportunity to know the city of Bragan\c{c}a and also to know different persons, mainly students, professors, researchers and laboratory technicians. The applied approach in the summer camp was a challenge based learning methodology, being involved in the experiment 3 professors, 4 monitors, working with a group of 16 secondary school students. The described experiment was planned as an activity of the RoboSTEAM - Integrating STEAM and Computational Thinking development by using robotics and physical devices ERASMUS+ Project.},

abstract = {Over the past ten years, global efforts have promoted computational thinking in K-12 computer science education. With the increasing prevalence of machine learning and artificial intelligence, there is a pressing need to broaden the scope of computational thinking to enable students to become competent, creative, and critical learners. Future digital literacies should encompass an appreciation of the distinctions between machine and human thinking, an awareness of the social aspects of data production, and an understanding of the values, biases, and historical contexts embedded within digital technologies. This opens up new possibilities for teachers and schools to guide students in actively shaping their digital destinies.},

Computer science courses and academic pathways are not always offered in secondary schools. Many teachers are not trained in computer science, yet are pushed to incorporate more computing, computational thinking, and computer usage. A qualitative focus group study was implemented to assess the computer science identities of African American teachers and of their respective urban secondary schools serving African American students. Three major codes were identified: district administration of computer and computing implementation, teacher attitudes towards computer science instruction, and teachers' recommendations to improve computer science and computational thinking instruction and outreach for African American secondary school students. Findings can be used to improve computer science and technology rollout programs from county and district administrations, teacher instruction with digital tools, and computer science outreach for African American secondary school students.},

abstract = {ccheck, a lenient automatic grader and C style-checker, to guide students to improve their coding practices. Many computing classes rely heavily on autograders--software that automates grading and alleviates staff workload in classes with large enrollments. At best, autograders offer timely and consistent feedback to students. However, existing autograders primarily judge on functional correctness---they are generally strict and inflexible in marking beginner programming assignments. They tend not to provide feedback on programming style and structure, which instead requires delayed, tedious manual assessment. ccheck, the tool we introduce, aims to address this gap and provide more meaningful, real-time feedback with a pedagogical focus.We deploy ccheck in a class of 440 first-year computer science students. Teaching assistants employ the system for marking assistance, while students use the same system for self-evaluation prior to finalizing their submissions. Feedback was solicited through a survey of 76 students and a focus group of the teaching team. 82% of the students surveyed said that the system helped them learn good coding practices, while 75% emphasized that the feedback received from the system is meaningful and helpful. The teaching team focus group related to how they valued the automation of menial marking tasks, which enabled them to direct their time toward other meaningful feedback. Overall, we find that teaching, learning and student experiences are improved through the deployment of ccheck.},

abstract = {Being able to find and fix errors is an essential skill in computer programming. Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Overall, there is a lack of respective concepts and materials for the classroom as well as research on how to teach debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom must take learners’ preexisting experience into account to be effective. In their daily lives, students are confronted with errors long before they build programming experience: Whether there is a problem with “the internet” or with their bicycle, they are troubleshooting and locating and fixing errors. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate students’ preexisting debugging traits. To this end, we developed a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting exercises. This allows us to observe students’ troubleshooting behavior in a natural environment. Building upon this, we employed the escape room approach with around 150 high school students and analyzed the resulting video data. Based on the data we identify preexisting debugging traits such as students struggling to generate hypotheses or to undo changes. Furthermore, they are not able to effectively test a system and struggle with cognitive load in topographic search. Therefore, our study firstly contributes to understanding and explaining the behavior of novice debuggers. The second contribution is an innovative methodology to analyze preexisting debugging traits.},

We are proposing a project to enhance teachers competencies around DT concepts (skills, processes and dispositions). The project plans to develop targeted activities for teachers to deliver DT. These activities will incorporate real-world applications of DT, computational thinking, problem-solving, and creative skills all delivered through play-based pedagogies. To ensure that no teacher or school will be negatively impacted due to technological requirements, AWS In Communities are going to send every Primary School in Ireland a Digital Technology kit comprising of a plugged device and an unplugged computational thinking game.},

abstract = {Computational thinking is an approach to problem solving that is typically employed by computer programmers. The advantage of this approach is that solutions can be generated through algorithms that can be implemented as computer code. Although computational thinking has historically been a skill that is exclusively taught within computer science, there has been a more recent movement to introduce these skills within other disciplines. Psychology is an excellent example of a discipline that would benefit from computational thinking skills because of the nature of questions that are typically asked within the discipline. However, there has not been a formal curriculum proposed to teach computational thinking within psychology and the behavioural sciences. I will argue that computational thinking is a fundamental skill that can easily be introduced to psychology students throughout their undergraduate education. This would provide students with the skills necessary to become successful researchers, and would also provide a practical and marketable skill to all psychology graduates.}

abstract = {As schools and districts across the United States adopt computer science standards and curriculum for K-12 computer science education, they look to integrate the foundational concepts of computational thinking (CT) into existing core subjects of elementary-age students. Research has shown the effectiveness of teaching CT elements (abstraction, generalization, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, debugging) using non-programming, unplugged approaches. These approaches address common barriers teachers face with lack of knowledge, familiarity, or technology tools. Picture books and graphic novels present an unexplored non-programming, unplugged resource for teachers to integrate computational thinking into their CT or CT-integrated lessons. This analysis examines 27 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2020 targeted to K-6 students for representation of computational thinking elements. Using the computational thinking curriculum framework for K-6, we identify the grade-level competencies of the CT elements featured in the books compared to the books’ target age groups. We compare grade-level competencies to interest level to identify each CT element representation as “foundational,” “on-target,” or “advanced.” We conclude that literature offers teachers a non-programming unplugged resource to expose students to CT and enhance CT and CT-integrated lessons, while also personalizing learning based on CT readiness and interest level.}

Subaims of the study are to identify the conceptual structure of PSWD based on definitions in academic publications and to classify the reasons given in the literature to show the need for PSWD. For the purposes to investigate PSWD conceptually, to classify the reasons given for the need for PSWD, the obtained 54 publications were analyzed via content analysis. Moreover, this study investigates the most frequently suggested or used teaching strategies (in terms of instructional methods, instructional tools, and grade level) for PSWD in the literature. The frequencies of used words in selected publications referring instructional methods, instructional tools, and grade levels were shown in the findings of study. The importance of the study stems from its focus on a new approach to computational thinking instructional implementation.}

This access, however, is not always extended to students with disabilities. One way to increase CT and CS (CT/CS) exposure for students with disabilities is through preparing special education teachers to do so. In this study, researchers explore exposing special education preservice teachers to the ideas of CT/CS in the context of a mathematics methods course for students with disabilities or those at risk of disability. Through analyzing lesson plans and reflections from 31 preservice special education teachers, the researchers learned that overall emerging promise exists with regard to the limited exposure of preservice special education teachers to CT/CS in mathematics. Specifically, preservice teachers demonstrated the ability to include CT/CS in math lesson plans and showed understanding of how CT/CS might enhance instruction with students with disabilities via reflections on these lessons. The researchers, however, also found a need for increased experiences and opportunities for preservice special education teachers with CT/CS to more positively impact access for students with disabilities.}

Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as an important method in the United States for helping children learn to solve complex problems and develop skills necessary for coding and other computer science-related endeavors. Research has revealed that CT can be encouraged with children as young as 3–4 years of age. While some preschools and schools are incorporating CT into their curriculum for young children, ages 0–8 years, it is important to understand how environments outside of schools are using CT with young children, particularly given that, in the United States, a large percent of young children, ages 0–5 years, are not in formal school settings. This study provides insight into this area through 20 interviews with educators in libraries and museums to understand how they incorporate CT into their work with young children, ages 0–8 years, and their families. The interviews reveal that library and museum educators are using a variety of developmentally-appropriate approaches, such as play, experimentation, and narrative, to design and offer a diverse array of engaging, hands-on CT activities that allow young children to practice CT in child-centered, meaningful ways.}

Much attention has been paid to integrating CT into the traditional subject classrooms. This paper describes a scoping review of learning tools for integrating CT and mathematics in current empirical studies published from 2015 to 2021. The review showed that most of the studies implemented CT-intensive Math-connected integration. Five major types of CT tools had been identified, i.e., digital tangibles, apps and games, programming languages, formative or summative assessments, and other technological tools. In many instances, the tools also provide functions of assessment of CT skills. The most assessed CT competencies were including algorithms and algorithmic thinking, abstraction, testing and debugging, loops, and sequences. Geometry and Measurement was the most assessed mathematics topic. Our scoping review is beneficial in the investigation of the literature on CT and mathematics education, as well as guides those who are interested in developing curriculum, programs, or assessments that involve the integration of CT and mathematics.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has gained considerable attention and in-depth discussion over the last two decades. Although the significance of CT has been highlighted, it could be challenging for educators to teach CT. Fortunately, adopting robots in education has been evidenced to be of benefit to promoting students’ learning motivation, CT, and higher-order thinking skills. However, several significant factors affecting students’ programming performances in robot-assisted learning activities have been identified, such as cognitive needs and organization. In this study, a CMR-BBP (concept map robot block-based programming) approach was designed by integrating concept maps into robot block-based programming to enhance students’ programming learning. Moreover, a three-group experiment was carried out in an elementary school to evaluate their learning outcomes. The experimental results revealed that the CMR-BBP approach benefited the students’ perceptions of their computational thinking and problem solving in comparison with the R-BBP (robot block-based programming) and C-BBP (conventional block-based programming) approaches. Furthermore, regarding cognitive load, both the CMR-BBP and R-BBP approaches enhanced the students’ germane cognitive load, while the CMR-BBP approach effectively reduced their extrinsic cognitive load. This study could be a notable reference for designing other courses in conjunction with programming learning activities.}

abstract = {Computational thinking is believed to be beneficial for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning as it is closely related to many other skills required by STEM disciplines. There has been an increasing interest in integrating computational thinking into STEM and many studies have been conducted to examine the effects of this intervention. This meta-analysis examined the effects of computational thinking integration in STEM on students’ STEM learning performance in the K-12 education context. Following systematic procedures, we identified 20 publications with 21 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria from a range of academic databases. We extracted effect sizes on student learning outcomes in one-group pretest-posttest designs. We also examined a range of moderating variables in the models, including student levels, STEM disciplines, intervention durations, alignment with content standards (e.g., CSTA/NGSS), types of intervention (e.g., simulation), and the use of unplugged/plugged activities. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (g = 0. 85 [95% CI of 0.57–1.14]; p < .001), indicating a large overall effect of computational thinking integration on STEM learning outcomes. The effect sizes were significantly moderated by intervention durations. We provide a discussion of the findings and present implications for future research and practice.}

Twelve third graders (six males and six females) voluntarily participated in an experiment-based computer class conducted at a public elementary school in Taiwan. This study adopted a case study methodology to investigate research questions in one specific case (8-week CT educational training). A one-group quasi-experimental pretest and posttest design with the support of qualitative observation was used to examine four research topics: CT competence progress, programming behaviors in a CT framework, factors influencing CT competence, and learning responses to CT training. The quantitative results indicated that students immersing in weekly programming projects significantly improved in terms of their CT competence, which was mostly retained 1 month after completion of the class. The programming behaviors indicated that students’ CT concepts (sequence, event, and parallelism) and practice (testing and debugging as well as reusing and remixing) significantly improved. Moreover, parents’ active involvement in take-home assignments influenced students’ long-term CT competence retention. The qualitative results indicated that students enjoyed using tablet computers to learn ScratchJr programming and demonstrated various leaning behaviors in a three-stage instructional design model.}

abstract = {Increased technological advances within marine biology requires professionals to become versed in interdisciplinary computer-based skills. Computational thinking (CT) is a contemporary concept used in educational settings across the globe to meet this need. CT has been incorporated into many curricula; however, incorporation strategies are vague and result in specific challenges for post-secondary marine science educators. We developed a framework to support an intervention which incorporated CT into learning marine biology quantitative skills for students in an introductory marine science course at a small liberal arts university in the northeastern United States through a quasi-experimental action research design. We assessed student participant content knowledge through two assessments, student artifacts and a self-perception survey. Results indicate that the intervention was successful in overall participant knowledge gains in both quantitative marine biology skills and computational thinking. Our research design may shed light on how post-secondary institutions may address student range of computational thinking skills within marine science to better support sustainability practices and promote equity and present its applicability to other settings.}

abstract = {The design of real-world industrial systems is subject to a natural tendency towards modularization in order to manage complexity. In addition, this article considers that patterns of self-similarity in many problem domains have made many such solutions naturally representable as holarchies. Likewise, the increasing need for autonomous local decision making as well as the demand to produce solutions at scale has increased the relevance of the multi-agent paradigm to the creation of modern software systems. A variety of software development patterns are explored for their compatibility with holonic multi-agency. The current skill sets required by software development workers and concomitant training activities focus on instilling computational thinking abilities, a set of related cognitive competencies useful in the development of such systems. Intelligent systems play an increasingly important role in modern development and often benefit from computational intelligence techniques for the purpose of parameter tuning. This position paper explores the intersections between holonic multi-agency, modern information systems development, the computational intelligence which train them and the computational thinking skills those developers should be trained in.}

The challenges were analysed according to a taxonomy focusing on the presence of computational thinking (CT) elements in mathematics contexts: preparing problems, programming, create computational abstractions, as well as troubleshooting and debugging. Our results suggested that the challenges experienced by students were compounded by both having to learn the CT-based environment as well as to apply mathematical concepts and problem solving in that environment. Possible explanations for the observed challenges stemming from differences between CT and mathematical thinking are discussed in detail, along with suggestions towards improving the effectiveness of integrating CT into mathematics learning. This study provides evidence-based directions towards enriching mathematics education with computation.}

abstract = {With the increasing importance of Computational Thinking (CT) at all levels of education, it is essential to have valid and reliable assessments. Currently, there is a lack of such assessments in upper primary school. That is why we present the development and validation of the competent CT test (cCTt), an unplugged CT test targeting 7–9 year-old students. In the first phase, 37 experts evaluated the validity of the cCTt through a survey and focus group. In the second phase, the test was administered to 1519 students. We employed Classical Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to assess the instruments’ psychometric properties. The expert evaluation indicates that the cCTt shows good face, construct, and content validity. Furthermore, the psychometric analysis of the student data demonstrates adequate reliability, difficulty, and discriminability for the target age groups. Finally, shortened variants of the test are established through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. To conclude, the proposed cCTt is a valid and reliable instrument, for use by researchers and educators alike, which expands the portfolio of validated CT assessments across compulsory education. Future assessments looking at capturing CT in a more exhaustive manner might consider combining the cCTt with other forms of assessments.}

abstract = {Most studies suggest that students develop computational thinking (CT) through learning programming. However, when the target of CT is decoupled from programming, emerging evidence challenges the assertion of CT transferability from programming. In this study, CT was operationalized in everyday problem-solving contexts in a learning experiment (n = 59) that investigated whether learning programming enhances students’ CT skills. Specifically, this study examined the influence of a novel, systematic and micro instructional strategy that is grounded in abstraction and comprised of four independent but related processes – discover, extract, create, and assemble (DECA) towards simplification of problem-solving. Subsidiary questions explored the effects of students’ age, gender, computer proficiency, and prior programming experience on the development of CT. No significant difference was found between the CT skill and programming knowledge of the groups at the posttest. However, within-group paired t-tests showed that the experimental group that integrated DECA had significant improvement in CT but not in the control group across the pretest-posttest axis. Implications of the inconclusive finding about the transfer of programming skills to CT are emphasized and the arguments for disentangling CT from programming are highlighted.}

Computational thinking has attracted much interest and debatably ranks in importance with the time-honoured literacy skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, learning interventions in this subject have modelled computational thinking differently. We conducted a systematic review of 81 empirical studies to examine the nature, explicitness, and patterns of definitions of computational thinking. Data analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies operationalised computational thinking as a composite of programming concepts and preferred definitions from assessment-based frameworks. On the other hand, a substantial number of the studies did not establish the meaning of computational thinking when theorising their interventions nor clearly distinguish between computational thinking and programming. Based on these findings, this article proposes a model of computational thinking that focuses on algorithmic solutions supported by programming concepts which advances the conceptual clarity between computational thinking and programming.}

abstract = {Although abstraction is widely understood to be one of the primary components of computational thinking, the roots of abstraction may be traced back to different fields. Hence, the meaning of abstraction in the context of computational thinking is often confounded, as researchers interpret abstraction through diverse lenses. To disentangle these conceptual threads and gain insight into the operationalisation of abstraction, a systematic review of 96 empirical studies was undertaken. Analysis revealed that identifying features of entities, extracting relevant features, discovering patterns, creating rules and assembling the parts together were the core actions of abstraction. With the primary aim of simplifying practical procedures, abstraction was operationalised as the sophistication of a program, the matching of patterns, the creation of alternative representations, the transfer of solutions, the measurement of a learner’s activity and reading program codes. There is an obvious need for researchers to align the conceptual meanings they have established of abstraction with the practical facts of operationalisation. The need to empirically validate emerging models and the implications for future research are discussed.}

In tradition instruction, PFCT (problem identification, flow definition, coding, and testing) is a commonly adopted procedure to guide students to learn and practice computer programming. However, without further guidance, students might focus on learning the syntax of computer programming language rather than the concept of solving problems. This study proposes a peer-assessment-supported PFCT (PA-PFCT) approach for boosting students’ computer programming knowledge and computational thinking awareness. A quasi-experiment was conducted on a computer programming course in a high school to evaluate its influence on students’ learning achievement, computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy. An experimental group of 51 students learned with the proposed approach, while a control group of 49 students learned with the traditional PFCT (T-PFCT) approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhanced the students’ computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy, while not having significant impacts on their computer programming knowledge test scores.}

Inspired by the computational thinking (CT) strategies and the 5E instructional model, we investigated students’ mathematical learning of fractions in a Scratch (block-based programming) environment. Students developed CT concepts, practices, and perspectives by building a “fraction magic calculator” in groups. This study analyzed the lesson design, students’ drawings, interviews, and work expressing their mathematical understanding of fractions in Scratch applications. The learning tasks were designed to support the students’ fraction learning and utilized computational abstractions in the form of variables, functions, and iterations to formulate mathematical models in a programming context. Students’ artifacts and feedback showed they were interested in learning fractions in a programming learning context, contributing to exercising and improving their fraction concepts and CT. Ultimately, we emphasized the benefits of CT integrated into mathematics education, promoting students’ understanding of fraction concepts, a set of CT abilities (concepts, practices, perspectives), and learning motivation. Moreover, we suggested a set of non-cognitive skills (e.g., socializing, expressing) to enrich the CT perspectives in the framework and show the importance of developing coding communities to co-create digital artifacts among learners. Overall, we highlighted that mathematics teachers should apply and create learning tasks that promote computational thinking to forge mathematical ideas and thinking.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant interest among many educators around the globe. Despite this growing interest, research on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of method to assess students’ CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary school students’ understanding of CT concepts, computational problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the 5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges of the 5E-based FCM are discussed.}

Nonetheless, these tools alone may not ensure the spontaneous and efficient acquisition of concepts and skills in computational thinking (CT). Using mind mapping as a form of scaffolding to facilitate the visualization of abstract thinking processes may enhance the effectiveness of programming instruction. This study therefore investigated the effects of mind mapping-based scaffolding that integrates five CT skills on elementary students’ CT development. Eighty-six fifth-grade students participated in our pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study. In the experimental group, mind mapping-based scaffolding was used to help students learn programming, while in the comparison group it was not used. The results showed that both groups achieved significant improvements in concept understanding and skill development; however, students instructed using mind mapping-based scaffolding obtained notably superior performance in understanding CT concepts and mastering CT skills. The results also revealed that the students had positive perceptions of mind mapping-based scaffolding, although challenges were also identified. This study enriches the relevant empirical research and offers insights for practitioners on designing effective scaffolding to promote students’ CT development.}

The proposed FACT pedagogy has been implemented using the concept of X-ray machine in biomedical instrumentation course and biomolecules, in biochemistry course. Using fishbone approach, various components of X-ray machine in biomedical course and the components of biomolecules in biochemistry course are visually explained as ribs and riblets of a fishbone diagram, without coining the keywords X-ray and biomolecules in an engineering institution and science institution respectively. Finally, the targeted concept is arrived and explained. Similarly, the same concepts of X-ray and biomolecules are coined among students and they are asked to divide or decompose the concepts into sub-concepts separately. To implement and evaluate the proposed pedagogy, an engineering institution and a science institution have been selected and evaluation results have been published in this article. In this pedagogical approach, the same complex concept is taught as a backward thinking by the teacher using fishbone pedagogy and forward thinking by the students using computational thinking pedagogy. This combined approach helps students to understand any complex concept in science courses. Also, it helps the teachers to easily convey and embed the same among the student community while teaching science courses.}

abstract = {Previous research has not adequately explored students’ behavioral processes when addressing computational thinking (CT) problems of varying difficulty, limiting insights into students’ detailed CT development characteristics. This study seeks to fill this gap by employing gamified CT items across multiple difficulty levels to calculate comprehensive behavioral sequence quality indicators. And then, through latent profile analysis, we identified four distinct latent classes of behavioral process. We then examined the in-game performance differences among these classes, uncovering each class’s unique attributes. Class 1 students consistently demonstrated high-quality, efficient behavioral sequences regardless of item difficulty. In contrast, class 2 students applied significant cognitive effort and trial-and-error strategies, achieving acceptable scores despite low behavioral sequence quality. Class 3 students excelled in simpler items but faltered with more complex ones. Class 4 students displayed low motivation for challenging items, often guessing answers quickly. Additionally, we investigated the predictive value of students’ performance in gamified items and their behavioral process classes for their external CT test scores. The study finally elaborated on the theoretical implications for researchers and the practical suggestions for teachers in CT cultivation.}

abstract = {This study explored (1) pedagogical strategies in Educational Coding and Robotics (ECR) learning which can develop computational thinking of students and (2) the degree of teacher centrality in the ECR classroom. In addition, we investigated (3) the added value of the Small Private Online Course (SPOC) to teacher professional development (TPD). We analyzed reflections of 80 in-service teachers on TPD through the SPOC (1,091 statements) and conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 of them one year after completing the course and teaching ECR in the classroom (328 statements). The most prominent strategies immediately after the TPD were constructing learning experiences, tinkering & debugging, and interdisciplinary learning, while one year later, experiential learning and collaborative learning were more common. Regarding the degree of teacher centrality, a year after teaching ECR curriculum the teachers had a significantly higher percentage of statements reflecting their role as a guide-on-the-side and as a partner of students in the learning process. Regarding the contribution of the SPOC for TPD, teacher statements revealed significantly more benefits than challenges in both points of time. Interestingly, the same categories emerged bottom-up as benefits and challenges: a variety of control dimensions, independent learning, learning and knowledge management and collaboration. Implications for educational theory and ECR practice are discussed.}

abstract = {Background In today’s world, acquiring essential skills is crucial for empowering individuals, particularly children, to handle everyday challenges and tasks in a technologically advanced society. Among these skills, computational thinking (CT) plays a vital role in problem-solving and adapting to the complex and evolving demands of the 21st century. However, it is necessary to explore the role of other thinking skills alongside CT, considering that CT cannot be improved and applied in isolation. Objective This paper aims to address the gap in knowledge regarding the application of systems thinking to CT development and its integration into education settings. Methods Results from two studies, focusing on CT development using educational robotics and maker technologies, form the basis of this paper. The research findings are synthesized and consolidated using the systemic FMA (framework of ideas, methodology, and area of concern) model. Results The research findings illustrate that utilizing a diverse set of approaches, methods, and tools can improve CT skill development across different educational settings. Conclusions The adapted FMA model promotes methodological pluralism and facilitates a critical examination of CT development boundaries, leading to both conceptual and practical changes. This approach enables the recognition of emergent properties, the design of interventions, and the incorporation of multiple perspectives.}

abstract = {Educational games have been increasingly used to improve students’ computational thinking. However, most existing games have focused on the theoretical knowledge of computational thinking, ignoring the development of computational thinking skills. Moreover, there is a lack of integration of adaptivity into educational computer games for computational thinking, which is crucial to addressing individual needs in developing computational thinking skills. In this study, we present an adaptive educational computer game, called AutoThinking, for developing students’ computational thinking skills in addition to their conceptual knowledge. To evaluate the effects of the game, we conducted an experimental study with 79 elementary school students in Estonia, where the experimental group learned with AutoThinking, while the control group used a traditional technology-enhanced learning approach. Our findings show that learning with the adaptive educational computer game significantly improved students’ computational thinking related to both conceptual knowledge and skills. Moreover, students using the adaptive educational computer game showed a significantly higher level of interest, satisfaction, flow state, and technology acceptance in learning computational thinking. Implications of the findings are also discussed.}

abstract = {The capability of computer programming language logic is one of the basics of technical education. How to improve students “interest in program logic design and help overcome students” fears of coding has become vital for educators. Cultivating practical talents with information technology application and basic programming development will become one of the important topics in the department of information related science. The objective of this research is to improve the ability of learning basic programming courses by using Zuvio interactive software. Zuvio employs the mathematical logic of computational thinking to analyze problems and enhance learners’ interest in learning programming skills through a graphical interface tool with building blocks. It uses innovative interactive teaching to use peer and self-assessment to study the content of the course. Zuvio improves the design ability of different groups of class learning Python programming. In line with the innovative teaching policy of the schools and the current stage of the learner’s learning model, learning effectiveness can be achieved. The research results were analyzed by midterm and final experimental group scores, and the progress of the experimental group’s scores was examined through descriptive statistics. The average and standard deviation of the assessment were used to analyze the progress of the experimental group students in the programming course. In the classroom, assessment criteria were set up as the basis for peer assessment scoring. After the midterm and final exams, the teacher assessment and peer assessment scores were analyzed for cognitive differences, and possible learning differences were analyzed. The students’ professional ability was examined to see if it met the professional standards required by the course, and whether innovative teaching methods could improve the learning outcomes of learners with different professional backgrounds in Python programming.}

abstract = {This study proposed plugged and unplugged approaches for young students to simultaneously improve their interdisciplinary learning performance in English and Computational Thinking (CT). The plugged approach involved adopting educational robots to enhance CT and to provide English vocabulary and sentence practice via a board game. The unplugged version of the educational board game involved using a conventional board game without a computer, although it was designed for practicing CT as well as some foreign language vocabulary and conversational sentences. The results show that both approaches were helpful for simultaneously improving the students’ English proficiency of the target vocabulary and sentences, and their CT competence. The students’ foreign language learning anxiety during the English conversation in the plugged game was significantly lower than that of the students playing the unplugged game. On one hand, the cooperation tendency of the CT scale improved significantly for the students playing the unplugged game. On the other hand, the critical thinking of the CT scale improved significantly for those using the plugged approach. This research provides an innovation development and evaluation for plugged and unplugged approaches.}

abstract = {This study employs meta-analysis to synthesize findings from 30 articles investigating gender differences in computational thinking (CT) among K-12 students. Encompassing 51 independent effect sizes, the meta-analysis involves a participant pool of 9181 individuals from various countries, comprising 4254 males and 4927 females. Results indicate statistically significant gender differences in CT (Hedges’s g = 0.091, p < .05), albeit with a modest effect size, revealing higher CT scores among males compared to females. Further moderation analyses unveil the multifaceted nature of these gender differences. Specifically, while gender differences become significant during high school, recent studies suggest a gradual reduction in CT gender differences with societal progress among K-12 students. Moreover, findings illustrate variations in gender differences across geographical regions. Notably, while the overall gender disparity in CT is non-significant in the “East Asia and Pacific” region, it widens in “North America” and “Europe”, with males scoring higher than females. Conversely, in “Europe and Central Asia”, such gender differences present inconsistent outcomes, with females scoring higher than males. Importantly, assessment tool type does not significantly influence gender differences. Lastly, this study offers recommendations to address CT gender gaps, providing valuable insights for promoting gender equality in education.}

abstract = {Persistence has proven to be a great challenge in online learning environments. Gaming and interactivity have been suggested as essential features in reducing dropout and increasing persistence in online learning. Yet in interactive game-based learning environments, persistence in moving forward in the game may come at the expense of investing in each of the game’s levels. That is, the motivation to complete the game may have a deleterious effect on learning at specific levels and hence on learning from the game in general. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on microlevel persistence (i.e., persistence during each component of the learning process). We study microlevel persistence in the context of acquiring computational thinking—the thought process of solving problems through abstraction—which is a key component of the new literacies needed for tomorrow’s citizens. In this study, we analyze data collected from an online, game-based learning environment (CodeMonkeyTM). The data document the activity of first to sixth graders (N = 2,040). Overall, we find that persistence is positively associated with difficulty and that the most determined learners were highly persistent across topics in achieving the best solution.}

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) and creativity are considered two vital skills for the 21st century that should be incorporated into future curricula around the world. We studied the relationship between these two constructs while focusing on learners’ personal characteristics. Two types of creativity were examined: creative thinking and computational creativity. The research was conducted among 174 middle school students from Spain. Data collected using a standardized creativity test (Torrance’s TTCT) were triangulated with data drawn from students’ log files that documented their activity in a game-based learning environment for CT (Kodetu). We found some interesting associations between CT and the two constructs of creativity. These associations shed light on positive associations between each of the two creativity constructs and CT acquisition, as well as between the two creativity constructs themselves. Additionally, we highlight differences between boys and girls, as girls were found to be more creative on both creativity measures. Other differences associated with school affiliation, prior coding knowledge, and technology affinity are also discussed.}

However, the associations between them are still not fully understood despite their recognition as essential competencies for the digital age. This study looks to bridge this gap by examining the association between CT and two types of creativity, i.e., Creative Thinking and Computational Creativity. The research was conducted among 124 middle school students from Spain, who were divided into control and experimental groups; the intervention included an explicit encouragement to be as creative as possible (i.e., to submit multiple correct solutions) in a given learning task. Data were analyzed from a standardized creativity test (Torrance’s TTCT) and cross-referenced with log files that documented the students’ activities in the Kodetu game-based learning environment. Our research findings indicate some interesting associations between CT and Creativity. First, we found that creativity contributes to CT. Second, we found that CT is transferable across different domains. Finally, we found that Computational Creativity can develop and improve over time.}

To measure the effectiveness of PPS, the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking and a self-assessment survey pre- and post-test were used. Findings indicated that PPS not only improved students’ overall logical thinking as much as did Logo programming learning, but also increased scores on one more subscale of logical thinking than did the Logo course. In addition, PPS significantly helped students understand the concept of computational thinking and increased their interest in learning computer science.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is being recognized as a critical component of student success in the digital era. Many contend that integrating CT into core curricula is the surest method for providing all students with access to CT. However, the CT community lacks an agreed-upon conceptualization of CT that would facilitate this integration, and little effort has been made to critically analyze and synthesize research on CT/content integration (CTCI). Conflicting CT conceptualizations and little understanding of evidence-based strategies for CTCI could result in significant barriers to increasing students’ access to CT. To address these concerns, we analyzed 80 studies on CT education, focusing on both the CT conceptualizations guiding current CT education research and evidence-based strategies for CTCI. Our review highlights the code-centric nature of CT education and reveals significant gaps in our understanding of CTCI and CT professional development for teachers. Based on these findings, we propose an approach to operationalizing CT that promotes students’ participation in CT, present promising methods for infusing content with CT, and discuss future directions for CT education research.}

abstract = {In this research, a scale was developed to determine the programming-oriented computational thinking skills of university students. The participants were 360 students studying in various departments at different universities in Turkey for computer programming. The scale consists of 33 items under conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation subscale. While there was no significant difference between the students’ conceptual knowledge and algorithmic thinking skills, the evaluation skills of male students differed significantly compared to females. Programming experience has a significant effect on conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation. The algorithmic thinking skills of the students who have low, middle, and high-level programming experience differed significantly. In terms of the development of conceptual knowledge and evaluation skills, it was observed that students should have at least one year of programming experience, but this experience will not make a significant difference if it is four years or more. It is thought that this scale, which is structured for different applications (e.g., web, game, robot) and learning environments (e.g., text, block) within the framework of its programming capabilities (conceptual, semantic, strategic knowledge), will contribute significantly to the evaluation of computational thinking as programming oriented.}

By explicitly connecting embodied actions with programming tasks, the intervention aimed to enhance students’ comprehension and transfer of CT skills. Forty-four first- and second-grade students participated in the study. The results showed significant improvements in students’ CT competency and positive attitudes toward CT.

abstract = {There are increasing calls to introduce computational thinking in schools; the arguments in favor call upon research suggesting that even kindergarten children can successfully engage in coding. This contribution presents a cross-sectional study examining the coding practices and computational thinking of fifty-one primary school children using the ScratchJr software; children were organized in two cohorts (Cohort 1: 6–9 years old; Cohort 2: 10–12 years old). Each cohort participated in a six-hour intervention, as part of a four-day summer club. During the intervention children were introduced to ScratchJr and were asked to collaboratively design a digital story about environmental waste management actions, thus adopting a disciplinary perspective to computational thinking. Data analyses examined children’s final artifacts, in terms of coding practices and the level of computational thinking demonstrated by each cohort. Furthermore, analysis of selected groups’ storyboard interviews was used to shed light on differences between the two cohorts. Results are presented and contrasted across the two age cohorts via a developmental perspective. The findings of this study can be useful in considering the instructional support that is necessary to scaffold the development of primary school children’s coding practices and computational thinking.}

abstract = {This study describes the development and validation process of a computational thinking (CT) test for adults. The team designed a set of items and explored a subset of those through two qualitative pilots. Then, in order to provide validity evidence based on the test content, a team of 11 subject-matter experts coded the initial pool of items using two different systems of categories based on CT components and contents. Next, the items were piloted on a sample of 289 participants, 137 experts in CT, and 152 novices. After a series of confirmatory factor analyses, a unidimensional model that represents algorithmic thinking was adopted. Further analyzing the psychometric quality of the 27 items, 20 of them with excellent reliability indices were selected for the test. Thus, this study provides a tool to evaluate adults’ CT: the Algorithmic Thinking Test for Adults (ATTA), which was developed according to psychometric standards. This article also reflects on the nature of CT as a construct.}

abstract = {As a dynamic and multifaceted construct, computational thinking (CT) has proven to be challenging to conceptualize and assess, which impedes the development of a workable ontology framework. To address this issue, the current article describes a novel approach towards understanding the ontological aspects of CT by using text mining and graph-theoretic techniques to elucidate teachers’ perspectives collected in an online survey (N = 105). In particular, a hierarchical cluster analysis, a knowledge representation method, was applied to identify sub-groups in CT conceptualization and assessment amongst teachers. Five clusters in conceptualization and two clusters in assessment were identified; several relevant and distinct themes were also extracted. The results suggested that teachers attributed CT as a competence domain, relevant in the problem- solving context, as well as applicable and transferrable to various disciplines. The results also shed light on the importance of using multiple approaches to assess the diversity of CT. Overall, the findings collectively contributed to a comprehensive and multi-perspective representation of CT that refine both theory and practice. The methodology employed in this article has suggested a minor but significant step towards addressing the quintessential questions of “what is CT?” and “how is it evidenced?”.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is an emerging and multifaceted competence important to the computing era. However, despite the growing consensus that CT is a competence domain, its theoretical and empirical account remain scarce in the current literature. To address this issue, rigorous psychometric evaluation procedures were adopted to investigate the structure of CT competency, as measured by Computational Thinking Challenge (Lai, 2021a), in a large sample of 1,130 British secondary school students (Mage = 14.14 years, SDage = 1.45). Based on model comparison from an exploratory multidimensional item response theory approach, the results supported the multidimensional operationalization of CT competency. A confirmatory bi-factor item response theory model further suggested CT competency is comprised of a general CT competency factor and two specific factors for programming and non-programming problem-solving. Despite the multidimensionality, the common variance is largely explained by a primary general factor of CT competency, thus the use of a single scale score is recommended. Psychometric evaluation from the bi-factor model indicated good psychometric properties of the assessment tool. Overall, the bi-factor model provides a useful approach to investigating CT competency and serves as a robust test validation tool.}

abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is essential for developing future-ready learners in both secondary and higher education levels. However, as students transition to higher education, many encounter challenges with independent learning and research. This can negatively impact their Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS), engagement, and practical expertise. This study introduces a solution: Computational Thinking Scaffolding (CTS) in the Jupyter Notebook environment, designed to enhance STEM education at the tertiary level. CTS incorporates five phases: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Algorithm Design, and Evaluation. Utilizing a quasi-experimental method, we assessed the impact of CTS on the HOTS, engagement, and practical skills of undergraduate and postgraduate students. Our findings hold substantial relevance for university educators, academic advisors, and curriculum designers aiming to enhance students’ HOTS and hands-on capabilities in STEM disciplines. The results validate the effectiveness of CTS in elevating tertiary STEM learning outcomes, and they spotlight the adaptability of the Jupyter Notebook as a valuable tool in higher education. In conclusion, our research underscores the merits of CTS for improving outcomes in higher STEM education and sets a benchmark for future endeavors in this domain.}

We examined culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy (CRTSE), culturally responsive teaching outcome expectancy (CRTOE) beliefs, and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) as teachers participated in one of three treatment groups: robotics only, game design only, or blended robotics/game design. Descriptive data revealed that CRTSE gain scores were higher in the robotics only and blended contexts than in the game design only context. However, CRTOE beliefs were consistent across all treatment groups. In regard to CT attitudes, teachers’ gain scores were higher in the game design only and blended contexts than in the robotics only context. In addition, there were differences by treatment group related to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) practices, while cultural artifacts were evident in each learning environment. The results of this study reveal some variability by treatment type and inform future research on equitable practices in engineering and computer science education.}

We introduce a CT competency assessment for middle school students. The assessment design process started by establishing a cognitive model of CT domain mastery, in which three broad skill types were identified to represent CT competency. After multiple-choice item prototypes were written, pilot tested, and revised, 15 of them were finally selected to be administered to 564 students in two middle schools in the Midwestern United States. Using a cognitive diagnostic scoring model, mastery classifications for each student were determined that can be used diagnostically by teachers as a pretest and, perhaps in the future, to compare the outcomes of CT instructional programs. The results inform an initial understanding of typical learning progressions in CT at the middle school level.}

The validity and reliability of the scale have been studied by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and calculating internal consistency coefficients. The sample of this study consisted of 631 in-service teachers from different Chinese primary schools (EFA N = 189; CFA N = 442). The 31-item scale mirrors five factors: cognitive knowledge of CT, practices and skills of CT, attitudes and perspectives of CT, CT teaching design, and CT teaching implementation. The discussion of the results looks at the future use of the CT scale in Chinese educational settings that mirror a specific national education policy, talent demand, and educational culture.}

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence have brought attention to computational thinking (CT) in school education worldwide. However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach’s alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide.}

abstract = {Addressing cognitive disparities has become a paramount concern in computational thinking (CT) education. The intricate and nuanced relationships between CT and cognitive variations emphasize the needs to accommodate diverse cognitive profiles when fostering CT skills, recognizing that these cognitive functions can manifest as either strengths or limitations in different students. Consequently, understanding the connections between students’ cognitive functions and CT skills assumes pivotal importance in the design of personalized instructional strategies for CT. Despite a general consideration of learning variability in CT education, empirical insights exploring the correlation between cognitive skills and CT competencies remain notably scarce. This study endeavors to bridge this research gap by investigating the links between executive functions and CT skills, as well as the associations between their sub-dimensions. The results reveal a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.452 between these two domains, underscoring the notable connection between executive functions and CT abilities. Furthermore, the sub-dimensional analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of how specific executive functions uniquely contribute to certain CT skills. In light of these findings, this research offers a promising pathway for the development of tailored CT education programs that can cater to the unique needs of each individual, ultimately facilitating inclusive CT programs and making significant contributions to broaden STEM education and future workforce.}

This study conducted a meta-analysis of 27 empirical studies to examine the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) for fostering students’ CT. The effects of various factors on the learning process for acquiring CT were also examined. The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students’ CT, and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges’ g = .600, 95% CI [.465, .735], p < .001). (b) Furthermore, conducting GBL can improve students’ CT concepts (Hedges’ g = .916, 95% CI [.410, 1.423], p < .001), CT skills (Hedges’ g = .494, 95% CI [.389, .600], p < .001), and CT perspectives (Hedges’ g = .927, 95% CI [.039, 1.816], p < .05). (c) Additionally, game mode, teaching context, and participant characteristics have positive effects on CT. Based on the findings, it is suggested that using more unplugged games and video games, designing collaborative game activities, and tailoring approaches according to gender difference and programming experience can effectively promote CT. The results have significance for fostering students’ CT in GBL; it is further suggested that instruction processes be rationally designed.}

While literature on computing education is vast, it remains unexplored how existing CT conceptualisations relate to the learning opportunities needed for a meaningful application of coding in non-Computer Scientists’ lives and careers. In order to identify and organise the learning opportunities in the literature about CT, we conducted a configurative literature review of studies published on Web of Science, between 2006 and 2021. Our sample gathers 34 papers and was analysed on NVivo to find key themes. We were able to organise framings of CT and related learning opportunities into three dimensions: functional, collaborative, and critical and creative. These dimensions make visible learning opportunities that range from individual cognitive development to interdisciplinary working with others, and to active participation in a technologically evolving society. By comparing and contrasting frameworks, we identify and explain different perspectives on skills. Furthermore, the three-dimensional model can guide pedagogical design and practice in coding courses.}

Data sources included pre–post content assessments of computational concepts related to programming in addition to computational artifacts and interviews with a purposeful sample of 12 participants. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods to identify gains in pre- and post-learning of computational thinking concepts and examine potential gender differences. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively. Results indicated that students made significant gains in their learning of computational thinking concepts and that gains persisted over time. Results also revealed differences in learning of computational thinking concepts among boys and girls both at the beginning and end of the program. Finally, results from student interviews provided insights into the development of computational thinking practices and perspectives over time. Results have implications for the design of after-school computing programs that help broaden participation in computing.}

Understanding how CT skills can be fostered in learning programming concepts through co-creating digital games is crucial to determine instructional strategies that match the young students’ interests and capacities. The empirical study has successfully produced a new checklist that can be used as a tool to describe the learning of CT skills when children co-create digital games. The checklist consists of 10 core CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, generalisation, representation, socialisation, code literacy, automation, coordination, and debugging. Thirty-six 10–12 year-olds from sub-urban primary schools in Borneo participated in creating games in three separate eight-hour sessions. In addition, one pilot session with five participants was conducted. The game co-creation process was recorded to identify and determine how these young, inexperienced, untrained young learners collaborated while using CT skills. Analysis of their narratives while co-creating digital games revealed a pattern of using CT while developing the games. Although none of the groups demonstrated the use of all ten CTs, conclusively, all ten components of the CT were visibly present in their co-created digital games.}

abstract = {This paper examines a method which can be used by instructors pursuing innovative methods for language teaching, which expands learners’ motivation in second language learning. Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving skill which can motivate students’ English language learning. Designing a learning activity which integrates CT into English language learning has been considered in only a few academic studies. This study aimed to explore whether integrating CT into English language learning can be useful for improving learners’ motivation and performance. The method of “present, practice, and produce” was applied as a method of presenting computational thinking in the English language learning classroom. Fifty-two elementary school students (52) participated in the experimental study. Following an experimental design, data were collected and analyzed from a combination of knowledge test scores, storytelling, motivation, and anxiety surveys. The experimental results indicate that the CT strategy improves students’ language learning and raises their motivation in the two dimensions of extrinsic and intrinsic goal orientation. These results imply the positive effect of CT strategy on strengthening problem-solving skills of students participating in digital storytelling and increases their motivation and performance in English language learning.}

abstract = {Educational technologists and practitioners have made substantial strides in developing affordable digital and tangible resources to support both formal and informal computer science instruction. However, there is a lack of research on practice-based assignments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) projects, that allow undergraduate students to design and demonstrate educational robots using digital or physical assistance, especially when it comes to computational thinking (CT) and programming skills development in association with their psycho-emotional experience. This study compares the impact of Scratch and LEGO® WeDo robotic kits on students’ CT and programming skills development. A quasi-experimental approach was conducted, involving two hundred forty-six participants (n = 246), who were equally divided between Scratch and LEGO® WeDo groups. Results indicate that the LEGO® WeDo group showed greater improvement in CT and programming skills development, while designing and presenting IoT projects. Nevertheless, no significant association between motivation, grit, and CT skills was observed. The findings highlight the potential of tangible robotics in facilitating students’ hands-on learning and enhancing motivation to foster CT and programming skills. This study provides a wide range of implications for instructional designers on how to use tangible robotics to support hands-on IoT projects in computer science courses.}

However, it remains unclear whether TPTs support these skills simultaneously. This study examines the impact of TPTs on enhancing cognitive thinking skills among students at different developmental stages, with a focus on early childhood education. A quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-tests was conducted involving 82 preschoolers aged 5-7. Participants were categorized into three developmental stages (beginner, intermediate, advanced) based on their prior programming experience. A TPT called “Bee-bot Brushing Challenge: A Computational Adventure” was employed during a STEM summer camp program. The findings revealed significant improvements in students’ abstract thinking, problem decomposition, and spatial reasoning skills, particularly among beginners. Participants at intermediate levels showed notable improvement in algorithm design and efficiency. Results also indicate significant differences in cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control between groups, with advanced students outperforming beginners and intermediates while working memory remained unaffected. This research provides important evidence supporting the inclusion of TPTs in early childhood curricula to foster comprehensive cognitive development. It offers valuable insights for educators and policymakers in designing similar learning environments.}

On the one hand, this brings us to analyze the relations and intersections between different process of thought (analytical, logical, mathematical, system, engineering, algorithmic) and the role of search for simplicity, generalization, and scalability in the layers of abstraction in Computational Thinking. On the other hand, we explore the roots and the discursive environment of authors that could contribute to this conceptualizing process in the years around its popularization following Jeannette Wing’s founding article in 2006. We have also included in our analysis the points of convergence with Seymour Papert’s work related to the computer-machine seen as an “object-to-think-with” helping to the construction of knowledge from an epistemological perspective to the computing-human. Even though a consensus on the definition of the concept has not yet ben encountered, the analysis helps to highlight the solid reference points that address what is at the core of Computational thinking and what should be the framework of educational interventions and research that revolve around it.}

abstract = {Background: Multilingual learners have been overlooked and understudied in computer science education research. As the CS for All movement grows, it is essential to design integrated, justice-oriented curricula that help young multilingual learners begin to develop computational thinking skills and discourses. Purpose: We present a conceptual framework and accompanying design principles for justice-centered computational thinking activities that are language-rich, with the aim of supporting learners’ agency and building their capacity over time to use computing for good in their communities. Setting: Our work takes place in a research–practice partnership centered in an elementary school in California with a significant multilingual Latinx population. Research Design: We have engaged in two cycles of design-based research with preservice and in-service teachers at an elementary school. Through analysis of one case study during the second and most recent cycle, we examined the potential of teachers using our design principles for supporting multilingual learners’ language development through engagement in computational thinking. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that multilingual learners will engage in productive discourse when computational thinking lessons are designed to (1) be meaningfully contextualized, (2) position students as agentic learners, and (3) promote coherence over time. However, more research is needed to understand how teachers use these principles over time, and what additional supports are needed to ensure coordination between stakeholders to develop and effectively implement coherent learning progressions.}

abstract = {Although socializing is a powerful driver of youth engagement online, platforms struggle to leverage social engagement to promote learning. We seek to understand this dynamic using a multi-stage analysis of over 14,000 comments on Scratch, an online platform designed to support learning about programming. First, we inductively develop the concept of “participatory debugging”—a practice in which users learn through the process of collaborative technical troubleshooting. Second, we use a content analysis to establish how common the practice is on Scratch. Third, we conduct a qualitative analysis of user activity over time and identify three factors that serve as social antecedents of participatory debugging: (1) sustained community, (2) identifiable problems, and (3) what we call “topic porousness” to describe conversations that are able to span multiple topics. We integrate these findings in a framework that highlights a productive tension between the desire to promote learning and the interest-driven sub-communities that drive user engagement in many new media environments.}

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) and the understanding of how programs are being executed is internationally acknowledging as a necessity for today’s students and citizens of tomorrow. Despite the multifaceted nature of CT, the introduction of CT and associate concepts such as coding is regarded as developmental acceptable for preschool and kindergarten children. For a decade, there has been a focus on educational reform in the form of educational apps. For young children, an influx of mobile apps offering various interfaces and styles promote themselves as having educational value to introduce children aged 5–7 to essential CT, coding, and problem-solving skills. On the contrary, little is known about the educational value of these apps. The fast pace at which developers produce these apps and the breadth of the available apps have gone beyond what it is reasonable for researchers and experts in the domain to evaluate. This article presents a literature review on how the ScratchJr app affects young children’s CT, coding, and general literacy skills. The literature review includes 18 studies. The main conclusion is that although ScratchJr is not a panacea, it seems to be a helpful app that positively affects children’s CT and coding skills.}

This study investigated factors that may lead to 4th and 5th grade elementary school students’ development of computational thinking skills in collaborative robotics activities by hypothesizing a model which proposed that a problem solving inventory, intrinsic motivation, and enjoyment were the main predictors of computational thinking skills. The model was then tested by surveying students with several psychometric inventories where a revised model was then constructed. The study found significant relationships between perceived competence and enjoyment, and learning motivation, and intrinsic motivation. Another important finding was that problem solving was a significant predictor of computational thinking skills. Results were interpreted with reference to implications for possible means of improving learning outcomes when using collaborative robotics in an educational setting.}

abstract = {Pair programming (PP) can help improve students’ computational thinking (CT), but the trajectory of CT skills and the differences between high-scoring and low-scoring students in PP are unknown and need further exploration. In this study, a total of 32 fifth graders worked on Scratch tasks in 16 pairs. The group discourse of three learning topics (comprising 9 projects) was collected. After the audio files were transcribed, 1,303 conversations were obtained. They were analyzed via Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) Webkit, which can reveal the trajectory of students’ CT development via analyzing codes of discourse related to CT in PP. Three Scratch learning topics were assessed based on the Dr. Scratch platform to acquire the level of students’ CT and to determine the low- and high-scoring groups. Results indicated that CT concepts and CT practices were always closely related in PP and CT practices, and CT perspectives could be gradually and closely related after a long period of CT training. A significant difference between the two groups’ CT structures was found. The high-scoring group had more fragments of CT practice and connecting of CT perspectives, while the low-scoring group showed more fragments of CT concepts and expressing of CT perspectives. This research provides insights into cultivating primary school students’ CT using Scratch in the context of PP. The findings can provide suggestions for instructors to design instructional interventions to facilitate students’ CT skills via PP learning. Instructors can improve CT skills by guiding students to constantly ask questions, and specifying the role swap between driver and navigator in PP. Besides, instructors could give more consideration to the development of CT perspectives, and especially the ability to question.}

This multi-level meta-analysis focused on debugging as a core CT skill, and investigated the effects of various debugging interventions. Moderator analyses revealed which interventions were effective, in which situations, and for what kind of learner. A significant overall mean effect of debugging interventions ( = 0.64, CI = (0.32, 0.96), p < .001), was found based on 62 effect sizes from 18 source articles. Significant between-studies variation indicated that true effects could range from −0.54 to 1.82. In addition, sensitivity analyses and checks on confounding provided further understandings of intervention features and their impacts. Interventions using enhanced debuggers and systematic instruction were particularly effective in fostering debugging skills. Debugging intervention effects varied by participant population and potentially by publication type. Moreover, debugging interventions had impact regardless of how debugging skills were measured, programming medium used, control-group type, and whether the study was randomized. Future studies should investigate the best practices for improving debugging abilities for whom and under what circumstances.}

This study employed a quasi-experimental design to address this gap, involving 64 secondary school students in two groups. For the beginning five weeks, the first group used an introductory block-based programming environment, while the second group used an introductory text-based programming environment. Then, both groups transitioned to professional text-based programming for the subsequent eight weeks. The results showed that participants who transitioned from introductory text-based programming to professional text-based programming (1) significantly outperformed in computational thinking skills; (2) had more code-writing and debugging behaviors and fewer irrelevant behaviors, and (3) had more interactions with the instructor. No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding enjoyment, confidence, and interest in programming. Drawing on these findings, this study proposes pedagogical implications that could facilitate the adoption of programming modalities within the broader context of STEM education.}

A total of 158 junior high school students and one teacher participated in the study over 5 months. The sample students were divided into four experimental groups in four single or combined programming approaches (i.e., plugged-in, unplugged, unplugged first, and plugged-in first) and one control group without programming. Data sources included the results of four CT tests, as well as interviews with the teacher and surveys with 24 representative participants. The results showed that the four programming approaches can effectively improve students’ CT skills and can be retained after two months. Among them, the form of implementing unplugged activities before plugged-in can most effectively improve CT skills, and can better weaken the impact of previous programming experience. Finally, the qualitative analysis results provided insights into the process of programming and CT education. These findings will provide implications for the introduction of CT in junior high school, and help expand students’ participation in computing.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), as a new future-oriented literacy, has gained attention at the basic education level. Graphical programming is the common way to develop CT in primary students, but this drag-and-drop programming may weaken students’ understanding of programming’s abstract concepts and code logic. Text-based programming approaches can solve the problems faced by graphical programming, but few studies have explored the impact of text-based programming on CT. Therefore, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 98 6th graders to explore the impact of gamified Python programming on CT. The findings showed that CT skills, as well as abstraction and decomposition, pattern recognition and evaluation in CT sub-skills, were significantly higher with students in the experimental group than in the control group. Furthermore, we found that gamified Python programming enabled boys and girls to reach the same level of CT skills. However, in terms of CT sub-skills, we found that gamified Python programming was more beneficial to the development of pattern recognition and evaluation skills for boys and abstraction and decomposition skills for girls. This demonstrated the effectiveness of gamified Python programming to improve primary students’ CT skills while clarifying the impact of gender and enriching research in the field of text-based programming.}

abstract = {The Computer Science Teachers Association has asserted that computational thinking equips students with essential critical thinking which allows them to conceptualize, analyze, and solve more complex problems. These skills are applicable to all content area as students learn to use strategies, ideas, and technological practices more effectively as digital natives. This research examined over 200 elementary students’ pre- and posttest changes in computational thinking from a 10-week coding program using adapted lessons from code.org’s Blockly programming language and CSUnplugged that were delivered as part of the regular school day. Participants benefited from early access to computer science (CS) lessons with increases in computational thinking and applying coding concepts to the real world. Interviews from participants included examples of CS connections to everyday life and interdisciplinary studies at school. Thus, the study highlights the importance of leveraging CS access in diverse elementary classrooms to promote young students’ computational thinking; motivation in CS topics; and the learning of essential soft-skills such as collaboration, persistence, abstraction, and creativity to succeed in today’s digital world.}

abstract = {This study aimed to develop the Computational Thinking Test for Elementary School Students (CTT-ES) to assess young children’s CT competencies in non-programming contexts and also examine the relationship between CT competencies and CT dispositions. A survey including a pool of CTT-ES candidate items and the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) was administered to 631 elementary school students. Rasch model of the Item Response Theory and the discrimination analysis of the Classical Testing Theory were conducted for item analyses. Pearson’s correlation analyses and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between CTT-ES and CTS scores. The results showed that the final CTT-ES including 16 items had a good fitness, discrimination, and reliability to evaluate elementary students’ domain-general CT competencies. The convergent validity of CTT-ES was confirmed by its significant correlations with the CTS scores. The significant regression model not only showed students’ CT competencies can be predicted by their CT dispositions but also supported The Developmental Model of CT. This study provided a valid and reliable tool for assessing young children’s CT abilities. It also furthered our understanding about the developmental orders of CT abilities and contributed to the theoretical construction of CT.}

abstract = {Computational thinking has received tremendous attention from computer science educators and educational researchers in the last decade. However, most prior literature defines computational thinking as thinking outcomes rather than thinking processes. Based on Selby and Woodland’s framework, this study developed and validated the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) to assess all students’ thought processes of computational thinking for both general and specific problem-solving contexts in five dimensions: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, evaluation and generalization. A survey including 25 candidate items for CTS as well as demographic variables was administered to 388 junior high school students in Taiwan. An explorative factor analysis using the principal axis method with the oblimin rotation was used to validate the scale. Finally, 19 items were extracted successfully under the designed five dimensions, with a total explained variance of 64.03% and an overall reliability of 0.91. Results of the demographic comparisons showed that boys had a greater disposition than girls in decomposition thinking when solving problems using computer programming. In addition, programming learning experience, especially self-directed learning and after-school learning, had significant positive effects on all dimensions of CTS. Several future studies are suggested using this tool.}

abstract = {A prior study developed the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) for assessing individuals’ computational thinking dispositions in five dimensions: decomposition, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, evaluation, and generalization. This study proposed the Developmental Model of Computational Thinking through validating the structural relationships among the five factors of the CTS. To examine the model, a questionnaire including the CTS was administered to 472 middle school students. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct of the measurements, and a PLS-SEM analysis was used to validate the structural relationships among the factors. The results confirmed that the 19-item CTS has good item reliability, internal consistency, and construct reliability for measuring computational thinking (CT). In the Developmental Model of CT, decomposition and abstraction significantly predict all other three CT dispositions, suggesting that they are the two fundamental factors required for CT development. Moreover, a significant linear prediction path was shown starting from algorithmic thinking, evaluation, until generalization. Thus, a multi-level model was confirmed for the conceptual framework of CT. This model suggests a possible sequence for CT development which may provide a guideline for the teaching objectives of CT for different learning stages in different school levels. Decomposition and abstraction are especially suggested to be emphasized in school curricula before teaching algorithmic thinking or algorithm designs.}

abstract = {The interest in Computational Thinking (CT) development among young learners increases with the number of studies located in literature. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to address two main objectives: (a) the effectiveness of empirical interventions on the development of CT in children aged of 3–8 years; and (b) the variables that influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Following PRISMA procedures, we identified 17 empirical studies with 34 effect sizes and 1665 participants meeting the inclusion criteria from Web of Science database. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (d = .83 [95% CI: 730, .890]; p < .001) on the CT development of 3–8 years old children, which provides empirical support for having young children to engage in CT experiences. The effect size was significantly influenced by moderating variables including gender, scaffolding, and education level. Intervention length showed a marginally significant effect. Therefore, educators could refer to the significant moderators when designing tailored interventions for CT development in early childhood education while a call for more empirical studies of CT development in young children is proposed.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered a fundamental skill that everyone in the 21st century should have. Game-based learning (GBL) may be used to teach CT, and it’s necessary to clarify how to design and implement game-based CT teaching. The literature was systematically searched for empirical studies published between 2011 and 2021. Thirty-nine studies were included in the review and findings suggested that GBL has positive effects on CT, but has non-significant effects on some CT elements (e.g., conditions, triggers, and abstraction) because of limited time to learn these elements and students’ preferences for using CT elements. Game elements, particularly clear goals and rules, progressive challenges, immediate feedback, storyline, avatar, social interaction and various reward mechanisms were used to motivate students to engage in activities to develop CT. Furthermore, single or multiple theoretical foundations, such as constructivist learning theory and experiential learning theory, may guide the design and implementation of game-based activities. Problem-solving, project-based approaches were used to encourage students to use CT to solve problems or complete a project. Finally, guidelines for designing and implementing game-based learning activities for promoting CT were discussed.}

Many researchers have designed instructional activities to achieve various learning goals within this field. Despite the prevalence of studies focusing on instructional design and student learning outcomes, how instructional efforts result in the integration of AI and CT in students’ learning processes remains unclear. To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies that have integrated AI and CT for student development. We collected 18 papers from four prominent research databases in the fields of education and AI technology: Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, and ACM. We coded the collected studies, highlighting the students’ learning processes in terms of research methodology and context, learning tools and instructional design, student learning outcomes, and the interaction between AI and CT. The integration of AI and CT occurs in two ways: the integration of disciplinary knowledge and leveraging AI tools to learn CT. Specifically, we discovered that AI- and CT-related tools, projects, and problems facilitated student-centered instructional designs, resulting in productive AI and CT learning outcomes.}

Many visual programming environments (VPEs) and physical robot courses have been integrated into computational thinking learning in the elementary education stage. This study explores the relationship between the programming learning environment (including VPE, physical robots, and no experience) and the computational thinking ability of higher-grade elementary school students of different genders. The results show that learning through VPE or physical robots can help students improve their computational thinking ability and that students learn better via physical robots. In addition, among the four dimensions of computational thinking ability, most students are weak in algorithm design. In terms of gender, no differences exist in computational thinking ability. Further analysis reveals that female students have better decomposition performance in VPE learning, while male students have better algorithm design performance.}

To uncover evidence for the connection between Computational Thinking and problem-solving skills, we conduct a systematic literature review of 37 papers collected from Web of Science database. The results indicate that (a) problem-solving is discussed in the 37 articles in the context of Computational Thinking, (b) the most frequently employed Computational Thinking stages in problem-solving skills are decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm, (c) Computational Thinking is closely linked to problem-solving, and (d) Computational Thinking and problem-solving stages serve the same functions in solving problems.

A quasi-experimental research method was adopted, wherein the experimental group was subjected to the situated learning strategy and the control group was subjected to a traditional teaching method. The study results revealed that integrating Webduino programming with situated learning could effectively improve five categories of CT skills; moreover, the activity models of situated learning enhanced the value and expectation dimensions of learning motivation. In addition, satisfaction with the course content and self-identity slightly improved. However, because teachers were required to elaborate on stories to promote learner engagement with life situations, the time available for programming was limited. Thus, no significant difference was observed in teaching satisfaction.}

A mixed-methods approach was employed in a study involving 60 participants; half were given CT instruction and half were instructed traditionally. Quantitative data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and path analysis, while MAXQDA software was employed for qualitative interview data. The study found a positive correlation between CT instruction and academic self-efficacy with increased academic resilience, particularly in the experimental group, and identified key factors contributing to resilience. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of computational thinking (CT) and academic self-efficacy in enhancing academic performance, offering a new understanding of how these elements can be integrated into education to boost student resilience. It establishes a direct empirical link between CT instruction and increased academic self-efficacy, underscoring the value of specific teaching methodologies in fostering resilience. The findings are significant for educators, policymakers, and stakeholders in developing strategies to enhance students’ academic and personal success, thereby promoting their overall well-being. Recognizing the importance of CT and self-efficacy paves the way for customized educational programs that effectively support and empower students to thrive.}

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is essential for developing creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence in the 21st century. Coding tools like robotic toys and tablet apps have become popular in early childhood education to support CT development, but there is a debate on which tool is more effective. Little evidence exists on the effect of coding on children’s Social-Emotional Competence (SEC), which is crucial for lifelong development and extends beyond cognitive development. This experimental study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two 9-week programs on promoting 73 preschool children’s CT and SEC, one using coding robots and the other using coding apps. The results showed that children who participated in the Coding Robot Program had higher CT scores than those in the Coding App Program, after controlling for age, gender, family socioeconomic status, and baseline CT scores. While the SEC scores showed no substantial disparities between the groups, it was revealed that the initial performance levels moderated the intervention effects on emotional regulation and overall SEC. This suggests that the Coding Robot Program could be especially advantageous for a subset of children who initially have difficulties with emotional regulation and social skills. Implications of this study are presented for research and practice.}

abstract = {In the past decade, Computational Thinking (CT) education has received growing attention from researchers. Although many reviews have provided synthesized information on CT teaching and learning, few have paid particular attention to collaborative learning (CL) strategies. CL has been widely implemented in CT classes and has become the most popular pedagogy among educators. Therefore, a systematic review of CL in CT classes would provide practical guidance on teaching strategies to enhance CT interventions and improve the quality of teaching and learning, ultimately benefiting students’ CT skills development. To address this gap, this study examined 43 empirical studies that have applied CL strategies, ranging from 2006 to 2022. Several findings were revealed in the analysis. First, a wide range of theories and frameworks were applied to inform research questions, pedagogical design, and research methodologies. Second, despite the acknowledged importance of group composition in effective CL, a large number of studies did not provide details on how the students were grouped. Third, six types of CL activities and instructional designs have been identified in CT classrooms. The synthesized information provides valuable insights that can inform future research directions and guide the design and implementation of CL activities in future CT classes.}

According to the findings obtained from pretests and posttests, a significant and positive difference was found in the students’ computational thinking skills and self-efficacy perceptions towards computational thinking skill. As a result of having received instruction in programming, the students satisfactorily learnt the required programming concepts and processes. Through learning Python programming with a physical programming tool, the students not only gained the skills required to write appropriate syntax, and to test and debug code, but they also learnt programming concepts such as variables, conditional expressions, loops, and functions.}

Previous studies have focused on physical, virtual and hybrid kits with virtual programming blocks, but rarely explored the use of hybrid kits that combine virtual sprites and physical programming environments. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to investigate the effect of using a hybrid programming kit on young children’s CT. Furthermore, we explored the characteristics of children’s programming engagement and the instructional strategies employed by teachers through video analysis and interviews. The results showed that: (1) children’s CT in the experimental group significantly improved, compared to that of peers in the control group; (2) children’s programming behaviour demonstrated a change from ‘action preceding thought’ to ‘thought preceding action’ and from ‘relying on trial and error’ to ‘active debugging’ with the support of teachers; (3) teachers used multiple strategies to support young children’s programming. These findings further indicate the importance of introducing programming in early childhood education and emphasize the critical role that teachers play in supporting young children’s learning of programming.}

A couple of CT instructional models have been proposed to depict the roles of CT in K-16 education. Yet, neither of them discussed CT infusion into a subject course. In this article, we proposed a CT-integration model called TPC2T. In this model, we suggested considering CT as a second subject and using an appropriate technological pedagogical approach to make students’ learning of two subjects meaningful and engaging. We implemented this model in a CT-integrated lesson in two sections of a high-school Spanish course. Students worked in small groups and coded three small and one comprehensive digital Spanish-culture stories in Scratch. Results showed that students taking the CT-integrated lesson had the same degree of improvement in their Spanish culture knowledge as their peers who did not take the CT-integrated lesson. Besides, students taking the CT-integrated lesson had a significant improvement in their CT knowledge. At the same time, their CT self-efficacy outperformed those who did not take the CT-integrated lesson. We discussed the results and offered suggestions for researchers and educators at the end of the article.}

abstract = {This paper examined the effect of the Unplugged Programming Teaching Aids (UPTA) on students’ computational thinking and classroom interaction. A set of UPTA was created and used in a primary school in southern China. A total of 48 students aged 6–8 were assigned to two classes, with the same instructor and learning materials, but only the treatment group was provided with the UPTA. Both groups were tested on computational thinking ability, children’s concrete operation status, degree of ego-centricity, and in-classroom interaction. Results indicated that the children aged 6–8 years old could classify things according to two kinds of criteria at the same time, but their cognitive style was still ego-centered and they found it difficult to deal with problems from a third-party perspective, no matter whether in the treatment group or the control group. However, students in the treatment group achieved significantly higher scores on the test of computational thinking and were more engaged in the classroom interaction patterns. These findings provide evidence of the positive effect of the UPTA on promoting children’s computational thinking by guiding them to decompose and solve problems, as well as enhancing their interaction and communication in the classroom, so as to transform from simple imitation to collaborative inquiry.}

abstract = {Due to the interdisciplinary nature of robotics, more and more attention has been paid to its effectiveness in the field of education in recent years. This systematic review evaluated existing studies in improving K-12 students’ computational thinking and STEM attitudes. Research articles published between 2010 and 2019 were collated from major databases according to six criteria, and 17 studies were eligible. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of educational robots in terms of standardized mean differences (SMD) or mean differences (MD) of test scores as outcome measures. The overall effect size was medium (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23–0.69). Subgroup analysis found that some groups to have better effectiveness. Specifically, the effect of STEM attitudes (SMD = 0.01) was smaller than computational thinking (SMD = 0.48). Educational robots had more significant effect on boys (MD = 0.39) than girls (MD = 0.27). The effect in primary school (SMD = 0.27) was higher than in middle school (SMD = 0.04), and the effect was great on short-term instruction with educational robots (SMD = 0.35). Based on these results, the study makes some recommendations for educators about strengthening the influence of educational robots on STEM attitudes, improving the persistence of their learning effects, and further exploring their application models.}

abstract = {Purpose To analyze mathematics problem-solving (PS) procedures in Chinese (CH) and Canadian (CA) elementary mathematics textbooks that leverage computational thinking (CT) as a cognitive tool, which have evidently existed and been implemented. Design/Approach/Methods In this study, an analysis framework was developed to investigate the characteristics of CT tools for three PS steps—understand the problem, devise and conduct plans, and look back into textbooks—in four contexts: data practices, modeling and simulation practices, computational tools practices, and systemic thinking practices. Findings Our results demonstrate the tools (CT) employed in the PS process in CH and CA mathematics textbooks. The strong connections between the “look back” stage and CT tools were explored. During the “look back” stage, both countries required students to transfer their knowledge and perform generalization. In addition, CT is regarded as a basic skill analysis for students in mathematics education and has received significant attention at every stage of the PS process. Originality/Value This study brings a new perspective to CT research in education by regarding CT as a cognitive tool for students in mathematics PS.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill for students, and assessment is a critical factor in education. However, there is a lack of effective approaches to CT assessment. Therefore, we designed the Three-Dimensional Integrated Assessment (TDIA) framework in this article. The TDIA has two aims: one was to integrate three dimensions (directionality, openness, and process) into the design of effective assessment tasks; and the other was to assess comprehensively the three dimensions of CT including computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Guided by the TDIA framework, we designed three pairs of tasks: closed forward tasks and closed reverse tasks, semiopen forward tasks and semiopen reverse tasks, and open tasks with a creative design report and open tasks without a creative design report. To further confirm each task’s applicability and its advantages and disadvantages, we conducted a test experiment at the end of the autumn semester in 2014 in a primary school for 3 weeks. The results indicated that (a) the reverse tasks were not more superior than the forward tasks; (b) the semiopen tasks and the open tasks were more effective than the closed tasks, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others; (c) the self-reports provided a helpful function for learning diagnosis and guidance; (d) the scores had no significant difference between the schoolboys and the schoolgirls in all six tasks; and (e) the six tasks’ difficulty and discrimination were all acceptable, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others. To effectively apply them, the following suggestions for teachers to design computational tasks are proposed: motivating students’ interest and enthusiasm, incorporating semifinished artifacts, involving learning diagnosis and guidance, and including multiple types of tasks in an assessment.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), an essential competency for comprehending and addressing intricate issues in the digital world, has been incorporated into curriculum planning as a goal for programming education. This study introduced flow design into programming curricula to investigate its impact on undergraduates ’CT skills during pair work. Two types of flow design approaches, construct-by-self flow design (CBS-FD) and construct-on-scaffold flow design (COS-FD), were proposed to determine which approach better enhances students’ CT skills. Seventy-six first-year undergraduates participated, including thirty in the CBS group and thirty-six in the COS group. Evaluations made from the results and processes of programming tasks were employed to describe computational performance and computational practices, respectively. Data gathered from CT skill surveys were thoroughly analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of computational perspectives. Our findings highlighted that COS-FD significantly improved participants’ computational performance compared with CBS-FD. The COS groups fostered an engaging, sharing atmosphere, while CBS groups spent more energy on negotiating the manipulation of flow design. Moreover, both COS-FD and CBS-FD proved beneficial in enhancing participants’ computational perspectives, with the COS groups better improving their algorithm thinking. The study presents valuable perspectives on the design and implementation of collaborative programming activities within curriculum education.}

abstract = {Computational thinking is a way of thinking that helps people “think like a computer scientist” to solve practical problems. However, practicing computational thinking through programming is dependent on the problem solvers’ metacognition. This study investigated students’ metacognitive planning and problem-solving performance in programming through two quantitative studies. First, we analyzed the performance of metacognitive planning and of problem solving through the programming of 21 freshmen, and found that the metacognitive planning performance related to “problem description” and “program comprehension” was significantly correlated with problem-solving performance. Second, semi-scaffolding and full-scaffolding were designed based on the first study. Another 89 freshmen were randomly divided into three groups and were asked to write their programming plan with no-scaffolding, semi-scaffolding, or with full-scaffolding. ANCOVA revealed that the problem-solving performance of the no-scaffolding group was significantly weaker than that of the other two groups, but there was no significant difference between the semi-scaffolding and the full-scaffolding groups. The study indicated that semi-scaffolding had a similar effect to full-scaffolding on problem-solving performance. The study suggests that teachers should emphasize supporting students’ “problem description” and “program comprehension” using semi-scaffolding. This scaffolding technique is sufficient and efficient for training students’ computational thinking through problem solving in programming.}

In recent years, an increasing number of individuals are now serving as sources of information that sparks public concern as it is considered to have lack of online quality control mechanisms. These mechanisms include the credentials of authors and information editorial teams. This paper aims to identify and develop an Islamic information credibility scale to examine the reliability of Islamic postings on social media, by acquiring the experts’ views and agreement on the elements in the proposed model by leveraging the Fuzzy Delphi process. A total of 15 experts from academic and related stakeholders participated in the verification of items through the questionnaire instrument’s 7-point linguistic scale by purposive sampling. Outcome of the study indicate that the appropriate criteria to evaluate the credibility of Islamic information on social media incline on the top four indicators, which are of the source of writing, accuracy, authority and authenticity of information. The result demonstrates the importance for referring to the source and content of information i.e., Quran and authentic hadith in the process to evaluate authentic Islamic information posting on social media, as opposed to the influence of the social environment. This study’s value lies in its contribution to the conceptualization and development of new Islamic information credibility scale through the screening and selection process of Fuzzy Delphi method approach. In future research, this scale should be explored to test new media credibility, as an emerging and promising approach to identifying and evaluating Islamic new media credibility.}

abstract = {The 10th annual International Conference of Students of Systematic Musicology (SysMus) took place on September 13–15, 2017, at Queen Mary University of London (UoL). The SysMus series has established itself as an international, student-run conference series aimed at introducing graduate students to networking and discussing their work in an academic conference environment. The term “Systematic Musicology,” first coined by Guido Adler (1885), nowadays covers a wide range of systematic or empirical approaches to theoretical, psychological, neuroscientific, ethnographic, and computational methodologies in music research. Presentations for SysMus17 focused on three central topics in relation to music: cognition and neuroscience, computation, and health and well-being. Each of these topics was the subject of workshops as well as keynotes by Prof. Lauren Stewart (Goldsmiths University of London and Music in the Brain Centre, Aarhus University), Prof. Elaine Chew and Dr. Marcus Pearce (both Queen Mary UoL), Dr. Daniel Müllensiefen (Goldsmiths UoL), and Prof. Aaron Williamon (Royal College of Music). Further presentations addressed issues relating to harmony and rhythm, musicians and performance, music and emotion, and sociology of music. This year’s conference brought together early-career researchers from the fields of musicology, psychology, and medicine, allowing them to socialize, share their work, and gain insight into interdisciplinary approaches to their subjects. SysMus17 was organized by students at Queen Mary’s Music Cognition Lab and was particularly marked by the series’ 10th anniversary, the live streaming of all presentations via social media, and a carbon-offsetting Green Initiative. The proceedings of SysMus17 will be available on demand from the conference website (www.sysmus17.qmul.ac.uk) and the videos will be made available for public access.}

This research, therefore, offers unique insights from semi-structured interviews with data journalists and data editors based at, or working as freelancers for, the mainstream news organisations of these regions. The results suggest that data journalism in these devolved nations displays a distinctive character just as much as it reinforces the norms and rituals of the legacy organisations that pioneered this practice. While various models of data exploitation are tested, regional data journalists creatively circumvent generalised organisational struggles to lay the groundwork for their trade and professional community.}

Methods: A total of 1,159 students were recruited. Structural equation analysis was performed using IBM Amos Graphics®. Results: Excellent fit indices were obtained, forming a final scale composed of nine indicators and two factors. The first dimension was associated with cognitive skills and adaptability, grouping together the skills of finding meaning, adaptable thinking, and understanding management. The second dimension comprises collaborative skills, as social intelligence and virtual collaboration. Discussion: Collaboration skills were more developed within those undertaking PT, while baccalaureate students had more strongly developed mastery over new media. This scale allows to know effectively the development of the work skills set by the European Union in the 2030 horizon. These findings contribute interesting data regarding the development of training strategies to support insertion into the job market.}

We synthesized comparisons of game versus nongame conditions (i.e., media comparisons) and comparisons of augmented games versus standard game designs (i.e., value-added comparisons). We used random-effects meta-regression models with robust variance estimates to summarize overall effects and explore potential moderator effects. Results from media comparisons indicated that digital games significantly enhanced student learning relative to nongame conditions ( = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [0.19, 0.48], k = 57, n = 209). Results from value-added comparisons indicated significant learning benefits associated with augmented game designs ( = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [0.17, 0.51], k = 20, n = 40). Moderator analyses demonstrated that effects varied across various game mechanics characteristics, visual and narrative characteristics, and research quality characteristics. Taken together, the results highlight the affordances of games for learning as well as the key role of design beyond medium.}

In an effort to address these issues, many digital games have been created to teach individuals about cybersecurity and keeping themselves, their data, and their networks safe. Intervention. We present the results of a systematic review of digital games related to cybersecurity as a means to understand how players are being introduced to cybersecurity in game-based contexts. Methods. Using a systematic search, we identified 181 games related to cybersecurity (either through content or aesthetics) by searching the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Steam, and the web broadly. Each game was played for up to an hour and characteristics such as the game story, game elements, and presentation of cybersecurity were gathered. Results. We found diverse conceptualizations of cybersecurity and of cybersecurity professionals. Further, the nature of games and the framing of cybersecurity varied by the platform and device on which the game was available (computer, mobile, or web). Web games were most likely to present cybersecurity as cyber safety and were more likely to be a gamified quiz or worksheet. Computer and mobile games tended to present cybersecurity through game aesthetics or deep content engagement. The games mirrored the underrepresentation of women and minoritized individuals in the field. Discussion. With the variety of digital cybersecurity games and the differences in games based on the platform on which the game is available, it is important game developers move beyond presenting cybersecurity through gamification and focusing on cyber safety. The current scope of cybersecurity games leaves room for the development of games focused on deeper content engagement with cybersecurity topics in an environment conducive to the broadening participation goals of the cybersecurity field.}

In this short essay, I discuss these opportunities with respect to four topics: (1) processes of mediation and representation, (2) systems perspectives on creative work, (3) methodological options for investigation, and (4) educational challenges that should be addressed. Considering design research’s contributions to each of these topics raises interesting questions that possibility studies might address as it develops. Conversely, possibility studies is already raising issues that design research should also attend to.}

abstract = {In this response to Ambrose, VanTassel-Baska, Coleman, and Cross’s (2010) thought-provoking article on the nature and state of the field of gifted education, the author first discusses the role of disciplinary knowledge in his field. He argues that gifted education, as a normative and practical endeavor (i.e., a profession), is different from academic disciplines in research agendas and that technical rationality is not sufficient for identifying its “best practice.” The author then suggests a “flat” structure to facilitate close collaboration between theorists, researchers, and practitioners in tackling pressing problems and fashioning innovative practices. To facilitate discussion of explorations in our practice, he delineates three basic service models or paradigms in gifted education as follows: the gifted child paradigm, the talent development paradigm, and the differentiation paradigm. He proposes five criteria for assessing their strengths and potential weaknesses. Finally, he suggests that the best way of providing evidence-based best practice is through use-inspired, design studies, which not only address the question of whether a practical model works but also specify goals, assumptions, resources, processes, and constraints involved so that “how it works” is made transparent.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent topic in K-12 education recently. However, pedagogical design has remained a major challenge, especially among young learners. Guided by the Zone of Proximal Development theory and AI education research literature, this design-based study proposes an analogy-based pedagogical approach to support AI teaching and learning in upper primary education. This pedagogical approach is centered on human–AI comparison, where humans are gradually shifted from an analogue to a contrast to make visible the attributes, mechanisms, and processes of AI. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental study with mixed methods was conducted. The quantitative comparison shows that the participants in the experimental group learning with the analogy-based pedagogical approach significantly outperformed their peers with the conventional direct instructional approach in all three dimensions of AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. Qualitative analyses further reveal its pedagogical benefits, including demystifying AI through relatable and engaging learning, supporting student comprehension and skill mastery, and nurturing critical thinking and attitudes. The analogy-based approach contributes to the field of K-12 AI education with an age-appropriate, child-friendly pedagogical approach. Notably, AI education should prioritize teaching for student understanding, and AI should be recognized as an independent subject with interdisciplinary applications.}

abstract = {This article describes a study of educational outcomes for 0- to 8-year-old children with blindness and low vision (BLV) who are learning sonification concepts. Children with BLV experience barriers to accessing education and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), fields which traditionally rely heavily on visual representation of information. There is growing awareness of the potential of sonification, a technology to represent data and information in non-speech audio, to improve education access. While early learning of assistive technology skills is deemed essential for equity of access to education across the curriculum, children are generally not introduced to the concept of sonification at school until at academic level in secondary or tertiary education. Little is known about how young children with BLV engage with this promising technology. First, ‘CosmoBally on Sonoplanet’ is introduced, an accessible, educational game application for iPads and Android tablets. Then findings are shared from an anonymous online survey that collected formal responses from users of this app, using a combination of Likert-type scale and open-ended questions. The majority of the 17 respondents were (specialist) educators, and five of the respondents identified as having BLV. The survey investigated respondents’ perceptions of the capabilities of young children with BLV in using basic sonification in ‘CosmoBally on Sonoplanet’ to identify shapes – including a circle – to orientate in a digital grid and to create drawings on a touch screen. Results suggest that young children with BLV can learn sonification skills and additionally may build relevant non-sonification skills during this learning process. This article aims to provide a first insight into best practice around early learning of sonification as a potential tool for increased access and inclusion of children with BLV to STEM subjects in school.}

abstract = {This article sheds light on the emerging forms of cultural capital that media practitioners need to acquire to work with automated news, as in Bourdieu’s understanding of unique abilities that include, among others, journalistic expertise and technical know-how. To uncover these new skills, we carried out 30 interviews with editorial staff, executives and technologists working at 23 media organisations based in Europe, North America and Australia. We show that these new forms of cultural capital are essentially two-fold: on the one hand, they involve taking a “structured journalism” approach so as to think of what an ideal story may look like, and then by breaking it down into smaller predictable elements that can be reusable across many versions of that same story; on the other hand, they also call for knowing how to embed a media organisation’s standards and practices into code for automated news. Overall this study argues that a new type of cultural capital emerges, as it is associated with the production of automated news. We call it the distinct-abstract capital, whereby journalism is thought of both as a one-off endeavour and as a process that can be deconstructed in an abstract way close to computer programming.}

While declaring this pipeline, the government assumes the needs of the economy and young people’s needs are (or should be) synchronised. We challenge this assumption and the policy it sustains with data from questionnaires, workshops and interviews with 50 young people from communities in South Wales (including a former mining town and a deprived inner city area) about digital technology’s role in their everyday life. We use a new typography to compare the reality of their socially and economically structured lives to the governmental policy discourse that makes them responsible for their country’s future economic success. To explain these young people’s creative and transgressive use of technology, we also make an empirically grounded contribution to the ongoing theoretical debates about structure and agency.}

STEM attitude scale and two entrepreneurial competency scales that were developed in different studies in the literature were used as data collection tools. In addition, a simple regression, a multiple regression and a stepwise multiple regression analysis were executed to analyse the data. The correlational analysis showed that there was a moderate level, positive correlation between the STEM attitudes of students and their overall entrepreneurial competencies. Also, the multiple regression analysis showed that entrepreneurial competencies consisting of professionalism, risk-taking, creativity and tenacity explained 41% of the change in STEM attitude. The stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that professionalism predicted the most the STEM attitude statistically more.}

We explore how the presence of small data within the social service contexts can result in extrapolation; if not properly considered, data science can negatively impact the organizations data scientists are trying to assist. We conclude by proposing three ways data scientists interested in working within the social services sector can enhance their contributions to the field: refining and leveraging available data, improving collaborations, and respecting data limitations.}

History is one of the subjects that simulations and games are used for promoting active learning and supporting students in comprehending various history-related subjects. Aim. This article reports on a new educational game on Greek mythology, called MYTH TROUBLES, designed and developed from scratch with the aim of supporting primary school students in studying Greek mythology and raising their interest on the subject of history. Method. The article presents the educational rationale and design of MYTH TROUBLES in the context of an educational games design model proposed in the literature. Since the game was implemented with the platform of Scratch and it is available online both for students (or anyone interested in Greek Mythology) and game developers, some information for its implementation is also provided. The results of a pilot evaluation of MYTH TROUBLES with the help of 21 experienced school teachers are presented, along with proposals for improvement and extension of the game. Results. Teachers evaluated positively MYTH TROUBLES in terms of acceptability, usability, utility as an educational tool, as well as its interface and game play and expressed their willingness to use it in the classroom. Conclusions. MYTH TROUBLES is considered appropriate by teachers for supporting the teaching and learning of Greek mythology and assessing its educational value in class is the next step. Scratch is appropriate for implementing such educational games and sharing them with interested players and game developers.}

There is evidence of four main trend topics (Data Literacy, Statistical Literacy, Data-based assessment and e-society) and six thematic clusters (Data Literacy, Statistical Literacy, Quantitative Literacy, Big Data, Data Science and Quantitative Skills). With DL emerging in 2011, the research initially focused on both quantitative and statistical literacy, and later (2012–2016) shifted toward applying statistical literacy to various disciplines. Since 2018, the use of data has led to the emergence of fields like big data and data science, resulting in progress being made in data literacy. The combination of the two analysis techniques offers complementary perspectives: co-word analysis reveals fields of application, and co-citation analysis shows the internal evolution of the discipline. This study evidences a significant increase in publications on DL, indicating its expansion to several disciplines and a promising, yet uncertain, future.}

abstract = {The Computer Science (CS) for All national movement is increasingly relying on state-level change to broaden participation in computing. To foster an environment in which all students have opportunities to thrive in CS education, policy action is necessary to help create the learning conditions for success. CS education in California has grown substantially in the last decade, yet opportunity gaps remain for young women and Black, Latinx, and Native American students. Early grassroots efforts to advance equity in computing evolved into the Computer Science for California coalition of K–16 educators, industry leaders, and other equity advocates to promote the growth of equity-minded teaching and learning opportunities in K–12 CS education. New policies at the state level reflect an increasing commitment among Sacramento policymakers to expand CS education. Yet troubling disparities in CS access and success continue to exist between traditionally advantaged students and their historically underserved peers. By drawing on interviews with 20 individuals involved in CS education policy, this study illuminates the contributing factors to recent policy successes and considerations for achieving further progress. Interviewees described the importance of tapping into the values of influential decision makers, educating policymakers about the benefits of CS education, and identifying the problems and solutions that require policy attention. To build the capacity of key policy actors in making informed decisions, this research demonstrates the continued value of providing useful information, developing relationships with policymakers, and creating resources that are easy to consume and understand. The interviews also suggest that attention to funding, disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, equity, and ongoing stakeholder support will shape prospects for CS education policy success moving forward.}

Following other disciplines that have developed in symbiotic relationships to one another, DCS puts computation in conversation with fields from across the arts, humanities, physical, and social sciences. Our foundational premise is the bidirectional influence between these disciplines and digital artifacts and computation. The 4As (artifact, architecture, abstraction, and agency) benefit from both the scepticism of the liberal arts in the face of ubiquitous digital processes and the analytical opening for examining questions pertaining to creative and imaginative alternatives to the digital and computational status quo. We provide an ultra-contemporary case study to demonstrate the framework in use.}

abstract = {Block-based visual programming tools, such as Scratch, Alice, and MIT App Inventor, provide an intuitive and easy-to-use editing interface through which to promote programming learning for novice students of various ages. However, very little attention has been paid to investigating these tools’ overall effects on students’ academic achievement and the study features that may moderate the effects of block-based visual programming from a comprehensive perspective. Thus, the present study carried out a meta-analysis to systemically examine 29 empirical studies (extracting 34 effect sizes) using experimental or quasi-experiments involving the programming learning effects of employing block-based visual programming tools to date (until the end of 2019). The results showed a small to medium significant positive overall mean effect size (fixed-effect model g = 0.37; random-effects model g = 0.47) of the use of these block-based visual programming tools with respect to students’ academic achievement. Furthermore, the overall mean effect size was significantly affected by the educational stage, programming tool used, experimental treatment, and school location. Discussions and implications based on the findings are provided.}

abstract = {Fostering students’ computer programming skills has become an important educational issue in the globe. However, it remains a challenge for students to understand those abstract concepts when learning computer programming, implying the need to provide instant learning diagnosis and feedback in computer programming activities. In this study, a Two-Tier Test-Based Programming Training (T3PT) approach was proposed. Accordingly, an online learning system was developed to provide students with precision feedback for guiding them to identify misconceptions of computer programming to improve their computer programming learning achievement. In order to examine the effects of the proposed approach, a learning system was developed and a quasi-experiment was conducted. Two classes of 99 eighth-grade students from Taiwan were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students in the experimental group used the learning system based on the T3PT approach, while the control group used the conventional learning system. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was significantly superior to the conventional programming learning approach in terms of students’ programming logic concepts, problem-solving awareness, technology acceptance, and satisfaction with the learning approach. Accordingly, discussion and suggestions are provided for future research.}

abstract = {We propose a minimum learning judgment system that is appropriate for online learning environments, and we verify this minimum learning judgment system through various experiments. By focusing on the learning effort, this system can easily and quickly determine whether learners have exerted the minimum effort required for learning. To do this, the system automatically generates a word game and determines whether minimum learning has taken place through the results of the word game. To verify the minimum learning judgment system, we conducted a comparative experiment on the importance of high-frequency words, a word count verification test for word games, and a judgment criteria verification test based on the length of a video lecture. Results of the experiments show that high-frequency words can be used as a feature to determine minimum learning. The appropriate number of words in the word game for the minimum learning judgment was found to be seven, and the results showed that the video length did not affect the minimum learning criteria. In addition, the minimum learning judgment accuracy result was 82%. This is not considered very high judgment accuracy, but the accuracy of the judgment is positive considering the aim of this study.}

The data were collected from children’s essays, which were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results reveal that children’s learning experiences are often related to 21st-century core subjects and skills, but they also reported improved physical abilities and sports competences from digital games. Children felt that the skills they had gained were beneficial in the contexts of school, sports, and friendships. The results contribute to our understanding of digital games and children by providing children’s perspective on digital games and learning.}

abstract = {The increasing availability of remote education opportunities enables students to access different types of study programs limited by the dimensions of a classroom. Remote learning has been accredited as an effective technique for delivering education to students and teachers globally. However, some academic disciplines such as Computer Science are abounding with many challenges in practicing programming tasks in remote settings. This research aims to understand the students’ existing setup for practicing JAVA programming in remote settings and proposes an intervention to help students get appropriate hints to fix compiler errors. The proposed solution has implications for both students and teachers, as it is under the teacher’s direct observation. The teacher can monitor the content according to students’ needs, which may potentially save them from teaching challenges. To formulate our study, we first surveyed to understand the challenges that students face in JAVA programming when trying to fix errors in a remote setting. Then, based on the results of the first survey and prior experience of conducting programming course practicals along with the existing literature, the proposed web portal was created and presented to the students to fix errors. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the proposed setup followed by a student attitude survey. The results show the portal’s leverage in reducing the time required to fix errors and the number of compilation attempts. The survey indicates a positive response.}

Qualitative analysis based on acculturation theory revealed three salient themes of leisure benefits: (a) creating a sense of belonging, (b) increasing psychological well-being, and (c) facilitating acculturation. The results indicate that participants gained social and psychological benefits through leisure activities. They also suggest that the provision of recreation programs that encourage inter/intragroup participation can be an important component of these young refugees’ cultural and social adjustment.}

This study analyzed the United States nationally representative data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) to examine associations between adult skills and having a STEM degree for people with and without disabilities. No direct associations were found between adult skills and having a STEM degree for people with learning disabilities or for people without disabilities. These groups’ information processing, literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills were not determining factors in STEM degree attainment. However, findings suggest a significant association between problem-solving skills and having a STEM degree for people with visual and/or hearing impairments. Policy implications are discussed.}

First, we provide an overview of the unique contributions of the report to move the ELs and STEM fields forward. Second, we describe ELs in terms of their heterogeneity and the inconsistency of educational policies that affect their learning opportunities in STEM subjects. Third, we describe contemporary views on STEM subjects and language with ELs that indicate that instructional shifts across STEM subjects and language are mutually supportive. Fourth, we describe promising instructional strategies to promote STEM learning and language development with ELs. Lastly, we close the article by reimagining STEM education with ELs and offer potential next steps. These foundational constructs and perspectives on STEM subjects and language with ELs are critical because they provide the conceptual grounding for the design of the education system for ELs. The report could contribute to building a knowledge base for ELs in STEM subjects and language as education research, policy, and practice converge to reimagine what is possible to both support and challenge ELs to learn academically rigorous content standards that are expected of all students.}

A sample of Chinese high school students (N = 560) completed questionnaires assessing academic self-efficacy, academic buoyancy, peer support, and test anxiety. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed an indirect effect of academic self-efficacy on test anxiety through academic buoyancy. Moreover, the results of the conditional process analysis demonstrated that this indirect effect was moderated by peer support. The findings suggested that both personal positive psychological characteristics (e.g., academic buoyancy) and school environmental factors (e.g., peer support) are protective factors for test anxiety in high school students. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.}

abstract = {Pair Programming is considered an effective approach to programming education, but the synchronous collaboration of two programmers involves complex coordination, making this method difficult to be widely adopted in educational settings. Artificial Intelligence (AI) code-generation tools have outstanding capabilities in program generation and natural language understanding, creating conducive conditions for pairing with humans in programming. Now some more mature tools are gradually being implemented. This review summarizes the current status of educational applications and research on AI-assisted programming technology. Through thematic coding of literature, existing research focuses on five aspects: underlying technology and tool introduction, performance evaluation, the potential impacts and coping strategies, exploration of behavioral patterns in technological application, and ethical and safety issues. A systematic analysis of current literature provides the following insights for future academic research related to the practice of “human-machine pairing” in programming: (1) Affirming the value of AI code-generation tools while also clearly defining their technical limitations and ethical risks; (2) Developing adaptive teaching ecosystems and educational models, conducting comprehensive empirical research to explore the efficiency mechanisms of AI-human paired programming; (3) Further enriching the application of research methods by integrating speculative research with empirical research, combining traditional methods with emerging technologies.}

The study aims to analyze the development and implementation of a hybrid AR and VR educational system designed to enhance training and learning outcomes across various educational settings. A total of 238 students from universities participated in the study. The participant is randomly assigned into two groups: the experimental group, which interacts with the AR and VR hybrid earning systems, and the control group, which engages in traditional classroom-based learning. Survey data were gathered on student satisfaction, perceived learning effectiveness, and overall experience using the hybrid AR and VR system. Through empirical assessments, this study assesses the hybrid approach’s efficacy in a range of educational situations by gauging how it affects student engagement, retention of information, and skill development. The data analyze the statistical methods, including t-tests, regression analyses, descriptive statistics, and ANOVA, to determine significant differences between the groups. The data is analyzed by the SPSS software. The results reveal that the integration of AR and VR significantly not only enhances the educational experience but also supports diverse learning styles and improves overall learning outcomes. This study contributes to the expanding literature of study on educational technology by shedding light on the training and instructional applications of AR and VR that are performing well and by promoting their greater integration into the academic curriculum.}

abstract = {This article explores the use of modding as a formal tool for learning history. The article examines data from a formal analysis of Europa Universalis IV (EUIV), a survey of 331 EUIV forum participants and a case study of 18 university participants. Significant quantitative survey data indicated that 45% (149/331) of participants had modified EUIV, and of the 125 participants who responded with comments about modding, a significant number (86/125 responses or 68.8%) explained how they had learnt about history, geography or other subjects through the modding process. Closer analysis of survey and case study responses and mods reveals the variety of ways participants learnt and critiqued history through the modding process. The article discusses the data and the pedagogical affordance of modding in a few steps. First, the article briefly explores the evidence that indicates modding is popular within the EUIV gaming community. In this instance, it examines whether given the popularity of gaming practice, modding might also be seen as a new casual form of engagement with games. Second, the article reviews the modding process in EUIV and examines how both playing and creating mods may be beneficial for learning history. Modding is examined in terms of its pedagogical importance and the unique educational opportunities it may offer that are not otherwise accessible through other forms of game-based learning. Finally, the article explores how and what the case study participants learnt when they were tasked with creating and implementing playable mods to demonstrate their understanding of history. Overall, the article considers the growing importance of mods, how learners can create and represent history using mods and how mods can provide a platform for learners to develop their own critique and analysis of official history.}

abstract = {Austria is a country without college tuition fees, also allowing students to enroll in an unlimited number of programs simultaneously. Based on minimum ECTS requirements to keep enrollments valid, student performance is central. This study explores associations between student satisfaction and performance in the setting of parallel enrollments. Two hundred and thirteen students filled in a questionnaire, merging answers with performance parameters from the university’s database. Multivariate regression analyses with performance as outcome and satisfaction measures as predictors were conducted on the levels: (1) unfiltered dataset, (2) one enrollment, and (3) 2 + enrollments. Performance satisfaction explained variance of grade point average and the number of failed exams on levels 1 and 2. Course satisfaction and the wish to continue studying were strongly associated with grade point average in nonprioritized programs of students with more than one enrollment. University systems worldwide could benefit from parallel programs, possibly preventing immediate dropout of unsatisfied students.}

While the hack transcends existing literatures on the digital and informality, it is a distinctive concept and is being used systematically in new domains. I situate the hack conceptually, outline its empirical and methodological value and propose a framework to research the urban hack. Importantly, it is not just the technologies of hacking but the translation of computational logics to the urban that underpins the importance of the hack, as well as the critical need to set out a research agenda surrounding the hack within urban studies.}

However, the teacher is an essential component of how the students engage with the technology, as they embed the IVE into everyday teaching and learning. Ideally, classroom pedagogies would reflect the scientific practices modeled in the IVE to the best extent possible. In this case study, we explore how one teacher enacted authentic scientific practices after 3 years of IVE implementations plus participation in the corresponding professional development (PD) experience. Although the teacher believed that the inquiry practices modeled in the IVE and the PD were an important part of his teaching, these beliefs were not transferred into practice. Our findings suggest that PD should include opportunities for teachers to reflect on their own practice integrating technology and consider external factors contributing to pedagogical change beyond PD.}

abstract = {The use of a pedagogical approach mediated transfer with the bridging method has been successful in facilitating the transitions from block-based to text-based programming languages. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research addressing the impact of this transfer on programming misconceptions during the transition. The way programming concepts are taught to K-12 learners can later result in misconceptions for adult learners. The main objective was to examine the impact of mediated transfer using the bridging method pedagogical approach on the prevalence of programming misconceptions. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in school settings during informatics (computer science) classes among 163 sixth-grade students. The control group received traditional programming lectures using the text-based programming language, Python. Conversely, the experimental group utilized a mediated transfer pedagogical approach by starting with the block-based programming language MakeCode for micro:bit before transitioning to the text-based Python. Our findings indicate that the experimental group significantly reduced programming misconceptions in fundamental programming concepts: variables, sequencing, selection, and loops - compared to the control group. This suggests that the use of block-based programming language as an initial step in programming education, followed by a structured transition to text-based programming language, can effectively mitigate common misconceptions among K-12 learners.}

This paper explores the question: if those studies were based on participants born several technology-generations earlier, does this research need an update? Children now have greater access to smartphones and STEM outreach opportunities than before, which may have shifted girls’ technology learning preferences. This research found that most studies about gender and tinkering were conducted before 2006, revealing a research gap about younger generations. Future work could explore whether preferences to learn by process or by tinkering are still disproportionately represented in different genders. This work has implications for how human factors professionals design gender-inclusive products and training.}

AI for learning provides many applications and multimodal channels for supporting people in cognitive and non-cognitive task domains. The articles in this special issue evidence that agency, engagement, self-efficacy, and collaboration are needed in learning and working with intelligent tools and environments. The importance of social elements is also clear in the articles. The articles also point out that the teacher’s role in digital pedagogy primarily involves facilitating and coaching. AI in learning has a high potential, but it also has many limitations. Many worries are linked with ethical issues, such as biases in algorithms, privacy, transparency, and data ownership. This special issue also highlights the concepts of explainability and explicability in the context of human learning.

abstract = {Algorithmic media have adopted and adapted divinatory practices and vernaculars of prediction, prophecy, probability, fortune-telling and forecasting – suggesting a possible link between artificial intelligence and pre-scientific modes of speculation. Statistical thinking and magical thinking, too, can be recognised as closely correlated epistemological systems for governing societies and ways of life. In fact, primitive astrological practices of looking up at the stars may represent one of the earliest statistical projects involving sophisticated calculations and data sets. Such pattern-making techniques could even be considered precursory to machine learning. As a point of departure for exploring these eclectic relationships between stars and data, magic and machines, I use a media archaeological methodology to question the historical roles of both astrological and computational divination in mediating methods of control, surveillance and knowledge production across transforming societal contexts. This methodology is especially relevant for examining historical narratives in the field of cultural studies as it makes apparent the hyper-connectedness between objects, cultural representation and sites of hegemonic contention. My findings reveal relationships between celestial pattern recognition and efforts to exert control over and manipulate the natural environment and its populations, the historical impact of meteorological and climatological practices for predicting and influencing future events with artificial intelligence, and links between statistics and algorithmic data biases. This article suggests a speculative genealogy of astrology and artificial intelligence, as well as a genealogy of the theological, scientific and machinic unconscious.}

We provide an overview of the talent development megamodel as an exemplar of talent development frameworks and discuss ways to tailor it to fit CS talent trajectories. We describe three key components in a CS talent trajectory: early access to materials and programs; support from mentors; and the development of psychosocial skills. We introduce a proposed model, the computer science talent development model (CSTDM), for finding and developing talents in computer science in K–12 settings. CSTDM includes advanced STEM learning opportunities beginning in middle school, a focus on the development of psychosocial skills, and guidance for students regarding STEM career development.}

This study explored one aspect of CS teachers’ understanding of student misconceptions: their perceptions of student misconceptions related to introductory programming. Perceptions in this study included three parts: teachers’ perceived frequency of a student misconception, teachers’ perceived importance of a misconception in learning, and teachers’ confidence in addressing a misconception. Teachers in our study taught a Python-based CS course for high schools students. A survey was designed and administered to assess teachers’ perceptions of students’ misconceptions. Our results indicated that teachers’ confidence of addressing misconceptions and the teaching context may affect their perceptions of student misconceptions. We also found that some latent misconceptions are likely to lead to a perception of low frequency as they can be more difficult to detect. Moreover, our study found that teachers’ degrees and additional computing training showed positive relationships with their confidence of addressing student misconceptions and that additional computing training also showed a positive relationship with teachers’ perceived importance of student misconceptions. Implications of the findings for future research and practice of CS education are discussed.}

Students’ error-related behaviors were also analyzed, and their relationships to success in introductory programming were investigated. This study identified 15 common compilation errors and 6 common test errors. The results showed that these common errors accounted for a large proportion of all errors, so identifying the common errors is important to help students succeed in introductory programming courses. Based on these common errors, five underlying student difficulties were identified and are discussed. In addition, after analyzing existing measures of students’ error-related behaviors, we developed a measure called improvement rate to quantify students’ success in fixing errors. The results of our study suggest that students’ competence of improving code is important to their success in introductory programming. We recommend researchers design and develop automated assessment tools that provide feedback messages for common student errors and instructors who explicitly teach knowledge and skills of improving code in class.}

abstract = {Background/Context: Bi/multilingual students’ STEM learning is better supported when educators leverage their language and cultural practices as resources, but STEM subject divisions have been historically constructed based on oppressive, dominant values and exclude the ways of knowing of nondominant groups. Truly promoting equity requires expanding and transforming STEM disciplines. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article contributes to efforts to illuminate emergent bi/multilingual students’ ways of knowing, languaging, and doing in STEM. We follow the development of syncretic literacies in relation to translanguaging practices, asking, How do knowledges and practices from different communities get combined and reorganized by students and teachers in service of new modeling practices? Setting and Participants: We focus on a seventh-grade science classroom, deliberately designed to support syncretic literacies and translanguaging practices, where computer science concepts were infused into the curriculum through modeling activities. The majority of the students in the bilingual program had arrived in the United States at most three years before enrolling, from the Caribbean and Central and South America. Research Design: We analyze one lesson that was part of a larger research–practice partnership focused on teaching computer science through leveraging translanguaging practices and syncretic literacies. The lesson was a modeling and computing activity codesigned by the teacher and two researchers about post–Hurricane María outmigration from Puerto Rico. Analysis used microethnographic methods to trace how students assembled translanguaging, social, and schooled practices to make sense of and construct models. Findings/Results: Findings show how students assembled representational forms from a variety of practices as part of accomplishing and negotiating both designed and emergent goals. These included sensemaking, constructing, explaining, justifying, and interpreting both the physical and computational models of migration. Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications support the development of theory and pedagogy that intentionally make space for students to engage in meaning-making through translanguaging and syncretic practices in order to provide new possibilities for lifting up STEM learning that may include, but is not constrained by, disciplinary learning. Additional implications for teacher education and student assessment practices call for reconceptualizing schooling beyond day-to-day curriculum as part of making an ontological shift away from prioritizing math, science, and CS disciplinary and language objectives as defined by and for schooling, and toward celebrating, supporting, and centering students’ diverse, syncretic knowledges and knowledge use.}

Training demands are thus arising for specific skills and competencies that would make current students and employment seekers more employable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the twenty-first century’s major employability skills and competencies as well as the main demand trends for skills and competencies. METHODS: An international panel of experts (from Spain, Thailand and Poland), from both, academic and professional business backgrounds, were asked to quantitatively project the importance of different generic and specific skills and competencies over the next five years. They were asked to do so twice, once before and once after a four-year interval (in 2016 and in 2019). Each time, they were interviewed to discuss the results. RESULTS: The most valued employability skills were of a generic nature, in all three countries. Regarding specific skills, those of a social and managerial nature were the most highly valued. Work experience and formal education became less relevant for employability. CONCLUSIONS: The study’s results can lead to recommendations on how to design a more employability-oriented curriculum in educational institutions.}

As Raul developed his original game, You Will Perish, I wondered what his design process might reveal about (a) the practice of affectively and procedurally literate video game design and (b) the literacy pedagogies that can support such design. Guided by the concept of serendipity, I describe Raul’s design practice as an open process characterized by bouts of failure, chance, and discovery, and I examine how such forces shaped the emergence of his game. Using transversal analysis, I trace Raul’s design through an account of frustration and failure, perseverance and pride, showing how the challenges of the game’s creator become those of the game’s players. The study highlights the generative potential of serendipitous literacies wherever and whenever literacy happens.}

abstract = {The comprehensiveness of teacher professional identity (TPI) studies conducted by African and Asian researchers highlights the importance of valid TPI indicators across Africa and Asia. Questionnaire TPI indicators are important to obtain valid direct comparisons between teachers in Africa and Asia. The process of developing a questionnaire served as an avenue for researchers from Asian and African regions to learn about TPI pointers from each other. This study used the Delphi technique to achieve consensus on valid TPI indicators across African and Asian regions. Fourteen researchers from the Asia-Africa University Dialogue Network for Educational Development (AAD) were selected using purposive sampling. TPI in this study is defined as a multifaceted concept comprising contextual and personal factors that differ across national borders. The indicators in the questionnaire represented personal, social and institutional factors perceived by teachers and outlined in the literature. In the Delphi study process, the researchers used three rounds to validate the initial 40-item TPI questionnaire. Subsequent analysis of the results indicated high importance and consensus among experts. Owing to its standardized procedure, the TPI questionnaire makes it possible to collect and compare the TPI dimensions from the different socio-economic contexts in which teachers work in Africa and Asia. The findings of this study guide African and Asian researchers on the common understanding of TPI characteristics prevalent across African and Asian regions. Research protocols for fostering quality research toward addressing challenges faced by the teacher education sector in African and Asian countries is also implied.}

abstract = {This study explored teacher experience in leading Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) in K-12 and conducting blended synchronous and asynchronous instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study’s purpose was to understand the pedagogical, technological, and organizational challenges and benefits of computing-enhanced digital learning environments, and to explore teachers’ pedagogical strategies. This study employed a qualitative research paradigm using nation-wide, online samples, which included 133 elementary and secondary school teachers from Hebrew-speaking and Arabic-speaking schools in Israel. Participants were asked to share their perspectives and experiences of ERT through open-ended questions in an online questionnaire. The bottom-up analysis of the data, based on the Grounded Theory approach, yielded 1,822 statements reflecting teachers’ perceptions of pedagogical, technological, and organizational challenges (N = 580) and benefits of ERT (N = 827). The analysis also revealed a variety of pedagogical distance learning strategies used by teachers (N = 415). The study raises the need to turn a curse into a blessing by incorporating the experience of remote technology-enhanced learning and online activities into the school agenda on a regular basis. Thus, teachers and students would develop important digital competencies and be prepared for the next emergency event. The implications of our findings for educational theory and practice of educational computing are discussed.}

abstract = {This study explores the effect of self-regulated learning support on learners’ cognitive load and problem-solving performance, considering cases from well-structured to ill-structured tasks in a computer programing course. Sixty-seven undergraduate students in a computer programing fundamentals course were randomly assigned into one of two groups: (1) experimental group (N = 34; received self-regulated learning support) and (2) control group (N = 33). Participants in both groups were asked to solve programing problems using Python over 3 weeks, and their cognitive load levels were measured after each week. The results showed that novice learners’ self-regulated learning skills can be influenced by learning support, which contributes to solving complex problems. The results also suggest that, given the sequence of tasks (i.e., basic and advanced well-structured and ill-structured problems), self-regulated learning support may require time to be effective. The germane load of the experimental group was higher for well-structured problems than that of the control group. Using logistic regression, the two groups were differentiated through different variables measured in this study, which showed a high predictive explanatory power. The results provide implications for designing self-regulated learning support for programing courses, using problem-based learning in association with problem-solving skills, self-regulated learning skills, and cognitive load management.}

abstract = {Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.}

abstract = {Information and communications technology (ICT) is crucial in any contemporary society, especially if its online presence is to be widely significant, but, in a national context, it is important to investigate whether there is a compelling ICT ‘politic’ in the education sector in Turkey. This study specifically focuses on the ICT for Educational Development (ICT4ED) (Fatih) project, valued at US$8 billion, which is an embodiment of future educational reform in centralist Turkey. The study investigates the level of policy-making capacity within the scope of the Fatih project, which promises to fully integrate ICT into education in order to solve many educational issues, such as establishing entrepreneurialism in education, improving ICT sectors, exporting educational services to other nations for profit, and, ultimately, meeting the overarching purpose of Turkey becoming a competitive nation. The discourse of the government is to explore technological opportunities within education in order to create new ‘profitable’ avenues that conceive education as a ‘commodity’ and a ‘private good’, which is another feature of fragmented centralisation through public-private partnership(s) for both covert and overt privatisations. While the Fatih project defines the future as having new, ‘fully integrated ICT in education’, this study presents three main normative arguments — with regard to the project’s political execution, technical development and philosophical conception — to refute its objectives and highlight that it is destined to fail, and to suggest what urgent matters the ICT4ED politic should highlight in future education.}

The construction of the items was based on the educational theory of Self-Regulated Learning. The final version of the questionnaire, called the Computer Programming Learning Strategies Questionnaire (CEAPC), was administered to 647 students enrolled in computer programming courses. The data collected from the participants were used to examine the construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The CEAPC consists of 13 subscales, each corresponding to a different type of learning strategy, and a total of 89 items. Statistical analyses of the data indicate that the CEAPC has adequate construct validity. In addition, the results of the internal consistency analysis indicate satisfactory reliability across the different subscales of the instrument. This study contributes to the field of educational research, particularly in the area of self-regulated learning in computer programming.}

The game Code Hasp was developed to facilitate the comparison between two support methods, worked examples and a collaborative peer support approach. A total of 111 elementary school students participated, divided into two groups. The experimental group received collaborative support from teammates alongside worked examples, while the control group relied solely on worked examples. Pre- and post-test results and in-game data revealed that the collaborative support method improved learning efficiency and problem-solving skills. A notable effect of the process was the emergence of a leadership role in most collaborative groups. The game’s support design and shared goal structure mitigate potential problems associated with unbalanced participation. These findings suggest that collaborative support systems in serious games are a promising strategy for promoting engagement and improving learning outcomes in programming education.}

This study used the GAME model (gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry) in a programming education course to enhance undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. There were 83 undergraduates taking part in this study, which adopted a quasi-experimental research design. Students in the experimental group (n = 43) experienced a course in which the GAME model was used to design the block-based programming course. The control group (n = 40) was given a general information education course covering similar learning concepts without the game-based learning strategy. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to investigate the effect of the GAME model on students’ learning outcomes for the quantitative data. In the qualitative analysis, students’ responses to the course perception questionnaire were coded and analyzed. The results showed that students in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts regarding self-efficacy and basic programming concepts. The experimental treatment resulted in a small to medium effect size difference between the two groups. The results showed that incorporating the GAME model into block-based programming teaching helped improve undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. In addition, these experimental group undergraduates also perceived the pedagogic GAME model positively. Several research suggestions are proposed based on the findings of the present study.}

All of the students stated that they had not previously encountered an activity such as the “smart air conditioning system”. The students also stated that although the activity was carried out in the form of distance education, it was positive and fun to be application-based, and that it was fun to research, discuss, design, and code with Tinkercad to look for a solution to the given problem. The evaluation of students’ products showed participants’ high level of proficiency in activities requiring advanced problem-solving skills, including planning the solution to the problem, creating an alternative plan for the solution, realizing, and evaluating the design.}

Utilizing a quasi-experimental research design, this study compared students’ programming learning achievements (PLA), self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, learning beliefs, and learning motivation in MetaClassroom with those in traditional classroom settings. The findings revealed that MetaClassroom significantly enhanced students’ PLA and SRL skills, particularly in subdimensions including Metacognitive Skills, Persistence, and Seeking Help. Additionally, MetaClassroom positively impacted students’ learning beliefs and learning motivation, demonstrating its potential in optimizing knowledge acquisition, application processes, and fostering students’ higher-order thinking skills. By integrating the 3DLP concept into targeted programming learning environments, MetaClassroom created an innovative immersive learning ecosystem, that bridged theory and practice, offering students a comprehensive and engaging platform to develop both foundational knowledge and practical skills. This study not only validated the effectiveness of MetaClassroom in improving students’ programming learning performance and learning experience, but also introduced a new paradigm that integrated teaching, learning, and assessment. The paradigm offers new insights and directions for both programming education and broader educational practices, paving the way for future developments in educational technology.}

Specifically, this study aimed to examine what and how achievement emotions were aroused to impact learners’ academic success during Scratch implementation processes by employing regression analyses. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduates (Mage = 20.44, SDage = 1.09, 55.8% female) were voluntarily recruited to participate in a Scratch-based instruction workshop during a 6-week period. The workshop was structured with regard to preparation, Scratch-based programming learning and projects, and assessment activities and questionnaire implemented both before the instructional period and after the workshop. The results suggested that the Scratch-based intervention significantly increased students’ overall motivation and examination performance. Concerning achievement emotions, the outcome emotion of hopelessness first negatively predicted students’ motivation and performance. Anxiety then replaced hopelessness as a negative predictor, while enjoyment was the strongest predictor of motives and performance. Taking eight emotions together, the arousal of activity and outcome emotions within visual programming environments facilitated students’ emotion dynamics that impacted motivation and performance. The discussion and contributions concerning the mechanism behind the effectiveness of visualization and the emotion-performance relationship are presented herein.}

abstract = {Creativity, one of the cornerstones of students’ 21st-century skills, is regarded as an important learning outcome of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education. Meanwhile, problem-based digital making (DM), which combines the child-friendly programming activities of DM with problem-solving elements, is an emerging instructional design to facilitate STEAM learning. This qualitative case study examines the implementation of a problem-based DM instructional program that used the block-based programming tool Scratch to cultivate the participants’ creativity. Fifty-four middle school students (aged 10–14 years) in Hong Kong participated in the program, which totaled 10 contact hours over five consecutive weeks. Through triangulating students’ DM artifacts, video recordings, field notes, and interviews, the researchers characterized the students’ creative expression, examined the role of problem-based DM in encouraging creative work, and investigated the use of Scratch for mediating student creativity. The results showed that problem-based DM activities fostered students’ creative expressions in the dimensions of novelty, utility, aesthetics, and authenticity. While Scratch mediated the way the students presented their solutions, it had limitations that hindered the students’ digital artifact construction. The findings provide theoretical insights for framing creativity and offer practical implications for the implementation of problem-based DM in K–12 contexts.}

abstract = {Coupled with the ‘smart city’, the idea of the ‘smart school’ is emerging in imaginings of the future of education. Various commercial, governmental and civil society organizations now envisage education as a highly coded, software-mediated and data-driven social institution. Such spaces are to be governed through computational processes written in computer code and tracked through big data. In an original analysis of developments from commercial, governmental and civil society sectors, the article examines two interrelated dimensions of an emerging smart schools imaginary: (1) the constant flows of digital data that smart schools depend on and the mobilization of analytics that enable student data to be used to anticipate and shape their behaviours; and (2) the ways that young people are educated to become ‘computational operatives’ who must ‘learn to code’ in order to become ‘smart citizens’ in the governance of the smart city. These developments constitute an emerging educational space fabricated from intersecting standards, technologies, discourses and social actors, all infused with the aspirations of technical experts to govern the city at a distance through both monitoring young people as ‘data objects’ and schooling them as active ‘computational citizens’ with the responsibility to compute the future of the city.}

abstract = {This commentary lays out a framework for building on early critical cartographic and critical geographic information system work to develop a critical approach for the computational future of geographical thought and praxis. Computation – as a highly representational and structural form which combines speech and action – is a very particular way of building worlds. As computation becomes more prevalent in critiques of deep fakes, GeoAI, and platform geographies, geographers have also developed the foundations for a critical computational approach with an explicitly spatial or geographical focus that combines both theory and practice. Yet, while many of the technological affordances of spatial computation are relatively novel, the critiques raised by social, political, economic, and cultural geographers shadow debates that emerged two decades ago between cartographers and geospatial scientists about the power and praxis of mapping as it becomes translated into a digital era. This commentary argues that by returning to these debates, as well as critique by Black, queer, and Indigenous computing seen in other disciplines, geographers find themselves in a moment of opportunity to deeply influence the future of computation via a situated, critical geographical thought and praxis.}

abstract = {Integrating engineering design into K-12 curricula is increasingly important as engineering has been incorporated into many STEM education standards. However, the ill-structured and open-ended nature of engineering design makes it difficult for an instructor to keep track of the design processes of all students simultaneously and provide personalized feedback on a timely basis. This study proposes a Bayesian network model to dynamically and automatically assess students’ engagement with engineering design tasks and to support formative feedback. Specifically, we applied a Bayesian network to 111 ninth-grade students’ process data logged by a computer-aided design software program that students used to solve an engineering design challenge. Evidence was extracted from the log files and fed into the Bayesian network to perform inferential reasoning and provide a barometer of their performance in the form of posterior probabilities. Results showed that the Bayesian network model was competent at predicting a student’s task performance. It performed well in both identifying students of a particular group (recall) and ensuring identified students were correctly labeled (precision). This study also suggests that Bayesian networks can be used to pinpoint a student’s strengths and weaknesses for applying relevant science knowledge to engineering design tasks. Future work of implementing this tool within the computer-aided design software will provide instructors a powerful tool to facilitate engineering design through automatically generating personalized feedback to students in real time.}

Design/Approach/Methods: The study is an analytical policy review based on the policy documents, theoretical discussion, and development of practice. Findings: This new Chinese education informatization policy was driven by three factors: the promotion of education informatization 1.0 in China, the requirement of education modernization toward 2035, and the response to “Wisdom Education.” The framework for action can be summarized as “One Goal, Three Tasks, and Eight Actions.” The main features involve innovation-driven development rather than technology-driven development, committing to the expansion of digital educational resources rather than the digital presentation of textbooks, and aiming at improving teachers and students’ information literacy rather than the applied skills of information technology. The future vision of the plan involves building new models on talent cultivation, education service, and education governance. The new models on talent cultivation involve establishing “Wisdom Teaching” mode, learning mode, and intelligent learning environment supported by artificial intelligence technology. The new education service models entail building the admission and sharing mechanism of quality educational resources based on National Network for Education and the public service platform and system for educational resources by means of the cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The new education governance models involve achieving precise, flat, and humanized education governance. Originality/Value: This article entails expounding the motivation, framework for action, main features, and vision of the education informatization 2.0 in China, which will be helpful for learning and understanding the current background, stage, and future path of China’s education informatization.}

abstract = {The creativity of the brain is usually measured by one’s creative behavior or activity. This study explores connections between an individual’s creative behavior and his or her creative brain by asking each participant to design an open-ended virtual product in an integrated system consisting of virtual reality and brainwaves. The results show a significant correlation between the individual creativity level and the state of flow. There is a significant correlation between the state of flow and the quality of the creative product. The attention value is correlated significantly with the quality of product. The participants’ four different behaviors significantly demonstrated different attention and meditation levels. The sequential analysis shows that people with high product creativity have a higher attention value while maintaining a state of relaxation, demonstrated during the behavior of painting in the virtual reality environment. Given a limited period of time, a higher level of product creativity can be achieved through persistent implementation, concentration, and by being relaxed both physically and mentally. Implications of the study on teaching, learning, and designing a creative learning environment will be discussed.}

This research paper aims to highlight the essence of robotics education in Uzbekistan investigating the perception of parents and children to their full potential and identifying impediments to the process of implementing robotics in Uzbekistan. This research study involves primary and secondary research methods. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the reflection of robotics education among primary and secondary school children. Official statistical data was gathered to prove the scope of demographics. Primary data was collected through the survey among parents whose children attended robotics classes. Ultimately, the authors have used empirical evidence to provide recommendations and solutions on how to implement robotics education effectively in Uzbekistan. Much emphasis has not been put on robotics education in Uzbekistan, despite reforms in the field of STEM education. Moreover, the condition (including teachers, lesson materials, classrooms, computers, and robotics kits) to implement robotics classes as more developed countries are doing has not been created properly, which hampers the introduction of robotics at schools. In addition, the majority of parents are not fully aware of the authentic value of robotics education in children’s lives. Hence, Uzbek schools are lagging in the field of robotics.}

Researchers have indicated the importance of guiding students to make comparisons and reflection during the process of project-based learning. Therefore, the present research proposed a peer assessment-based PBL (PA-PBL) approach to boost students’ PBL performances. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted for 3 weeks. A total of 110 secondary students were divided into an experimental group learning with the PA-PBL approach and a control group learning with the conventional PBL (C-PBL) approach. The students’ problem-solving tendency, learning achievement, and collaboration tendency were evaluated. The experimental results indicated that the PA-PBL approach improved the students’ learning achievement, especially for those students with higher problem-solving tendency. In terms of collaboration tendency, it was found that the PA-PBL approach benefited the lower problem-solving tendency students more than the C-PBL approach, while there was no difference between the higher problem-solving tendency students in the two groups. The experimental results also indicated that the PA-PBL approach could better enhance students’ problem-solving tendencies than the C-PBL approach.}

Based on the premise of front-end analysis, this paper carries out teaching design from the three aspects of pre-class, in-class, and after-class, and implements a blended teaching practice based on Chaoxing. The results show that after adopting this teaching method, students’ overall course grades have increased significantly from 77.79 to 84.99, and the classroom teaching effect has also been enhanced. The reform of this course has been highly recognized by students, promoting the cultivation of undergraduate students’ innovative abilities while also comprehensively enhancing their proactivity and scientific literacy.}

This study investigated the relationship between information literacy and social media competence (SMC) among 1843 university students. This was done in order to increase knowledge of the components that may be important for preparing university students to be information literate citizens in social media environments. Students’ information literacy and SMC were measured by the Student Information Literacy Test and the SMC-CS scale respectively. Correlation and regression analyses were utilized to explore the relationship between university students’ information literacy and their SMC. The results showed that university students’ ability to utilize information technology to solve problems, and their sense of responsible behavior in cyberspace, are the most critical factors in predicting students’ SMC. Based on the findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of enhancing university students’ information literacy and SMC.}

The current study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between implementing project-based collaborative learning using PowerPoint and improving students’ 21st-century skills from the students’ perspectives. It also examines whether there is a significant relationship between students’ attitudes toward learning collaboratively using PowerPoint to improve their 21st-century skills and their major. The participants of the study were 75 female students enrolled in an Educational Technology and Means course at Najran University. The findings revealed that there is a significant and positive relationship between implementing a project-based collaborative learning approach using PowerPoint and improving the students’ 21st-century skills, r (74) = 0.74 and p < 0.05. Additionally, the findings demonstrated that 21st-century skills improved the most through “actively collaborating with others” (M = 4.6, SD = 0.56). Additionally, there was no significant difference in students’ attitudes toward learning collaboratively using PowerPoint to improve their 21st-century skills in terms of human studies or scientific studies majors, t (37) = 1.97 and p > 0.05. The findings demonstrate that more research is required on the role of higher education in developing meaningful technology-based strategies to improve students’ 21st-century skills in learning environments.}

abstract = {Teaching programming and creating games have attracted much attention over the years, mostly the attention of curriculum developers and teachers. This study designed and developed a video game-based intervention, then investigated the effects of this intervention on middle school students’ learning of probability concepts. In the study, the students learned and used Scratch as a game programming tool. Initially, they received hands-on learning activities on how to use Scratch, and then developed video games based on scenarios authored by the researchers. The study collected quantitative as well as qualitative data using two different measurement tools: probability achievement test and student project assessment rubric, respectively. The data revealed that students were able to learn and use Scratch and develop probability-related and probability-based algorithms that generate random results successfully. The effect of Scratch intervention on students’ learning of probability was statistically significant. Findings were discussed in relation to similar studies reported in the literature. Finally, the study raised a set of further research questions in the Conclusion section.}

abstract = {In today’s technology-driven healthcare landscape, AI competencies are essential for medical students. This study assessed AI literacy and online information search (OIS) skills among 336 students from 12 public medical institutions in Sindh, Pakistan. The survey revealed strong AI literacy in areas such as hardware, software, data literacy, content creation, safety, and problem-solving, but students struggled with understanding AI errors. They also demonstrated sufficient behavioral, procedural, and meta-cognitive competencies in online information searching. A significant positive correlation between AI literacy and OIS skills was found, indicating that higher AI literacy improves students’ search abilities. These findings underscore the need to integrate AI-related skills into medical education to better prepare students for the evolving healthcare environment. The study offers insights for AI developers, AI vendors, medical educators, librarians, medical institution administrators, and policymakers on how they can play a significant role in enhancing AI literacy and search competencies in medical education.}

abstract = {Informed by evidence that computing attitudes may be uniquely constructed in informal contexts and that the early teens are a key period for academic decision-making, we investigate lines of practice that connect computing skills, attitudes, and videogames. We compare the relationship between computer skill, computer efficacy, and activities associated with gaming using a data set of 3,868 children in middle school. The time that children spend gaming has very modest association with skill and efficacy. Accounting for the frequency with which children modify games, engage in social gaming activities, and the salience of gamer identity explains the gender gap in computer skill and significantly narrows the gender gap in computer efficacy. We find support for the argument that computer skill and efficacy are dependent on children connecting often isolated social contexts, a socially embedded characteristic of the digital divide.}

Using Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope procedures we found that the number of Black, Hispanic, and Native American students in AP CS exams have increased steadily and significantly over years, yet they are still far from reaching parity. Further, our findings suggest that the racial disparities among top achievers are very wide. The results provide educators and researchers support for identifying and quantifying the racial disparities in advanced academic programs and may inform the development of policies, practices, and programs to reduce racial disparities in pre-college CS education and further.}

The solution to this problem requires a more robust lens than representation or access alone. Specifically, it will require careful consideration of the ecological contexts of Indigenous school age youth, of which more than 70% live in urban communities (National Urban Indian Family Coalition, 2008). This article reports emergent design principles derived from a community-based design research project. These emergent principles focus on the conceptualization and uses of technology in science learning environments designed for urban Indigenous youth. In order to strengthen learning environments for urban Indigenous youth, it is necessary, we argue, that scholars and educators take seriously the ways in which culture mediates relationships with, conceptions of, and innovations in technology and technologically related disciplines. Recognizing these relationships will inform the subsequent implications for learning environments.}

abstract = {Babasaheb Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was a true educationist which is evident through his eruditeness and pursuit of higher education in the early twentieth century. This was a time when receiving an array of degrees from abroad was unheard of by most people. His scholastic endeavors initiated from an early age to build a character and take up Sankalp (resolve) to devote himself to the service of the nation by aiding the poorest of the poor and to socially uplift themselves through education as a means. His contribution to the growth and development of social sciences is often overlooked by scholars and researchers in Indian academia. Nonetheless, his indomitable visions and thoughts seem to influence policymaking even to date which is evident in the drafting of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the following of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These policies were created in the recent past but in essence, these policies intricately follow the values and ideals laid down by Dr. Ambedkar. His vision was not simply constrained to education as a development of personality but education as a means of future livelihood, more specifically as a development multiplier. Education, for Dr. Ambedkar, was a means to break free from the fetters of analphabetism, obliviousness, and the fallacies of so-called elite castes, which would empower and emancipate them to fight various degrees of social discrimination and eventually annihilate them. The present article seeks to delve into the NEP 2020 policy as a pivotal instrument echoing Dr. Ambedkar’s value for fostering an egalitarian society as our nation strives toward being Vishwaguru and becoming Viksit Bharat by 2047, highlighting that, indeed, every voice matters.}

abstract = {The emergence of block-based environments aims to facilitate the problems caused by the abstractness of text-based languages. Recent studies generally focus on the effect of having block-based experience on programming education. This study is an attempt to observe the transfer of previous programming experiences (block-based vs. text-based) into a three-dimensional game-making environment through the use of backwards fading. In addition to observation of transfer, students’ perceptions about the difficulty of practices were also investigated. Twenty-one senior university students participated in the study. They practiced through worked example, completion example, and full practice. Moreover, the comparison of the contribution of three examples, their perceived difficulty, and cognitive load has also been observed. There are four main findings that add value to the current literature. First, students having text-based programming experience had higher scores, which may be a sign of far transfer; second, completion example format was more efficient for students having block-based programming experience; third, full practice format was perceived as more difficult than either worked example or completion example; and fourth, based on the efficiency of example formats, completion example represented high efficiency for all students. However, average efficiency of all example formats has represented high efficiency for students, who had text-based programming experience.}

abstract = {Purpose: We aim to better understand the curricular, staffing, and achievement trade-offs entailed by expansions of high-school computer science (CS) for students, schools, and school leaders. Methods: We use descriptive, correlational, and quasi-experimental methods to analyze statewide longitudinal course-, school-, and staff-level data from California, where CS course taking has expanded rapidly. Findings: We find that these rapid CS course expansions have not come at the expense of CS teachers’ observable qualifications (namely certification, education, or experience). Within-school course taking patterns over time suggest that CS enrollment growth has come at the expense of social studies, English/language arts (ELA), and arts courses, as well as from other miscellaneous electives. However, we find no evidence that increased enrollment of students in CS courses at a school has a significant effect on students’ math or ELA test scores. Implications: Flexible authorization requirements for CS teachers appear to have allowed school leaders to staff new CS courses with teachers whose observable qualifications are strong, though we do not observe teachers’ CS teaching skill. Increasing CS participation is unlikely to noticeably improve school-level student test scores, but administrators also do not need to be overly concerned that test scores will suffer. However, school leaders and policymakers should think carefully about what courses new CS courses will replace and whether such replacements are worthwhile.}

abstract = {The critical research agenda on smart cities has tended to assume a largely top-down orientation in which powerful actors like the state and corporations enact programmes to embed Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) in the urban landscape. Because of the way research has framed this relation of power, the dominant response has been to seek social justice by either contesting these top-down exercises of (digital) power or by reconceptualising the smart city ‘from below’. In this paper, we join a growing chorus of voices recognising the importance of interstitial actors that influence the ways in which the smart city manifests. We draw on a five-year ongoing study in Calgary, Alberta, to examine two actor groups that are, properly, neither top-down nor bottom-up, but play an important role in envisioning, implementing and contesting how ‘smartness’ is framed. The first set of actors, situated between the top and bottom of the smart city hierarchy, are most prominently community associations, non-profit organisations and ad-hoc task groups. The second group is comprised of groups with different digital practices, whose spectre of marginalisation influences how digital systems are articulated and pursued. These actors strategically move between different interstices in order to enact particular kinds of political influence, and often influence smart cities by virtue of their absence, profoundly impacting urban political geographies of smartness.}

abstract = {This article considers the issue of opacity as a problem for socially consequential mechanisms of classification and ranking, such as spam filters, credit card fraud detection, search engines, news trends, market segmentation and advertising, insurance or loan qualification, and credit scoring. These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.}

This article concludes with additional implications arising from considering sensemaking in conjunction with big data analytics as a critical way of understanding unique aspects of learning and technology in the 21st century.}

We find that there are four interrelated categories of resources that influence this fundamentally playful process. Our results indicate that this process of preparation constitutes a core component of the appeal of Warhammer 40,000. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the diverse activities that go into gameplay that often exceed the computer game “client” or board of play. We suggest the category of engagement pastime to encapsulate these extended, ongoing elements of Warhammer 40,000’s appeal, which we define as a collection of interlinked and associated activities that serve to occupy one’s time and thoughts pleasantly.}

This study identified the attitude toward cinema reopening and readiness toward visiting cinema are able to significantly predict all the related factors of cinemagoers’ willingness in the post COVID-19 era.

abstract = {Research on early childhood robotics education often focuses narrowly on teaching young children STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) concepts and skills. In this qualitative case study, our research team examined what happened when we worked with young children (age 7) and combined the technologies of robotics education with an inquiry approach, that is, an opportunity for students to collaboratively identify a problem arising from their own lived experiences and build a robot to solve it. We found that the process of children’s problem identification was dialogic, not only with peers and teachers but also with materials, as they defined and refined problems based on interactions with peers and objects. As this study was conducted at an economically disadvantaged public school in the Southern United States, we argue that early childhood robotics education has a great potential to engage young children in STEM learning in a personally meaningful manner and that an instructional approach fostering children’s inquiry and project-based learning through their problem finding and problem posing is effective in making STEM accessible to students from diverse backgrounds.}

Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), in conjunction with photovoice, facilitated a detailed data analysis, revealing four main clusters of pedagogies viewed as innovative by students: “Hero Pedagogies,” highlighting emotional engagement and storytelling; “Community and Solidarity Pedagogies,” emphasizing community involvement; “Sustainable Green Pedagogies,” focusing on sustainability; and “Technology Enhanced Pedagogies,” which utilize technology to improve learning experiences. Students expressed a strong preference for pedagogical strategies that promote emotional connections and incorporate storytelling, stressing the importance of human interaction in the learning process. They also valued approaches that foster community-centered learning, interdisciplinary methods, and experiential education for tackling broader societal and economic challenges. The role of technology in bridging theory with practical application was also underscored. These findings offer insights into effective pedagogical practices by highlighting student-supported approaches. Integrating these innovative pedagogical clusters can enhance the educational experience for institutions, communities, and learners alike, fostering active engagement in the learning journey.}

By combining a modular computer programming language with a modular building platform, LEGO Education has allowed students (of all ages) to become active leaders in their own education as they build everything from animals for a robotic zoo to robots that play children’s games. Most importantly, it allows all students to develop different solutions to the same problem to provide a learning community. We look first at how the recent developments in the learning sciences can help in promoting student learning in robotics. We then share four case studies of successful college-level implementations that build on these developments.}

abstract = {Critical thinking is routinely identified as a goal for student learning in higher education. Critical thinking, however, is difficult to define or teach, often left as an educational aspiration that is challenging to operationalize and assess. Therefore, many interventions targeting critical thinking are isolated and tend to focus on the development of cognitive skills, providing less attention to students’ dispositions toward applying these skills to different situations. In this study of a redesigned course at a research-intensive university, we query what a dispositional view of thinking can reveal about students’ understanding and experience in an active learning environment. Drawing on student reflection journals and semi-structured interviews with 13 students from two cohorts of the course, we trace how students decide when and how critical thinking is necessary and suitable, as well as when it is perceived to be too demanding or out of place in the classroom. The course included newly introduced, ill-structured problems aimed at competency development. We note that although students employed many critical thinking skills to complete these tasks, the uncertainty related to applying critical thinking to ill-structured problems often conflicted with students’ expectations of classroom instruction. When adapting to unfamiliar instructional practices, students were largely successful in using different approaches to solve problems. However, students’ sensitivity to error and tendency toward familiar ways of being students were barriers to the solidification of critical thinking habits. We argue that to foster long-lasting critical thinking skills and dispositions, education interventions need to shift from the course to the program level and move toward the development of broader cultures of thinking.}

abstract = {Personalisation of media content is not a new phenomenon. Now, however, by configuring our search results and data feeds, algorithms that ‘learn’ from our digital footprint are determining what we see and hear. Pariser calls this the ‘Filter Bubble Effect’. Yet, despite concerns that this effect is a threat to deliberative democracy, we are told there is relatively little evidence to substantiate its existence. This article draws on a case study to argue that this is because the existing research looks for technical effects while neglecting our social lives. If we follow Foucault’s reasoning that systems of thought are also technologies, then we can see that material technologies (or what Foucault called ‘technologies of production’) and immaterial technologies (ideas formed in discourse) can co-constitute filter bubbles. Borrowing language from computing and science and technology studies, this leads to a redefinition of filter bubbles as socio-technical recursion. This case study illustrates just one potential combination of such material and immaterial technologies (namely, search engines and ideas that are encountered and formed during an individual’s social life within their culture and class) that can create socio-technical recursion. The article concludes by arguing the advantage of conceptualising filter bubbles in this way is that it offers us a theoretical foundation for breaking out of this recursion by simultaneously challenging the mediums and messages that sustain them.}

abstract = {Establishing validated science programs for students with or at risk for learning disabilities requires testing treatment effects and exploring differential response patterns. This study explored whether students’ initial mathematics and reading skills influenced their treatment response to a whole-class, second-grade science program called Scientific Explorers (Sci2). The original Sci2 study employed a cluster randomized controlled design and included 294 U.S. students from 18 second-grade classrooms. Differential effects of the program by initial mathematics and reading skill levels were not observed for an interactive science assessment and a distal science outcome measure. However, based on initial reading skill levels, moderation results were found on a science vocabulary measure, suggesting the effects of Sci2 were greatest for students with higher initial reading skills. Similar results were found using initial mathematics skill levels as a predictor of differential response such that students with higher mathematics skills reaped stronger treatment effects on the vocabulary measure. Further, we found initial mathematics skills also influenced outcomes on the proximal science content assessment, where students with higher initial mathematics skills led to higher outcomes. Overall, findings suggest Sci2 produced robust effects for all students (g = 0.24–1.23), regardless of initial skill proficiencies. Implications for exploring differential response in science intervention research are discussed.}

Drawing on a technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework informed by prior research on (language) teacher education and computer-assisted language learning, this study examines how preservice teachers described their knowledge base specifically related to using digital tools equitably with multilingual learners. Qualitative analysis of 17 preservice teachers’ course discussions, assignments, and interviews revealed that preservice teachers purposefully reflected on and selected digital tools to use that would support students’ language development and leverage students’ interests. They also reflected on structural inequities and advocacy related to technological implementation. This study encourages teacher educators to support preservice teachers in developing technologically savvy practices that are also linguistically responsive and humanizing by centering equity in TPACK.}

abstract = {In this article, the authors demonstrate how the data center has become a key site, object, and metaphor for interdisciplinary scholarship of the internet. While the data center is a fabrication of engineering, computer science, and cognate fields, it has been the critical gaze of scholars outside of those industries. Together, this scholarship has established the field of Critical Data Center Studies. Critiques of the data center – often thought of more generally as ‘internet infrastructure’, and more evocatively as ‘the cloud’ – have emerged from the social sciences, humanities, journalism, and the arts. The authors do this by answering questions about the current social, cultural, political, and environmental landscapes of the data center. Scrutiny of the foundational imaginaries of the internet, real estate deals by Big Tech, the industry’s enabling policies, their connections to energy and other public infrastructure – among many other factors – serves, at the very least, to situate the data center as a media object, as more than simply a material infrastructure, as more than data warehouse, and as more than ‘the cloud’. Further to this, the authors reflect on how the data center has been and continues to be studied, and why critical interventions have been so fruitful within a vast array of disciplines – from history and anthropology, to media studies, information studies, and science & technology studies – for shifting the focus from questions of infrastructural visibility to questions that weave together concerns of efficiency, policy, popular culture, and planetary devastation.}

While much scholarship supports gamification, labor sociologists have long problematized the phenomenon. In this mixed-methods action research study, we explore the results of gamifying a lesson on gamification in a sociology of work course. We designed two gamified activities with varying degrees of consent that followed a lesson on gamification and consent. Students rated how problematic a series of gamified work scenarios were before and after the intervention. Our quantitative data did not show a significant increase in students’ ability to identify consent after the intervention, but we did discover that students took either an employee or employer’s perspective in their rating justifications. Furthermore, these findings were gendered. This article highlights the need for a more critical take on gamification in the classroom. We conclude by suggesting ways practitioners can teach about gamification in other contexts.}

abstract = {Computer programming is a difficult course for many students. Prior works advocated for group learning pedagogies in pursuit of higher-level reasoning and conceptual understanding. However, the methodological gaps in existing implementations warrant further research. This study conducted a three-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial to comparatively evaluate the social and cognitive effects of group learning pedagogies in computer programming. Following an apprenticeship model, each group has a designated master: drivers in pair programming (PP), peer leaders in peer-led team learning (PLTL), and practitioners in practitioner-assisted group learning (PAGL). In all course deliverables, the PP group received the lowest mean scores. Meanwhile, no significant difference was found between the PLTL and PAGL groups. Except for psychological safety, social factors such as task cohesion, interdependence, and group potency were significantly different between the groups. Both PLTL and PAGL groups reported a significant increase in social factors after 14 weeks of intervention. These findings provide a rationale for educational leaders and teachers to formulate curricular plans that integrate PLTL and PAGL in computer programming education. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on group learning, expands the pedagogies in computer programming, and serves as additional empirical evidence on cognitive apprenticeship and sociocultural perspectives of learning.}

However, as the technology is still nascent and has yet to reach its full potential, ideas and arguments abound, championing or cautioning against the use of these technologies. Design/Approach/Methods To fill this gap in research on policy networks and AI in British higher education, this article employs network ethnography and discourse analysis to study how ideas about AI-powered technologies in higher education circulate in policy networks in the United Kingdom. Findings The findings evidence a policy network showing signs of a heterarchy permeated by neoliberal rationales and populated by policy actors actively promoting artificial intelligence technologies to be used in education. Originality/Value This paper builds on existing research by looking at the university and not-for-profit sectors, in addition to the governmental and educational technology sectors. Using network ethnography, this article expands our understanding of the policy actors involved and critically analyzes ideas regarding the use of AI in education.}

We show how “structured journalism” gave journalists a language for the social and technical challenges involved, and how this infrastructural technology mediates between fact-checkers, audiences, and platform companies. We argue that this standard-setting initiative exhibits both promotional and disciplining facets, offering greater distribution and impact to journalists while also defining their work in specific ways. Crucially, in this case, this disciplining influence reflects internal professional-institutional agendas in an emerging subfield of journalism as much as the demands of platform companies.}

abstract = {Scientific knowledge, ideally neutral and impartial, is inevitably shaped by geographical, economic, and cultural contexts. This research contends that overcoming the constraints of human and economic scarcity, inertia, and limited funding access demands development of collaborative research networks. To this end, four university laboratories from Brazil and Chile - UFRJ, UBB, UTFSM and UAI - have united to advance robotics applied to architecture. The methodology begins with an analysis of Industry 4.0, Fab Lab implementations, and robotics in architecture in the region. They identify key research aspects by mapping each laboratory’s activities and technologies to pinpoint expertise and potential collaborative areas. The authors propose a summary table comparing the labs and a chronological overview to track regional robotics advancement. To raise awareness among peers, the initiative involves joint actions such as courses, workshops and technical visits.1 Recognising the scarcity of robotic units and the inapplicability of procedures from wealthier contexts, the authors draw on their lab experience to propose guidelines for implementing robotics research units in academia within the region. This includes technological alternatives, installation considerations, and detailed configuration reviews. The deployment of additional robotic units is a means to foster collaboration and bolster the network. Anticipated outcomes encompass increased critical mass, collaborative research initiatives, faculty and student exchange across institutions, higher publication rates, knowledge acquisition, and improved access to global funding agencies. In summary, the Southern Creative Robotics network initiative aims to catalyse the creative integration of digital manufacturing and robotics technology within design in the Ibero-American context.}

abstract = {Journalism education has tended to respond slowly to developments in digital journalism, such as data journalism, despite or because of close links with the industry. This article examines the obstacles to innovation in journalism education with particular reference to data journalism, drawing on the literature, a review of stakeholders and course documents, and the author’s reflections on developing a data journalism module as part of a new MA programme. It highlights the complexities linked to the particular demands of data journalism, and identifies critical issues around student satisfaction; reputation and job/career outcomes; relevance, currency and appeal; programme management; and coherence. Rather than holding it back, more specialized socialization could assist journalism education to innovate effectively, the author suggests.}

abstract = {System knowledge and reasoning mechanisms are essential means for intellectualization of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). As enablers of system intelligence, they make such systems able to solve application problems and to maintain their efficient operation. Normally, system intelligence has a human-created initial part and a system-produced (extending) part, called synthetic system intelligence (SSI). This position paper claims that SSI can be converted to a new industrial asset and utilized as such. Unfortunately, no overall theory of SSI exists and its conceptual framework, management strategy, and computational methodologies are still in a premature stage. This is the main reason why no significant progress has been achieved in this field, contrary to the latent potentials. This paper intends to contribute to: (i) understanding the nature and fundamentals of SSI, (ii) systematizing the elicitation and transfer of SSI, (iii) exploration of analogical approaches to utilization of SSI, and (iv) road-mapping and scenario development for the exploitation of SSI as an industrial asset. First, the state of the art is surveyed and the major findings are presented. Then, four families of analogical approaches to SSI transfer are analyzed. These are: (i) knowledge transfer based on repositories, (ii) transfer among agents, (iii) transfer of learning resources, and (iv) transfer by emerging approaches. A procedural framework is proposed that identifies the generic functionalities needed for a quasi-autonomous handling of SSI as an industrial asset. The last section casts light on some important open issues and necessary follow-up research and development activities.}

abstract = {Digital engineering transformation is a crucial process for the engineering paradigm shifts in the fourth industrial revolution (4IR), and artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical enabling technology in digital engineering transformation. This article discusses the following research questions: What are the fundamental changes in the 4IR? More specifically, what are the fundamental changes in engineering? What is digital engineering? What are the main uncertainties there? What is trustworthy AI? Why is it important today? What are emerging engineering paradigm shifts in the 4IR? What is the relationship between the data-intensive paradigm and digital engineering transformation? What should we do for digitalization? From investigating the pattern of industrial revolutions, this article argues that ubiquitous machine intelligence (uMI) is the defining power brought by the 4IR. Digitalization is a condition to leverage ubiquitous machine intelligence. Digital engineering transformation towards Industry 4.0 has three essential building blocks: digitalization of engineering, leveraging ubiquitous machine intelligence, and building digital trust and security. The engineering design community at large is facing an excellent opportunity to bring the new capabilities of ubiquitous machine intelligence, and trustworthy AI principles, as well as digital trust, together in various engineering systems design to ensure the trustworthiness of systems in Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {In recent years, the government has actively set up computer programming courses to train those with the relevant talent; however, the learning performance of the students is not ideal. Therefore, in order to learn programming skills, students usually adopt note-taking strategies because, due to the pressure of the course, the teachers do not have sufficient time to help the students to fully understand the course content. This means that some students take notes without thinking, so their academic performance is usually poor. This study, therefore, proposes an innovative curriculum design that is based on the “Note-taking System and Teaching Strategy’’ (NSTS), which combines learning style concepts and peer learning concepts to achieve student interaction and promote their thinking skills. In the learning activity, students are asked to search for additional supplementary material and to write their own notes, and then the members of group can read their notes and learn from them. However, the results of the study show that the NSTS curriculum design exhibits significant differences for improving the students’ academic performance, and that it also has a certain influence on their learning motivation.}

Industry 4.0 calls for transformation and effective talent development is vital in ensuring national aspirations are achieved while eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency. As such, this study aims to understand the impact of Industry 4.0 on computer engineering-related workforce and skills development within Multinational Companies (MNCs) to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. In this study, online questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the current and future hiring trends. The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified. Empirical evidence from the analysis contributes to shaping the educational systems of the future and helps to proactively identify specific skills shortages at an early stage.}

For this, we designed the game “Aladdin and his flying carpet” with all pedagogical consideration in mind. We conducted the experiment with 107 sixth grade pupils with no prior knowledge of programing. The game was applied at the beginning of the course in a naturalistic classroom environment. The progress was monitored and evaluated with validated pre- and posttests. The knowledge gain was observed according to the set of learning objectives from the general curricula, and minimum knowledge standards were pursued within those. The result demonstrated that most of the pupils achieved all of the observed learning objectives. The biggest progress was observed with the “complete a program” objective. The least progress was observed with the tasks where “create a program” and “divide a problem” objectives were combined. Strong correlation was found between the final results of the posttest and the scores from playing the game, especially with the more challenging “divide a problem” learning objective. Finally, no significant difference was observed in the results between girls and boys.}

An iterative search strategy was performed to identify PAH authors and then investigate their research productivity over a 5-year period (2017–2022) using the SciVal analytics instrument by Elsevier. Drawing upon the results from multiple bibliometric analyses, the study explores publication productivity specifically in relation to the PAH continuum. This study revealed that distance education, learning, teaching, professional development, and lifelong learning have been the most prominent research areas within the PAH continuum. Within that, related topics were identified, including online learning, mobile learning, e-learning, and educational technology.}

abstract = {Background There have been repeated calls for more widespread use of inquiry-oriented science instruction in K–12 education. At the same time, questions have been raised regarding whether the amount of time in school schedules for science instruction is sufficient to support inquiry-based teaching. This study investigates the relationship between the time available for science instruction and the extent to which eighth-grade science teachers used inquiry-oriented instructional practices in their teaching. Research Questions We consider two research questions: (1) To what extent is teachers’ use of inquiry-oriented instructional practices related to the time available for science instruction during the school week? (2) To what extent do differences in teachers’ professional training to teach science impact the relationship between instructional time and science teachers’ use of inquiry-based instructional practices? Research Design We use data from the 2011 NAEP Grade Eight Science Assessment and multilevel linear modeling to analyze the relationship between instructional time and science teacher practices. Our analyses include approximately 11,520 eighth-grade teachers in 6,850 public schools. Findings The extent to which science teachers used inquiry-oriented instructional practices in their teaching was related to the amount of time available for science instruction. Teachers with 5 or more hours per week were more likely to use inquiry-oriented instructional practices, and the extent to which teachers engaged in reform-oriented science instruction increased with more time for instruction. The relationship between instructional time and teacher practice was largely independent of teacher qualifications, suggesting that instructional time impacts teacher instructional practice regardless of teachers’ educational background, training, or science teaching experience. Conclusions Identifying optimal allocations of instructional time is a relevant consideration in efforts to promote the types of reform-oriented science teaching called for by the National Research Council’s Framework for K–12 Science Education, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and other national and state science assessments. Although investments in teacher training and professional development are also necessary and important investments, with insufficient time, even the most qualified or best trained science teachers may struggle to use inquiry-based instructional approaches.}

Hence foundation and introductory are of as much interest to official statistics as more specialised training. At the same time, greater access to data and vast technological capabilities have seen much emphasis and discussion of the statistical and data sciences and education therein, including development of educational resources in contexts such as civic data and statistics. Data science provides opportunities to renew the decades-long push for authentic learning that reflects the practice of ‘greater statistics’ and ‘greater data science’, and to examine progress to date in implementing and sustaining the extensive work and advocacy of many.

This article analyses educational technology policy in Ireland from 1997 to 2017 and draws attention to an underlying economic agenda for technology integration in schools, set against a backdrop of neoliberal discourses. The study found that the challenge of integrating technology is no longer understood as simply a challenge of “integration” but rather as a realignment of the existing education system toward a more student-centered experience. Most recent policy also recognizes the complex and contextually bound nature of the associated change process suggesting a maturation of understanding in respect of the intersection between technology and education. The article also highlights the symbolic function of policy and the role it plays in representing the educational system in a particular light to national and international audiences. Recognizing the symbolic function of educational technology policy and the neoliberal ideology underpinning it can help identify the reasons for the apparent failures of past attempts to integrate technology in schools as well as informing future policy iterations.}

To address this, a cross-case analysis was conducted. It included six middle school students, each with LD, from a Midwestern city. Each student was enrolled in a general education science class that used inquiry-based instruction. Data sources included student and educator interviews, classroom observations, and student portfolios. Results indicated that most of the students with LD had difficulty acquiring science process knowledge and that students relied on peer supports to facilitate their learning. Findings extend the research on science instruction for students with LD in middle school classrooms using inquiry-based instruction.}

Using an intersectional nepantla lens, we propose that CS education be accessible to all SPE teachers and students with dis/abilities. We argue for a focus on social-emotional intersectional rights as crucial foundations for an equitable approach to teaching and learning in CS SPE. We end with implications for educational stakeholders and teacher education programs that open pathways for socioemotional and intersectional rights of underrepresented teachers and students of CS and SPE.}

abstract = {Digital technologies are rapidly transforming economies and societies. Scholars have approached this rise of digital capitalism from various angles. However, relatively little attention has been paid to digital capitalism’s cultural underpinnings and the beliefs of those who develop most digital technologies. In this paper, we argue that a solutionist order of worth – in which value derives from solving social problems through technology – has become central to an emerging spirit of digital capitalism. We use supervised learning to trace the relative importance of different orders of worth in three novel text corpora. We find that solutionism is indeed central to the normative beliefs of digital elites and the broader digital milieu, but not to capitalist discourse at large. We illustrate the importance of these findings by discussing how the spirit of digital capitalism motivates, legitimates, and orients the actions of digital capitalists.}

abstract = {Background The use of game-based learning strategies in higher education has shown promise to increase student motivation and achievement. Although studies have begun to explore the structuring of courses as a game, little is known on who benefits the most from this type of instructional environment. Aim This research study explored the impact of a large lecture course designed with game-based learning on participation and achievement. Game elements included narrative, quests, points, feedback, and badges. Method 71 undergraduate students participated in a case study utilizing a mixed methods approach. Measures included course achievement, course participation, and a survey on beliefs and practices. Results Findings indicated students in a large course structured with game-based learning maintained high participation and persistence in meeting course requirements. In addition, overall achievement was not significantly correlated with age, gender, learning style, or game use, contradicting the research literature on game-based learning. Conclusions The use of game-based learning is beneficial for engaging all students in large lecture courses, but more work is needed in determining which strategies are most effective for learning.}

With the advent of computers, many of these methodologies were developed in research centres in the USA and the UK. Focussing on this period, this paper investigates the importance of the German Hochschule fur Gestaltung, Ulm (HfG) design school in the early stages of computation in design and architecture. Even though there were no computers in the school, it may be argued that its innovative pedagogy and distinguished faculty members launched analogical computational design methods that can be seen as the basis for further computational approaches in architecture. The paper draws on archive material, as well as at an original interview with Tomas Maldonado, to propose that the remarkable work pursued by Tomas Maldonado (the educational project), Max Bense (information aesthetics) and Horst Rittel (scientific methods) was fundamental in establishing HfG Ulm as the forerunner of computation in architecture.}

abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers faced challenges conducting data collection. However, emerging communication technologies, such as web-conferencing platforms, provided an alternative mode of data collection. Among these platforms, Zoom stands out for its functional affordances and unique features that support data collection methods, including screen-capturing, digital photography, drawing, polling, and artifact-based interviews, which attempt to reveal a child’s viewpoint and ability. In this article, we explore the feasibility of using Zoom to conduct educational research by investigating the mathematical learning experience among 26 primary 1 and 2 students in Hong Kong on two topics—understanding time and addition and subtraction. Five mathematics teachers were recruited to participate in 2-month online workshops with assessments among three groups of students to understand the suitability for data collection. Based on teachers’ observations and students’ responses, our findings suggest that Zoom is a viable and effective tool for qualitative data collection. It offers a cost-effective method for researchers and educators to examine students’ mathematical performance in an online environment. We also investigate students’ perceptions of online assessment strategies, perceived usefulness of various Zoom functions, and explore the benefits and challenges teachers and students perceived throughout mathematical education using Zoom. However, several technical difficulties were encountered, such as the digital literacy gap and privacy concerns. Therefore, improving students’ digital literacy for remote learning and triangulation is important for online mathematical data collection and assessments.}

Experts in computer science education have expressed the importance of establishing clear expectations for who should be able to teach CS. To enhance the quality of computer science teachers, clear and consistent preparation and certification pathways are needed for teachers to implement computer science education. This study extends on prior work by creating a consistent framework of definitions for talking about and comparing CS teacher qualification pathways policies across states. We summarized the current landscape of the CS teacher pathways for all 50 states as of 2020. Nineteen states had an initial certification program, 42 states had an add-on license, and 24 states had an authorization pathway. There were five states that did not have any computer science teacher qualification pathways policy: Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Oregon. We discuss the policy implications and recommendations for future research around CS teacher qualification pathways.}

We categorized research method course content in 52 syllabi from 31 MPA programs to understand how data skills are taught in public administration.

Fast-paced automation, the importance of cosmopolitanism and the colonial legacy have come to dominate educational discourse and drive calls for streamlined educative practice. Although such efficiency models empower a transactional/linear mode of teaching and learning, they do little to privilege integrative voices, deliberation and intersubjective care found in global citizenship education (GCE) definitions. We argue such rationality has exacerbated a neo-colonial ethic that promulgates economic, political and cultural pressure to control and narrow otherwise diverse learning opportunities. Drawing from recent research into technology and GCE in two International Baccalaureate international schools, we note the importance of communicative outreach and agency in diversity. We also highlight the distorting effects of hyper-rationalised neo-colonial interpretations of global agency. This article will interest those seeking to develop global educational policy and practice along with revitalising interpretations of technology integration.}

abstract = {What is algorithmic thought? It is not possible to address this question without first reflecting on how the Universal Turing Machine transformed symbolic logic and brought to a halt the universality of mathematical formalism and the biocentric speciation of thought. The article draws on Sylvia Wynter’s discussion of the sociogenic principle to argue that both neurocognitive and formal models of automated cognition constitute the epistemological explanations of the origin of the human and of human sapience. Wynter’s argument will be related to Gilbert Simondon’s reflections on ‘technical mentality’ to consider how socio-techno-genic assemblages can challenge the biocentricism and the formalism of modern epistemology. This article turns to ludic logic as one possible example of techno-semiotic languages as a speculative overturning of sociogenic programming. Algorithmic rules become technique-signs coinciding not with classic formalism but with interactive localities without re-originating the universality of colonial and patriarchal cosmogony.}

abstract = {Information technology and computer science represent one area of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) that have experienced significant growth in recent years. As such, federal policy has urged schools to embed new types of STEM courses into the curriculum. As one very prominent example, computer science (CS)-focused courses are a growing branch of career and technical education (CTE)—that is, CS-CTE. While previous research has examined coursetaking patterns and subsequent outcomes of CS-CTE courses for the general student population, little is known about how participation in these courses may benefit students with learning disabilities (SWLDs). From a pedagogical perspective, CS-CTE courses, and CTE courses in general, may be uniquely positioned to improve schooling outcomes for SWLDs. Using data from the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we explored characteristics of CS-CTE participants, how CS-CTE may promote the development of key STEM attitudes (e.g., identity, self-efficacy, and utility), and how any relationships may differ by learning disability status. Using a double propensity score matching estimations, we found CS-CTE participation related to positive development of STEM identity and STEM self-efficacy for students without learning disabilities. For the SWLD population, CS-CTE participation was associated with growth in STEM self-efficacy and STEM utility. Policy implications discuss the gap in computer science employment between SWLDs and non-SWLDs, the prevalence of state-related computer science policies, and how to continue to promote STEM identity growth.}

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the computational experiment approach, learning styles, epistemic beliefs, and engagement with the inquiry process on the learning performance of pre-service engineering students. The study used the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM), in order to provide information for the relation of FSLSM with the learning environment in order to examine whether the strength of learning styles has an effect on the students’ learning performance in mismatched courses. Our objective was: a) to investigate whether students with a strong preference for a specific learning style have more difficulties in learning, if their learning style is not supported in the learning environment; b) if the methodology of the computational experiment has an impact on students independently of their learning style; and c) if the epistemological beliefs are related to different learning styles. The learning environment was based on the methodology of the computational experiment and applications were developed using the Easy Java Simulator software, while the inquiry based teaching and learning process was adopted. The questionnaire responses were gathered from 79 pre-service engineering students in a higher education institute in Greece. Results indicate that students with no preferred learning style have a better learning performance in mismatched courses.}

Yet there exists no definition or measure of what people do to learn technologies that are new to them and empirically link this to inequality. To address this gap, I conducted studies involving over 2,000 adolescents to develop and validate a measure of what I call “digital adaptability,” the use of five habits that help individuals learn technologies that are new to them. The studies included observation and cognitive interviews to describe adaptability and develop an initial item pool, a pilot to narrow items using structural equation modeling, a full test with 897 eighth-grade students in Chicago with analysis of convergent and discriminant validity, and a replication study with 1,285 high school students near Boston. Finally, using Chicago and Boston area data, I find adaptability correlates with students’ educational plans and career aspirations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics —linking digital adaptability to students’ futures. Overall, the digital adaptability measure provides a critical theoretical and empirical tool for digital inequality research, practice, and policy.}

Digital tools, such as automated assessment systems, can be useful and supportive in teaching CS courses. This two-stage design-based research (DBR) study investigated the effects of targeted feedback in an automated assessment system for addressing common misconceptions of high school students in a Java-based introductory programming course. Based on students’ common errors and underlying misconceptions, targeted feedback messages were designed and provided for students. The quantitative analysis found that with targeted feedback students were more likely to correct the errors in their code. The qualitative analysis of students’ solutions revealed that when improving the code, students receiving feedback made fewer intermediate incorrect solutions. In other words, the targeted feedback messages may help to promote conceptual change and facilitate learning. Although the findings of this exploratory study showed evidence of the power of digital tools, more research is needed to make technology benefit more CS teachers.}

abstract = {Narratives on innovation in education are spreading fast and both national and local educational administrations have been recently promoting innovation policies and programmes in many different European contexts. Academic literature analysing the potential benefits of innovation in education has expanded accordingly, with some international organizations increasingly commissioning research aiming to study the impacts of educational innovation, especially on learning outcomes. Interestingly, less attention has been given to analysing how these policies and programmes are translated into different practices at the school level. Drawing on a policy enactment framework, this paper aims to analyse the ways in which schools interpret top-down policy text and prescription on innovation and enact innovation in education. To do so, we focus on the case of Xarxes per al Canvi (XC), an educational innovation programme launched by the educational administration of the city of Barcelona in 2017 that aims to create school networks in order to stimulate knowledge sharing and innovation. Findings show how schools make sense of the innovation policy diversely. Policy enactment outcomes appear to be context-sensitive, with schools enacting its precepts in different ways, especially to serve their needs in increasingly competitive local education markets.}

After citing concerns expressed by psychologists and others regarding computationalism, the paper considers four entailments of the compost heap analogy that may serve, very roughly, as counterparts to such concepts as encoding, storage, and retrieval. They are: laying it on, breaking it down, stirring it up, and mixing it in. The paper concludes with reflections on the advantages of a more organic model of memory and some suggestions for further inquiry concerning issues of interest to the psychology of aging.}

Second, I discuss the logic of domains in contemporary computer, information, and data science circles. While STS is often agnostic about the borders between the sciences or with industry and state—occasionally taking those boundaries as an object of study—data science takes those boundaries as its target to overcome. These two elective affinities present analytic and practical challenges for STS but also opportunities for engagement. Overall, in addition to these typifications, I urge STS scholars to strategically position themselves to investigate and contribute to the breadth of transformations that seek to touch virtually every science and newly bind spheres of academy, industry, and state.}

abstract = {It is well known that, despite his close engagement with cinema, Gilles Deleuze was less concerned with animated film, being somewhat dismissive of its capabilities. In recent years, however, a number of attempts have been made – most notably by William Schaffer, Thomas Lamarre and Dan Torre – to construct Deleuzian positions in animation theory. This article outlines some of these approaches, whilst engaging critically with Torre’s writings. In particular, it foregrounds Torre’s neglect of the post-structural, political dimension of Deleuzian thought through an examination of the concepts of faciality, the close-up, and relation as they occur in Deleuzian and Deleuzo-Guattarian philosophy. This is in part facilitated through a comparison of Stuart Blackton’s Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906) – a work directly addressed by Torre, and Emile Cohl’s Fantasmagorie (1908) – a work which he largely passes by. It is claimed here that, despite a number of apparent similarities, the animations of Cohl and Blackton express a radically divergent series of ontological commitments. Cohl offers the audience an experience of chaotic, mutable, relational complexity that revels in its incoherence, whilst Blackton presents a series of more straightforward set pieces, dwelling for the most part upon object-centric representational form. The tension between representation and becoming that occurs between these works is employed to facilitate a critical engagement with Torre’s process-cognitivism. It is suggested that Torre’s work, though exceptional in its pedagogic value, is likewise expressive of this tension, and that in its effort firstly to combine a series of process-philosophical and cognitivist ideas, and secondly to unpack the radical ideas of Deleuze through the more conservative philosophy of Nicholas Rescher, it runs the risk of falling back into a quasi-Kantian philosophy of generality and representation.}

abstract = {Piaget’s (1953, 1955) increasingly controversial claim that infant knowledge depends upon action need not be rejected, provided the mechanisms underlying infant ability are conceptualized appropriately in computational terms. Computational concepts solve many problems caused by Piaget’s notions of perception, behaviour, schemes, reciprocal-assimilation and action. Artificial intelligence work on vision offers a way of explaining early perceptual abilities that is precise, internally coherent and able to encompass recent findings of innate organization. Concepts from the procedural programming languages offer a way of accounting for both internal and overt aspects of behaviour, and for the functional coordination of perception and behaviour that characterizes infant anion. This perspective challenges Piaget’s view that development necessitates a radical reconstruction of action-based knowledge. Conceptualized computationally, perceptual-behavioural action can be seen to involve representation in a nontrivial sense. Restructuring of action mechanisms can account for some central phenomena of infant development.}

The selection of papers for this study was done through systematic literature review techniques. The 11 themes were generated through the thematic analysis of the papers that is, STEM education and its awareness; its challenges, issues, and problems; its curriculum; inquiry and learning environment; technologies; learning and models of integration; a blended learning approach; students’ problem-solving abilities and skills; its implementation and evaluation; it’s research and current trends; and interdisciplinary collaboration and intervention. Policy and planning, infrastructure, and the state of society were found the main factors of the poor conditions of STEM education. STEM research studies suggest that a curriculum with a blended learning approach has to be integrated by interventions of models depicting technological and inquiry-based environments to bring awareness among teachers, which strengthens the students’ problem-solving abilities and skills.}

abstract = {Whole number computations are a critical skill that serves as a foundation upon which higher-order concepts in mathematics are taught to children. To facilitate their instruction, educators often use multiple representations to support a child’s cognition. Representations with physical manipulatives are widely studied through a graduated instructional sequence featuring concrete, representational, and abstract stages of learning. In contrast, research on representational sequences featuring virtual manipulatives is less robust. Thus, this study evaluated an instructional strategy with virtual manipulatives, static representational drawings, and abstract algorithms to teach multiplication to three U.S. elementary students with mathematics difficulty. A functional relation was established via a single-subject multiple probe design between the treatment and students’ accuracy performance. Baseline-corrected Tau estimates confirmed a medium effect size for all three students, while student performance on measures assessing the number of errors committed and the duration of sessions also returned favorable findings.}

abstract = {In 2015, the World Economic Forum announced that the world was on the threshold of a ‘fourth industrial revolution’ driven by a fusion of cutting-edge technologies with unprecedented disruptive power. The next year, in 2016, the fourth industrial revolution appeared as the theme of the Forum’s annual meeting, and as the topic of a book by its founder and executive chairman, Klaus Schwab. Ever since, the Forum has made this impending revolution its top priority, maintaining that it will inevitably change everything we once know about the world and how to live in it, thus creating what I conceptualize as ‘future essentialism’. Within a short space of time, the vision of the fourth industrial revolution was institutionalized and publicly performed in various national settings around the world as a sociotechnical imaginary of a promising and desirable future soon to come. Through readings of original material published by the Forum, and through a case study of the reception of the fourth industrial revolution in Denmark, this article highlights and analyses three discursive strategies – ‘dialectics of pessimism and optimism’, ‘epochalism’ and ‘inevitability’ – in the transformation of a corporate, highly elitist vision of the future into policymaking and public reason on a national level.}

abstract = {This article investigates the motivations of African American and Latino girls (N = 41) who navigate urban Southwest school districts during the day, but voluntarily attend a 2-year, culturally responsive multimedia program after school and into the summer. Understanding that girls from economically disadvantaged settings are indeed motivated to become technological innovators but often do not have access to the necessary resources to follow their interest, our program—entitled COMPUGIRLS—assumes a culturally responsive computing approach. This research examines particular features of the program (e.g., asset building, reflections, and connectedness) that attracted and retained the Latina (74%) and African American (19%) adolescent (ages 13-18) participants as well as to what extent the culturally relevant aspects of the curriculum assist with program retention and/or affect the students’ vision of themselves as a future technologist. An evaluative approach gathered 2 years of data from the participants. Field notes from observations and interviews were transcribed and reviewed to extract themes and areas of convergence. As a standpoint theory project, the authors center the girls’ voices as the primary data sources. Two primary themes emerged from the data to explain girls’ sustained motivation. The first was the challenge of learning and mastering the technology. For many, this also included disproving the stereotypes of their abilities by age, gender, and race. The second theme was being able to manipulate technology and learning experiences as a means of self-expression and research, particularly if the results could be used to inform their community and peers. The authors posit that much of the program impact was because of the culturally responsive practices (asset building, reflection, and connectedness) embedded within the curriculum. Implications for urban educators and program developers are considered.}

We take animation to incorporate the methods for representing space, movement, and affect; the social-material environment which animates the people and things we study; and the lively, energetic talk-in-interaction that takes place as people and things move. Our first case uses interaction geography to animate what we call gestural energies and choreographies between a teacher, students, and materials in a bilingual kindergarten classroom activity. Our second case uses interaction geography to animate a young child’s excitement for learning and teaching through movement in a cultural heritage museum. Together, our analysis demonstrates how interaction geography provides alternative ways to conceptualize the multimodal nature of literacy practices and contributes to a recent turn to affect in literacy research. We discuss how this work has implications not only for literacy researchers, teachers, and teacher educators, but also for architects, administrators, and researchers concerned with the physical design of literacy spaces.}

Findings suggest that participation in RET shape science teacher practice and beliefs, which in turn influence practice. Essential features of RET include engaging teachers socially in the research context and in research projects that are personally relevant to them. The model suggests ways to maximize the professional development potential of RET intended to support engagement in disciplinary practices.}

A total of 16 Norwegian j-students are interviewed and 30 internship reports analysed in order to detect the different actors – both humans and non-humans – that matter when students learn through practice in such newsrooms. Through this analysis, this article aims at understanding some of the tensions between legacy and digital culture that many newsrooms today are marked by and how these tensions affect professional knowledge creations for the journalists of tomorrow. The study is framed by sociomaterial perspectives on learning and journalistic practice and argues that two types of materiality are especially important for j-students’ professional knowledge creation during periods of internship: the structure and layout of the newsroom and the software applications in use at the newsroom.}

abstract = {Recognizing individual needs and customer preferences is key to succeeding and increasing competitiveness in both the commercial and public sectors. In the public sector, this is one of the ways to increase the efficiency of public funds allocated to public libraries. However, in order to make the right decisions, library management needs quality information about preferences and consumer behaviour, even from customers who cannot be the subject of routine research due to their young age. Therefore, this article proposes a new methodology for surveying children in order to design library services. The proposed methodology, which integrates principles from ethnographic and sociological methods, aims to overcome the problems of conventional sociological methods, such as how to conceive a child as a respondent and how to determine their preferences from hypothetical situations. This article uses a specially designed questionnaire tool to identify preferences, behaviour and information from children (as visitors of a library). The authors learned that Czech children went to the library primarily for books and games. In addition, the data from the questionnaire revealed patterns in the children’s and adults’ behaviour when visiting the library. All of the data in this article can be used for further research into consumer behaviour.}

We document the role of the selected information and communication technology’s materiality in terms of portability and connectivity along this translation path. Our findings point to the importance of considering national discourse, often overlooked in information and communication technology in education studies, when examining initiative success and failure, and of conceptualizing materiality as more than merely the infrastructural foundation upon which information and communication technology in education initiatives are built. Understanding the role that materiality plays in interaction with national discourse may be especially important in guiding successful information and communication technology in education initiatives in developing countries, where financial resources are limited.}

Different instructional methods have been designed and implemented to stimulate children’s creative thinking skills through their coursework. This study investigated whether scaffolding construction with mind mapping promoted children’s creative thinking in a Scratch course. Two groups of 84 fifth-grade pupils participated in the study. The experimental group of 44 students adopted the scaffolding construction with mind mapping in the Scratch course, while the control group of 40 students did not use the mind mapping method. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Figural (TTCT-F) and Torrance Creative Personality Self-Report Scale were used three times over the 16-week learning period. The results show that learning in the Scratch course promoted the children’s creative thinking. The difference between the two groups indicates that mind mapping was beneficial to improve the children’s creative thinking.}

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalisation efforts in many countries as they try to contain the virus. With the physical handling of cash posing as a potential virus transmission risk, digital payments have become important in the urgent transition to a cashless society and a key feature of smart city projects. Critical analyses have typically framed smart cities as neoliberalist developmental projects that see the partnering of the state with private corporations. However, it is unclear how the smart city emerges under the technocratic inclinations of the developmental state. Focusing on the digital payments project under Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, this paper unpacks the discursive practices employed in mobilising citizen support for electronic payments through a critical analysis of publicly available government materials and recent initiatives. The discourse surrounding digital payments is bound up in narratives surrounding economic competitiveness, technological progress and public health and safety, and strongly rooted in a technocratic governance ethos that limits genuine citizen participation in shaping smart payments technologies. This paper argues that such discursive framings represent a missed opportunity to build a smart city that is truly citizen-centric. This reorientation requires more bottom-up and grassroots-based modes of governance that reformulate smart citizenship into one that pays greater attention to the affective and social contexts behind digital technologies.}

Fuzzy logic was used to model the human reasoning process in linguistic terms. Specifically, fuzzy logic was used to build relationships between skill level concepts as inputs and learning achievement as an output. Gagné learning hierarchy was used to develop a learning hierarchy diagram, which included learning paths and test questions for assessing mathematics skills. First, the Gagné learning hierarchy was used to generate learning path diagrams and test questions. In the second step, skill level concepts were grouped, and their membership functions were established to fuzzify the input parameters and to build membership functions of learning achievement as an output. Third, the inference engine generated fuzzy values by applying fuzzy rules based on fuzzy reasoning. Finally, the defuzzifier converted fuzzy values to crisp output values for learning achievement. Practical applications of the FL-GLH confirmed its effectiveness for evaluating student learning achievement, for finding student learning barrier points, and for providing teachers with guidelines for improving learning efficiency in students.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to automate or assist instructional design, but carry significant open questions, including bias, lack of context sensitivity, privacy issues, and limited evidence. This study investigates ChatGPT as a tool for selecting board games for educational purposes, testing its reliability, accuracy, and context-sensitivity through comparison with human experts evaluation. Results show high internal consistency, whereas correlation analyses reveal moderate to high agreement with expert ratings. Contextual factors are shown to influence rankings, emphasizing the need to better understand both bGBL expert decision-making processes and AI limitations. This research provides a novel approach to bGBL, provides empirical evidence of the benefits of integrating AI into instructional design, and highlights current challenges and limitations in both AI and bGBL theory, paving the way for more effective and personalized educational experiences.}

Game-based learning invokes motivation and engagement in students resulting in effective instructional outcomes. An essential aspect of a serious game is the method of support for presenting the teaching material and providing feedback. A support design that evaluates students’ progress and adapts accordingly, has the potential of producing better learning results. This paper presents an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic that adjusts the support acquisition according to student knowledge level. A serious game for teaching the concepts of sequence and iteration in programming to novice students was built to assess the model. It employs working examples as a support method since previous research indicated that it produced less cognitive load during problem-solving. An empirical study with 102 students has been conducted to evaluate the learning efficiency of the model. The analysis indicates positive results and a potential solution for balancing the amount of assistance in serious games.}

abstract = {Becoming proficient in scientific discourse such as argumentation or developing explanations can be challenging for students, including neurodivergent students (e.g., autistic students, students with learning disabilities, students with ADHD). Students need to practice developing arguments and explanations as well as sharing their conclusions with others; however, these opportunities do not regularly occur. The use of multimedia technology shows promise in being an engaging and effective way to support student learning and discussion of science topics and phenomena. This study investigated the use of a multimedia presentation called Dialogic Instruction for Argumentative Learning in Science (DIALS) in supporting upper-elementary neurodivergent students to provide complete responses to science questions. DIALS provides a structured inquiry investigation to the student in which they learn about a phenomenon through completing scaffolded animated experiments, explicitly learning how to develop an argument and respond to others conclusions, and learning relevant content information to support their argument and explanation development. An adapted alternating treatments design approach was used in this study. The phenomena explored were counterbalanced between three options: DIALS, PowerPoint comparison lessons, or control probe slides. Results from this study show promise in the use of DIALS in enhancing student complete responding to questions and providing quality claims for why they think phenomena occur. Implications for the findings are discussed.}

abstract = {Although schools are recognised as relevant actors in addressing the lack of skills of citizens for participating in Open Data ecosystems, educational approaches have not been clearly defined. In this paper, a design-based research methodological framework has been used to iteratively develop a learning design grounded in data literacy and real-world problem-solving to build Open Data competencies in elementary school. We conducted three cycles including five interventions in Danish schools with 117 pupils and nine teachers in 7th to 9th-grade. The first exploratory cycle provided contextual insights. The second cycle focused on designing an authentic game. The third cycle focused on supporting the Open Data competencies. We have iteratively developed The Open Data Newsroom, a role-playing game that immerses students in a data journalism process to solve a local environmental mystery with data. The results show how central design elements such as an authentic Open Data practice, local open data, physical and digital elements, and real-world complex problems support the development of Open Data skills, keeping students engaged, and creating an authentic experience in Open Data learning designs. The discussion section elaborates on how game-based and authentic learning approaches are central for integrating Open Data in elementary school education.}

abstract = {With growing concerns over children’s data agencies, researchers have begun to draw attention to children’s and young people’s privacy practices in social media environments. However, little is known about the experiences of pre-service teachers who play a key role in educating future generations. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring Finnish pre-service teachers’ conceptions and experiences of data agency in social media environments. Drawing from in-depth interviews of pre-service teachers (N = 14), the analysis revealed that pre-service teachers construct their data agency in terms of social frames and shared social norms, and they also recognize the lack of understanding regarding wider socio-technical systems within which data agencies are situated. This research argues that without a sophisticated understanding of algorithmic governance and commercial use of data, it is unlikely that these future teachers would be prepared to facilitate children’s and youth’s agentive actions in a data-driven society.}

abstract = {Given the strong influence of teachers educators’ pedagogical modeling on new teachers’ capacity to use technology to support student learning, this study sought to answer two interrelated questions: (a) How are teacher educators and teacher education programs currently working to prepare teachers to integrate technology? and (b) How are teacher educators implementing the TPACK (complex integration of technological [T], pedagogical [P], and content [C] knowledge [K]) model? The evidence to answer these questions was derived from an analysis of quantitative and qualitative survey responses from 843 teacher educators from approximately half (n = 541) of the accredited teacher education programs in the country. The results showed that teacher educators are increasingly integrating technology across the curriculum, that there is a fairly low level of TPACK adoption, and that conceptions of TPACK vary greatly. The study helps to better understand these teacher educator practices in relationship to the literature on preparing teachers to use technology to support student learning.}

abstract = {The ball mill is usually the largest energy consumer at a mine site and significantly affects operational expenditures. Given a target particle size, Bond Mill Work Index estimates are used to predict a ball mill’s throughput. In order to maximize ball mill throughput and optimize energy utilization, it is important to get these estimates right. At the Tropicana Gold Mine, Work Index estimates, derived from X-Ray Fluorescence and Hyperspectral scanning of Grade Control samples, are used to construct spatial GeoMetallurgical models (GeoMet). Inaccuracies in block estimates exist due to limited calibration between grade control derived and laboratory Work Index values. To improve the calibration, an updating algorithm has been tested at the Tropicana Gold Mine. The aim of the study was to demonstrate a new process for updating block estimates using actual mill performance data. Deviations between predicted and actual mill performance are monitored and used to locally improve the Work Index estimates in the GeoMet model. The updating algorithm improves the spatial Work Index estimates, resulting in a real-time reconciliation of already extracted blocks and a recalibration of future scheduled blocks. The case study shows that historic and future production estimates improve on average by about 72 and 26%.}

abstract = {Cultivating the digital literacy of all citizens, especially for college students, would contribute to the construction of a ‘Learning Society’ where everybody loves learning and would offer a powerful impetus for building a modern country. First, this paper reviews the origins and general definitions of computer literacy, network literacy, media literacy, information literacy and digital literacy. Compared with similar terminologies, digital literacy features the subjective initiatives to actively improve one’s and others’ skills, competence, awareness and thinking mode for adapting to, qualifying for and creating a new digital age and society. Second, the internal logic in the Digital Literacy Framework of College Students (DLFCS) can be summarized as ‘Skills-Competencies-Awareness’ attributing to the evolution progress of ‘digital technologies utilization, actual problems solving, and digital awareness cultivation’. Following this logic, this paper develops the DLFCS through scene-based requirements analysis and professional consultations, including three areas (i.e. operational skills, applied competencies, thinking & awareness), identifying fifteen descriptors and their examples with key performances. Third, it measures the self-perception and actual performance of college students digital literacy by questionnaire, Q&A tests and task evaluation, and validates the completeness and validity of the DLFCS by Pearson correlation analysis of datasets collected in three modes. The results indicate that (a) the fifteen descriptors in DLFCS basically cover the essential areas of digital literacy with extremely weak correlations among them, (b) the relationships of progressive and intertwined ‘Skills-Competencies-Awareness’ demonstrate the validity of the internal logic and DLFCS itself, (c) to be digitally literate requires long-term and gradually-progressed cultivation and improvement, as achieving one descriptor of digital literacy proficiently does not guarantee good performance on the other descriptors.}

The purpose of the module is to pull together many of the mathematical concepts in the early education of mechanical engineering students while at the same time introducing them to other important topics – an application of finite differences to the numerical approximation of partial differential equations, the importance of controlling round-off error in computational algorithms, and the time complexity of some numerical models. Students learn these topics through the execution of computer experiments. The first set of experiments cover the numerical approximation of heat conduction in a ring, and a second set cover the numerical approximation of the reaction and diffusion of chemicals that will produce the markings on an animal’s tail. The learning outcomes of the module are evaluated with data from pre- and post-module surveys given to mechanical engineering students in several sections of a required course in numerical methods.}

abstract = {The study investigates the potential of anxiety clusters in predicting programming performance in two distinct coding environments. Participants comprised 83 second-year programming students who were randomly assigned to either a block-based or a text-based group. Anxiety-induced behaviors were assessed using physiological measures (Apple Watch and Electrocardiogram machine), behavioral observation, and self-report. Utilizing the Hidden Markov Model and Optimal Matching algorithm, we found three representative clusters in each group. In the block-based group, clusters were designated as follows: “stay calm” (students allocating more of their time to a calm state), “stay hesitant” (students allocating more of their time to a hesitant state), and “to-calm” (those allocating minimal time to a hesitant and anxious state but displaying a pronounced propensity to transition to a calm state). In contrast, clusters in the text-based group were labeled as: “to-hesitant” (exhibiting a higher propensity to transition to a hesitant state), “stay hesitant” (allocating significant time to a hesitant state), and “stay anxious” (remaining persistently anxious in a majority of the coding time). Additionally, our results indicate that novice programmers are more likely to experience anxiety during text-based coding. We discussed the findings and highlighted the policy implications of the study.}

Rules are the mechanism most often used to enable user customization of the environment. However, the expressiveness of the rules available to users in editing and other tools is usually either limited or the available rule editing interfaces are not designed for end-users with low skills in programming. This means we have to look for interaction techniques and new ways to define user customization rules. This paper describes a generic and flexible meta-model to support expressive rules enhanced with data flow expressions that will graphically support the definition of rules without writing code. An empirical study was conducted on the ease of understanding of the visual data flow expressions, which are the key elements in our rule proposal. The visual dataflow language was compared to its corresponding textual version in terms of comprehension and ease of learning by teenagers in exercises involving calculations, modifications, writing and detecting equivalences in expressions in both languages. Although the subjects had some previous experience in editing mathematical expressions on spreadsheets, the study found their performance with visual dataflows to be significantly better in calculation and modification exercises. This makes our dataflow approach a promising mechanism for expressing user-customized reactive behavior in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments. The performance of the rule matching processor was validated by means of two stress tests to ensure that the meta-model approach adopted would be able to scale up with the number of types and instances in the space.}

The two primary goals of this study were to (a) examine the factor structure of a parent-report measure of home science interactions and (b) evaluate how these factors relate to the science core knowledge of young children from families with low incomes. A total of 125 families with children aged 3 to 5 years (52 girls) participated in the study. Children were assessed on a measure of science core knowledge, and parents completed a brief questionnaire on their home science interactions that included questions pertaining to both home science disciplinary core idea (DCI) engagement and home science and engineering practice (SEP) engagement. Findings revealed that although separating home science interactions into distinct DCI and SEP factors represented the data well, the best overall representation of home science interactions was a one-factor model that included only home DCI engagement items. In addition, home DCI engagement was significantly predictive of children’s science core knowledge over and above a large group of covariates, including children’s age, race/ethnicity, sex, and performance on math, executive function, and vocabulary tasks as well as their parents’ education.}

abstract = {Radiometric dating methods are essential for developing geochronologies to study Late Quaternary environmental change and 210Pb dating is commonly used to produce age-depth models from recent (within 150 years) sediments and other geoarchives. The past two centuries are marked by rapid environmental socio-ecological changes frequently attributed to anthropogenic land-use activities, modified biogeochemical cycles, and climate change. Consequently, historical reconstructions over this recent time interval have high societal value because analyses of these datasets provide understanding of the consequences of environmental modifications, critical ecosystem thresholds, and to define desirable ranges of variation for management, restoration, and conservation. For this information to be used more broadly, for example to support land management decisions or to contribute data to regional analyses of ecosystem change, authors must report all of the useful age-depth model information. However, at present there are no guidelines for researchers on what information should be reported to ensure 210Pb data are fully disclosed, reproducible, and reusable; leading to a plethora of reporting styles, including inadequate reporting that reduces potential reusability and shortening the data lifecycle. For example, 64% of the publications in a literature review of 210Pb dated geoarchives did not include any presentation of age uncertainty estimates in modeled calendar ages used in age-depth models. Insufficient reporting of methods and results used in 210Pb dating geoarchives severely hampers reproducibility and data reusability, especially in analyses that make use of databased palaeoenvironmental data. Reproducibility of data is fundamental to further analyses of the number of palaeoenvironmental data and the spatial coverage of published geoarchives sites. We suggest, and justify, a set of minimum reporting guidelines for metadata and data reporting for 210Pb dates, including an IEDA (Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance), LiPD (Linked Paleo Data) and generic format data presentation templates, to contribute to improvements in data archiving standards and to facilitate the data requirements of researchers analyzing datasets of several palaeoenvironmental study sites. We analyse practices of methods, results and first order interpretation of 210Pb data and make recommendations to authors on effective data reporting and archiving to maximize the value of datasets. We provide empirical evidence from publications and practitioners to support our suggested reporting guidelines. These guidelines increase the scientific value of 210Pb by expanding its relevance in the data lifecycle. Improving quality and fidelity of environmental datasets broadens interdisciplinary use, lengthens the potential lifecycle of data products, and achieves requirements applicable for evidenced-based policy support.}

Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of a sample of 3617 articles from which 112 relevant articles have been identified, describing 117 studies on the evaluation of games for computing education. Based on these studies we analyzed how evaluations are defined (the analysis factors evaluated, research designs, evaluation models/methods used, kind of data collection instruments, etc.), how they have been executed (sample size and replications) and analyzed (data analysis methods used). As a result, we can confirm that most evaluations use a simple research design in which, typically, the game is used and afterwards subjective feedback is collected via questionnaires from the learners. The majority of the evaluations are run with small samples, without replication, using mostly qualitative methods for data analysis. We also observed that most studies do not use a well-defined evaluation model or method. This shows that there is a need for more rigorous evaluations as well as methodological support in order to assist game creators and instructors to improve such games as well as to systematically support decisions on when or how to include them within instructional units.}

abstract = {There is growing interest in teaching computer science and programming skills in schools. Here we investigated the efficacy of peer tutoring, which is known to be a useful educational resource in other domains but never before has been examined in such a core aspect of applied logical thinking in children. We compared (a) how children (N = 42, age range = 7 years 1 month to 8 years 4 months) learn computer programming from an adult versus learning from a peer and (b) the effect of teaching a peer versus simply revising what has been learned. Our results indicate that children taught by a peer showed comparable overall performance—a combination of accuracy and response times—to their classmates taught by an adult. However, there was a speed–accuracy trade-off, and peer-taught children showed more exploratory behavior, with shorter response times at the expense of lower accuracy. In contrast, no tutor effects (i.e., resulting from teaching a peer) were found. Thus, our results provide empirical evidence in support of peer tutoring as a way to help teach computer programming to children. This could contribute to the promotion of a widespread understanding of how computers operate and how to shape them, which is essential to our values of democracy, plurality, and freedom.}

The purpose of this study was to examine multiple concurrent predictors of science core knowledge, including executive functioning (EF), vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language in preschool. This study overcomes the limitations of previous work exploring relations between individual predictors, by addressing potentially spurious relations due to acting as proxies for other variables. Data were collected from 86 preschool-aged children (36 female) from families with low incomes. Findings revealed that when EF, vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language were included in the same model as concurrent predictors of science, only vocabulary significantly predicted children’s science core knowledge. Findings from this study have potential implications for the refinement of early science skills and intervention development.}

While extensive literature exists on the integration of AI technologies in educational settings, less emphasis has been placed on the critical role of teachers and their professional development needs. This study systematically reviews research conducted between 2015 and 2024 on teachers' use of AI technology in their teaching and professional development, focusing on the relationship between the supply of professional development opportunities and the demand for AI integration among teachers. Using PRISMA principles and protocols, this review identified and synthesized 95 relevant research articles. The findings reveal a significant imbalance in research focus. Specifically, 65% of the studies examined the application of AI in teaching, including technologies such as conversational AI and related technologies, AI-driven learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies, visual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. In contrast, only 35% of the studies explored AI's role in enhancing teacher professional development. This review highlights a gap in research addressing the development needs of teachers as they integrate AI technologies into their teaching practices. It emphasizes the need for future research to focus more on the potential of AI in teacher professional development and to investigate how AI technologies can be applied in education from both the perspectives of student learning and teacher instruction. Furthermore, research on AI in professional development should prioritize addressing technological and ethical challenges to ensure the responsible and effective integration of AI in education.}

However, although prior reviews in this context have generally focused on providing an overview of research trends and the impact of game-based learning on education, they have failed to provide noncrucial information on teacher scaffolding strategies used in the different stages of game-based learning and its related effects on students' learning in primary education. By conducting a systematic search of databases, the current review examines recent empirical studies, ranging from 2011 to the end of March 2022, that implemented game-based learning in primary education settings. Twenty-four relevant papers were selected by deploying a four-phase PRISMA framework. This review identified different teacher scaffolding strategies that are used in teacher–student interactions during the orientation and gameplay stages, and their correlative influence on students’ learning. These findings can help teachers, teacher educators, and game developers in designing and developing improved game-based learning. The requirement for more research to investigate the use of teacher scaffolding in teacher–student interactions within the game-based learning process in primary education is emphasized. Furthermore, recommendations are offered for the future implementation of teacher scaffolding in game-based learning research.}

abstract = {The invention of floatovoltaic technologies brought new meaning to the theoretical framing of sustainability as the technology delivers extended natural resource conservation benefits. However, planning assessments for this novel sustainable energy technology exposed knowledge gaps jeopardising global financial investments and regulatory approvals. Knowledge and methodological gaps cause inaccurate performance predictions in current geospatial-engineering modelling tools and fail to adequately quantify the diverse range of layered performance qualities and impacts of floating photovoltaics. This paper advances a geo-sensitive system dynamics framework to systemically integrate the energy, environmental and economic domain object functions in characterising the behaviour and sustainability of floating photovoltaic systems theoretically. The framework serves as computer logic in a geospatial digital twin to synthesise floatovoltaic operations to predict the technology’s sustainability impact and offset attributes in balanced scorecard metrics and water–energy–land–food nexus indicators. Experimental evaluations with the proposed framework in a real-world setting demonstrate the value of the holistically integrated framework in analytical floatovoltaic project appraisal and planning support. The results highlight significant advantages when comparing a 1000 m2 floatovoltaic system with a similar-sized conventional photovoltaic alternative, including a 19.3% lifetime energy gain, a carbon emission displacement of CO2e=5168t and a freshwater evaporation benefit of 983 kL. Predictive energy, environmental and economic modelling also offers water–energy–land–food–resource analysis parameters, thus delivering multi-attribute performance profiles that solve many of the current problems with the “technology unknowns” of floatovoltaics that impede energy project commissioning and licensing approvals.}

The competent use of digital systems (esp. information and communication technologies [ICT]) has thus become an essential skill. Despite longstanding research on human-technology interaction and diverse theoretical approaches describing competences for interacting with digital systems, research still offers mixed results regarding the structure of digital competences. Self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. Yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness. The present study aims at providing a systematic overview and comparison of existing measures of digital self-efficacy (DSE) to current theoretical digital competence frameworks. Further, we present a newly developed scale that assesses digital self-efficacy in heterogeneous adult populations, theoretically founded in the DigComp 2.1 and social-cognition theory. The factorial structure of the DSE scale is assessed to investigate multidimensionality. Further, the scale is validated considering the nomological network (actual ICT use, technophobia). Implications for research and practice are discussed.}

This study closely examines local government policy documents (n = 26) through the lens of RIT, employing directed content analysis with thematic data analysis software. The results reveal that: (a) Not all RIT characteristics have been given equal consideration in these policy documents; (b) Participatory and deliberate considerations were the most frequently mentioned responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (c) Adaptable, explainable, sustainable, and accountable considerations were the least present responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (d) Many of the considerations overlapped with each other as local governments were at the early stages of identifying them. Furthermore, the paper summarised strategies aimed at assisting local authorities in identifying their strengths and weaknesses in responsible AI characteristics, thereby facilitating their transformation into governing entities with responsible AI practices.

Theoretically, the affective domain of coding is in its infancy, and very few studies have set out to identify the determinants of coding interest and self-efficacy. This study explored how mathematics interest and self-efficacy, as two important mathematics-related factors, influenced coding interest and self-efficacy. Employing a quantitative cross-sectional survey design, 605 students from two public senior high schools in two big cities in China were investigated. A two-step structural equation modeling approach was adopted to analyze the data. Findings showed that mathematics interest, directly and indirectly, influenced coding interest significantly. In addition, coding self-efficacy was indirectly impacted by mathematics interest and coding interest was indirectly impacted by mathematics self-efficacy significantly. Most importantly, our model has proved to be powerful in explaining coding interest. This study contributes to the theoretical and practical understanding of the relationship between mathematics and coding attitudes, seldom explored in senior high school settings.}

Our work tries to define its scope and focuses on a popular subarea of it, namely “Digital Democracy”. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using digital technologies to promote more participatory forms of democracy. While there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. It is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. This paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies. We argue that more research on how digital technologies can be used to support democracy upgrade is needed. Along these lines, we lay out a research agenda for the future.}

abstract = {In the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) forum, learning engagement encompasses three fundamental dimensions—cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement—that intricately interact to jointly influence students' learning achievements. However, the interplay between multiple engagement dimensions and their correlations with learning achievement remain understudied, particularly across different academic disciplines. This study adopts an automated configurational approach that integrates bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of learning engagement, their connections with learning achievement, and variations across disciplines. Our analysis reveals a nuanced profile of learners' learning engagement, indicating the high-achieving individuals demonstrated more frequent posting and commenting behaviors and the high-level cognitive engagement than low-achieving individuals. Second, our analysis revealed multiple configurations where the coexistence or absence of factors at different levels of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions significantly impacted learning achievement. Learners who conducted posting and replying behaviors, expressed positive emotions, and engaged in deep cognitive engagement tended to achieve superior learning outcomes. Third, there were significant differences in behavioral and emotional engagement among learners across different academic disciplines. Specifically, pure discipline learners were more inclined to engage in posting behaviors than the applied discipline learners. Across academic disciplines, positive emotions correlated strongly with higher achievement. These findings deepen our understanding of the multifaceted characteristics of learning engagement in MOOCs and highlight the importance of disciplinary distinctions, providing a foundation for educators and designers to optimize learners’ MOOC effects and tailor learning experiences in diverse disciplinary contexts.}

abstract = {In 2013, the Forensic Science Undergraduate Program (FSUP) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico was created in response to an alarming criminal situation in Mexico, as well as to the radical reform of its criminal justice system. Its mission is to educate and train ethical, critical, and humanistic forensic scientists capable of conducting inquiries that meet scientific quality standards and assist the justice system in firmly linking legal rulings to the available evidence. At the time, it was the first such program in the country, and the contributions that interdisciplinary forensic scientists could make to criminal investigations were largely unknown among forensic and legal practitioners. During its existence, providing an interdisciplinary, competence-based education to students has been one of the main challenges. To overcome it, teaching and assessment approaches—centered on the achievement of specifically forensic competencies as learning outcomes and the integration of forensic disciplines towards the resolution of simulated cases—have been devised to help develop the professional skill set expected of graduates. The COVID-19 pandemic led to adapting these approaches to distance or hybrid modes of learning, increasing their versatility and enriching the pedagogic repertoire of the FSUP. Currently, the main impact of the program lies in the successful incorporation of some of its graduates to agencies belonging to or related to the criminal justice system, such as the National Prosecutor’s Office, the Commission for Truth and Justice for the Ayotzinapa Case, and the National Commission for the Search of Missing and Disappeared Persons, among others.}

abstract = {Previous studies have reported mixed results regarding the relationship between students’ use of self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies and their performance in introductory programming courses. These studies were constrained by their reliance on self-report questionnaires as a means of collecting and analysing data. To address this limitation, this study aimed to employ eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud techniques to identify differences in SRL strategy use for program comprehension tasks between high-performing students (N = 31) and low-performing students (N = 31) in an undergraduate programming course. All participants attended individual eye-tracking sessions to comprehend two Python program codes with different constructs. Their eye-tracking data and video-recalled retrospective think-aloud data were captured and recorded for analysis. The findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills, such as elaboration and critical thinking, were mostly adopted by high-performing students, while basic cognitive and resource management strategy, such as rehearsal and help-seeking, were mostly employed by low-performing students when comprehending the program codes. This study not only demonstrates the design of combining eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data to explore students’ use of SRL strategies but also provides evidence to support the notion that program comprehension is a complex process that cannot be effectively addressed by employing merely rudimentary strategies, such as repetitively reading the same code segment. In the future, researchers could explore the possibility of using a webcam to monitor and assess students’ online programming processes and provide feedback based on their eye movements. They could also examine the effects of SRL strategies training on students’ motivation, engagement, and performance in various types of programming activities.}

abstract = {Background
ChatGPT, a powerful artificial intelligence chatbot, has great potential for active learning because of its ability to generate instant responses to academic inquiries and foster spontaneous interactions.
Purpose
This exploratory study investigated the roles of intrinsic motivation and factors of the technology acceptance model that influence ChatGPT acceptance for active learning among undergraduates in Hong Kong.
Method
Using a structural equation modeling approach, we examined the extended technology acceptance model in the context of higher education. Using self-report questionnaires, we obtained useful responses from 473 undergraduate students in Hong Kong in July 2023. The reliability and validity of the data were measured using confirmatory factor analysis, followed by path analysis to investigate the hypotheses in the proposed model.
Results
We identified intrinsic motivation as the strongest motivator for ChatGPT use intention. Consistent with the prior literature on technology acceptance, perceived usefulness was found to be a strong predictor of behavioral intention. In contrast to extant research, the findings indicate no significant relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. Neither perceived usefulness nor perceived ease of use were significant mediators in the relationship between intrinsic motivation and behavioral intention.
Conclusion
These findings highlight the significant effect of intrinsic motivation on ChatGPT acceptance in supporting students’ active learning. They also provide inspiration for ChatGPT developers and educationalists regarding the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (perceived usefulness) in promoting the broader acceptance of chatbots in the educational context. Efforts should be made to improve students’ positive subjective experiences and the response quality of ChatGPT.}

The method used in this study is the quasi-experiment method. In this study, researchers used learning with augmented reality to find its effect on student learning outcomes in grade 8 junior high school, which has an average age of 13 years. The research design used in this study was a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group design. This study, 2 sample classes were taken: an experimental class (learning with augmented reality) and a control class (learning without augmented reality). The experimental and control classes have the same characteristics; each has 20 male and 20 female students. The instrument used in this research is a geometric thinking ability test. This study uses a test instrument in the form of essay questions. The instrument was given twice, namely during the pretest and post-test. There are ten essay questions made. After obtaining the data from the pretest and post-test results, the normalized gain score formula (N-Gain) was used to know the increase in geometric thinking skills. The N-Gain result of the experimental class is 78% or 0.78, which is in the high category. Whereas in the control class, it was 50% or 0.58, this result is in the moderate category. The N-gain results show that there is a difference between the experimental class and the control class. In this case, the effectiveness of using augmented reality for learning geometry in junior high school students is higher than those who did not receive augmented reality treatment. From the N-gain value, it proves that learning using augmented reality learning media is effective in increasing the ability to think Geometry. Then the results of observations made during learning activities using augmented reality show that students look active and make students more enthusiastic when learning Geometry. The results of the responses showed that 39 students had become more proactive in learning Geometry by using augmented reality applications.}

Although the term DC is used widely in research, scholars do not commit to a common definition. This integrative review investigates the conceptualizations and measurements of DC, across disciplines, in the extant literature. A systematic search of 11 databases identified a total of 350 unique items that contain “digital citizenship” in the title or keywords published by December 2018, with the majority published after 2010. Of these, 114 were peer-reviewed journal articles published in a wide range of discipline-specific venues, more than half of which were education-related. In-depth analyses show that each of the dominant conceptualizations of DC has been adopted by different disciplines, albeit with different popularities in adoption. Findings also revealed widely shared stakeholder concerns and research foci in DC research across the disciplines. However, there is a stark lack of empirical research on the young children, and an absence of commonly deployed research instruments in DC-related research. The present integrative review implicates the need for interdisciplinary collaboration for significant advances in DC research to address issues in policy and practice.}

Middle childhood also is marked by increasing digital game play, arguably the most common form of child–computer interactions during this developmental period. For example, children between the ages of 6 and 8 play digital games 60–90 min per day and 47% of 3rd to 8th grade teachers reported using digital games in their classrooms several times a week (Vega & Robb, 2019). Surprisingly, how content learning and cognition may be facilitated through digital gaming remains sparsely investigated among children during this period. In the studies that do examine the linkages between game play and content learning or cognition, research methodologies vary markedly. The goal of this narrative review is to help bring greater cohesion to the research literature, which often spans many disciplines. This review emphasizes the games, measurement of outcomes, and research designs that have been used to examine content learning and cognitive skills among children ages 6 to 12 in the context of digital games.}

Considering the current integration of AI in work processes, the requirements for sales managers' interpersonal communication competence (ICC) are likely to be modified. However, research on sales management competencies is surprisingly scarce. This longitudinal case study investigates sales managers' perceptions of their ICC needs in leading AI-integrated sales teams in the financial sector. During the years 2019–2024, 35 expert interviews with sales managers were collected from one of Scandinavia's largest financial groups. The findings indicate that AI system integration brought benefits, concerns and communication challenges to sales managers' job content. The main components related to sales managers' ICC in leading AI-integrated sales teams encompass both traditional competencies (motivation, knowledge, communication skills, and adaptability) but also include contextual AI factors and a concern for ethical reflectivity. A component model of managerial interpersonal communication competence in AI-integrated teams (MICCAIT) is produced and its implications are examined. Given the greater reliance on technology, sales managers may increasingly need to place greater emphasis on their empathy and people-oriented skills for the human employees remaining in the workplace.}

Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic rules and patterns) and functional linguistic competence (understanding and using language in the world). We ground this distinction in human neuroscience, which has shown that formal and functional competence rely on different neural mechanisms. Although LLMs are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance on functional competence tasks remains spotty and often requires specialized fine-tuning and/or coupling with external modules. We posit that models that use language in human-like ways would need to master both of these competence types, which, in turn, could require the emergence of separate mechanisms specialized for formal versus functional linguistic competence.}

Many research efforts were devoted to the definition of techniques performing such an anonymization. However the selection of the most relevant technique and the adequate algorithm is complex. Successful decision depends firstly on the ability of data publishers to understand the anonymization techniques and their associated algorithms. In this paper, we focus on the choice of an algorithm among the different ones implementing one of the anonymization techniques, namely generalization. Through an abstraction process presented in this paper, we provide data publishers with simplified descriptions for the generalization technique and its algorithms. These descriptions facilitate the understanding of the algorithms by data publishers having low programing skills. We present also some other use cases of these abstractions as well as an experimentation conducted to validate them.}

abstract = {Across the globe, wildfires are increasing in frequency and magnitude under a warming climate, impacting natural resources, infrastructure, and millions of people every year. At the same time, human encroachment into fire-prone areas has increased the potential for ignition, as well as risks and damages to human communities. In an era of intensifying human activities on Earth – the “Anthropocene” – societal interactions with post-fire landscapes are becoming commonplace. Yet, theories regarding post-fire impacts derived from individual disciplines no longer apply in cases where human interactions are intense. A holistic approach that accounts for interactions between natural and human systems is necessary to understand the altered dynamics of post-fire landscapes. Focusing on the intersection of fire, water, and society, this paper explores an integrative research framework to couple post-fire fluvial and human processes. We review trends in wildfires and growing impacts on humans, how fluvial processes and systems are altered by wildfires, and the potential hazards for human settlements. This review forms a basis for integrating societal concerns, such as vulnerability, economic impacts, and management responses. We then link disciplinary questions into broad interdisciplinary research through an integrative framework. The 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire (Colorado, USA) provides an illustrative case with intense human interactions, both during and after the fire, to formulate critical questions within the integrative framework. Utilizing emergent integrative conceptual frameworks and tools will assist scholars in meeting the challenges and opportunities for broad collaboration, which are necessary to understand and confront wildfires characteristic of the “Anthropocene.”}

We initially provide a brief summary of the idea of a 21st century skill, then trace the conceptual changes in the idea of ICT literacy in four main steps: First, we briefly describe a concentration of knowledge about computers and their use, coalescing into the concept of ICT literacy in the early years of the field. Second, we describe the transition to a view of ICT literacy as a broad set of skills that have links to many traditional and non-traditional school subjects, and the move to technology integration in education. Third, we see the next transition for ICT literacy expressed as progress variables that are essential tools for the design of curriculum and assessments. Fourth, we discuss the impact of the “social network” perspective on ICT literacy—the critical need for building the power of virtual skills through proficiency with networks of people, information, tools, and resources. In summary, we offer a new framework for assessing student ICT learning, based on a learning progression and social networking point of view. Throughout, we use extensive examples to help illustrate our review of the broad sweep of this development, and, as a part of the conclusion, we speculate about the coming next steps.}

Originally conceptualised as inequitable access to digital technologies and internet, it is now recognised that the ways in which individuals use digital technologies and the competencies they subsequently develop may also contribute to digital divides. The aims of the current study were twofold. Firstly, to investigate categories of screen media use outside of school for children at age eight, and whether children of this age fall into “user typographies”, whereby different “modes” of digital technology use have already started to emerge. Secondly, to consider the implications of different modes of use at 8 years of age for the establishment of digital divides. Using a sample of 5010 children participating in the Growing Up in New Zealand study, the results of factor analysis indicated six categories of screen-based activities (Social, Creative, Shopping, Educational, Entertainment, and Interests), while four different modes of digital technology use were identified via cluster analysis (Creative, Entertainment, Emergent, and Limited). While Entertainment Users and Creative Users engaged with most activities on a fairly regularly basis, Emergent Users, and in particular, Limited Users, engaged with a narrower range of activities and at lower frequencies. We argue that Entertainment Users and Creative Users who engage with a broader range of activities, and engage in Creative activities such as coding and programming outside of school, may be at an advantage with regard to digital divides. Possible strategies to help mitigate digital divides are proposed.}

ICT has become a subject of high importance in every context, particularly in the workplace; thus, a principal goal for universities and schools is to prepare future professionals capable of dealing with problems and searching for effective solutions by their digital competence as a key skill. In this regard, a new framework is developed to evaluate the main drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions (HEIs) in the era of industry 4.0. The developed framework is proposed a decision approach that can effectively use the presented information to make decisions of high rationality. This framework is applied to compute the subjective and objective criteria weights, and it is used to assess the preferences of organizations. An empirical case study to evaluate the main drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs is taken. According to the findings, the most significant drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0 are developing, updating, and adapting a curriculum (0.0425), integration of digital technologies for universal education (0.0420), and cloud computing (0.0419), respectively. Hence, the evaluation results also show that the option higher education institution (HEI)-4 has the highest overall utility degree (1.845) over different drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0. Also, comparison and sensitivity investigation are made to show the superiority of the developed framework.}

abstract = {Game-based learning and 21st century skills have been gaining an enormous amount of attention from researchers and practitioners. Given numerous studies support the positive effects of games on learning, a growing number of researchers are committed to developing educational games to promote students’ 21st century skill development in schools. However, little is known regarding how games may influence student acquisition of 21st century skills. This paper examines the most recent literature in regard to game-based learning and identified 29 studies which targeted 21st century skills as outcomes. The range of game genres and game design elements as well as learning theories used in these studies are discussed, together with the range of indicators, measures and outcomes for impacts on 21st century skills. The findings suggest that a game-based learning approach might be effective in facilitating students’ 21st century skill development. The paper also provides valuable insights for researchers, game designers, and educators in issues related to educational game design and implementation in general.}

We provided 22 (9–11-year-old) students with physical blocks for building vertical towers and conducted individual interviews with them as they completed a sequence of 15 tasks involving subtraction as difference using concrete, numeric, and symbolic representations. Relational thinking was evidenced across a range of subtraction calculation skill levels. Those students who could use both indirect addition and take-away strategies flexibly, depending on the size of the numbers involved, were more likely to evidence attention to generality with symbolic equations. The shift to symbolic equations elicited some students’ productive attempts to connect subtraction as difference and subtraction as take way but seemed to hinder others by provoking a return to take away calculations rather than relational thinking strategies.}

Responding to this problem, this article synthesizes these dispersed bodies of research to provide a state-of-the-art literature review of where and how 3D printing is being used in the education system. Through investigating the application of 3D printing in schools, universities, libraries and special education settings, six use categories are identified and described: (1) to teach students about 3D printing; (2) to teach educators about 3D printing; (3) as a support technology during teaching; (4) to produce artefacts that aid learning; (5) to create assistive technologies; and (6) to support outreach activities. Although evidence can be found of 3D printing-based teaching practices in each of these six categories, implementation remains immature, and recommendations are made for future research and education policy.}

However, it is still under-explored in early childhood education (ECE) since the AI curriculum for young children has just been designed in recent years. A scoping review was conducted to examine the thematic and content analysis of 16 empirical papers from 2016 to 2022. This scoping reviews evaluate, synthesize, and display 16 studies on AI literacy in early childhood education, including curriculum design, AI tools, pedagogical approaches, research designs, assessment methods, and findings. The discussion of the AI literacy implementation in ECE contributes to providing references for educators and researchers to design interventions to engage young children in AI learning. Further, we identified a set of challenges and opportunities of AI literacy. Several challenges included (1) lack of teachers' AI knowledge, skills, and confidence; (2) lack of curriculum design; and (3) lack of teaching guidelines. Although educators meet challenges at the beginning stage of developing AI instructional design for young children, AI learning could bring learning opportunities and foster young children's AI literacy in terms of AI concepts, practices and perspectives. We foresee that there will be a growing number of age-appropriate curriculum and tools for the ECE level. At the end, we also make some recommendations for future researchers and educators to improve AI literacy research and learning design in early childhood education.}

Today's increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. Algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be influenced by prejudice, conflicts of interest, or fatigue. However, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. In this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric AI: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy.}

abstract = {The motivation to stimulate children’s learning engagement could be found in the fact that learning is not always motivational in itself. This is particularly true when learning is obligatory and based upon material that has not been chosen by the children themselves. A Lean UX approach to the co-design of an educational serious videogame (MOBI) is proposed in this paper. The core idea is that children's natural interest in playing can be stimulated by engendering the feeling that they are participating in the creation of something. The hypothesis is that this approach can increase the children's level of engagement and can facilitate their awareness of their learning perception. With the aim of testing this hypothesis, this paper describes an experience with 50 children with ages between 10 and 12 years old. The results indicate that the children’s satisfaction grew significantly during the process, with an important reduction in the requests for changes and that 60% had the perception of having learned. It can be concluded that the co-design based upon a Lean UX methodology, of a children’s educational serious videogame increases their level of product engagement and facilitates their awareness of their learning perception.}

Students' self-regulation plays a critical role in interdisciplinary tasks. However, there is limited research investigating whether and how self-regulation leads to different learning outcomes among students in engineering design. This study analyzes the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade U.S. students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. It classifies the students into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. Competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform best in the task. Cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. In contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. Minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. The results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort. The results also offer new insights into STEM education and self-regulated learning with emerging learning analytics.}

This study proposes a creativity approach to facilitating participatory learning for the sustained engagement of young learners based on the principle of remix practice, which consists of learning to generate online artefacts, endless hybridization and scaffolding. This study investigated students' engagement in and perceptions of the creative learning process during a two-year participatory learning program. Data collected included students’ flow perceptions during a 39-week activity, their motivation and creative self-efficacy before and after the intervention, as well as their creative products. The findings indicated that the remix-oriented approach led to a higher level of intrinsic motivation and sustained flow compared to a model-based approach, especially interest and curiosity, in this participatory learning program. The approach also helped the students to perceive a significant increase in their level of creative self-efficacy associated with strategies to generate creative ideas. The results of this study suggest that the principle of remix practice is helpful for leveraging knowledge acquisition and the creative nature of participatory learning activities to sustain student engagement in participatory learning programs.}

VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.}

This research is of great significance, as it can have a profound impact on the way we think about knowledge acquisition in the future. Yet, a recent literature review finds that the academic community has not paid attention to this important topic. In the present work, which is based on a survey of 5000 Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic period, we find that COVID-19 information from mainstream Chinese media and overseas media as well as social media has had a significant promoting effect on the online knowledge acquisition of college students. At the same time, the psychological response to the pandemic situation is shown to have had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between the information impact from mainstream Chinese and overseas media and the online knowledge acquisition of college students. Our findings have shown that the more positive college students are in responding to the pandemic, the stronger their willingness is to acquire knowledge through online means, and the better effect this will have on them acquiring knowledge. The results of this paper have important implications for the optimization and improvement of college students’ education and knowledge acquisition methods in the context of the long-term COVID-19 pandemic.}

All commonly employed imaging modalities attempt to recapitulate this information in some useable form. Each technique, however, can only retrieve a small slice of spatial, temporal, or conceptual knowledge of the body area of interest. Furthermore, in some cases like computed tomography, a large amount of information is gathered without a clear strategy for manual or automated analysis. Current software developments are slowly realizing a convergence of medical imaging methodologies toward one of greater realism. For the purposes of this chapter, this “coming together” of disciplines will be delineated as the field of 3D graphics. Although this is a simplification, 3D graphics will be the primary foundation for a much larger hybridized field whose aim will be the creation of informative and accurate medical spatial representations. To understand how this will affect the clinical fields, we will need to first explore 3D graphics more holistically, delving into areas of physical simulation, 3D movie rendering, video game development, and the expansion of 3D visualization hardware. As we explore these fields, we will relate each of these subdomains to analogous examples in the medical field, also documenting opportunities for commercialization and innovation.}

Understanding how virtual learning environments (VLEs) can foster WHC is becoming exceedingly important because it problematizes the marketisation of childhood and youth. It also offers new ways of considering educational futures including implications for the theoretical understanding of creativity within VLEs. We report on the theoretical development of the concept of WHC within C2Learn, a three-year project designing a digital gaming environment that provides children and young people with multiple opportunities to engage in co-creativity to foster their WHC. C2Learn is the first time WHC has actively been conceptualised in a digital context. We present our over-arching co-creativity conceptual framework which has been developed to frame the specific kind of co-creativity that is envisaged within C2Learn’s VLE. Drawing on that framework, we present a co-creativity assessment methodology specifically focused on evaluating the presence of WHC. We argue that leveraging WHC within VLEs broadens perspectives on the purposes of education, as this ethically framed creativity foregrounds the role of values in generating fundamental small-scale creative change through ‘journeys of becoming’ that have the potential to generate ‘quiet revolutions’ or small cumulative, incremental changes over time which are meaningful to a particular community.}

OJ systems provide a platform for learners to practice programming skills, submit solutions, and receive feedback. They offer a conducive environment for learners to engage in hands-on coding exercises and enhance their programming abilities. This article explores the use of OJ systems as a software tool for enhancing programming education in engineering. It investigates how the difficulty and order of programming problems affect the users' behavior, performance, and cognitive load in OJ environments. The research data were sourced from Project_CodeNet. Using statistical methods, such as Spearman correlation analysis and differential analysis, the study reveals the factors that influence the users' submission situations, answer order, and learning outcomes. The findings provide useful implications for OJ system developers, teachers, and learners in designing, implementing, and using OJ systems for programming education in engineering. The study suggests that problem difficulty and order should be considered and adjusted according to the users' abilities and progress, to provide appropriate challenges and support, balance the cognitive load, and improve the programming skills of the users.}

With the visual pedagogical scaffold, for instance, mind maps, learners can externalize their comprehension and engage in meaning negotiation. However, given the limitations posed by the conventional collaborative environment such as the difficulty for groups to achieve deep discussions and generate group intelligence, the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tool was introduced. The efficacy of the GAI tool in boosting task performance is still contested and its influence on collaborative knowledge construction remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted in an elective course at a university. A total of 30 student teachers were the participants, including 10 groups of 3 students. In the subsequent quasi-experimental study, 5 experimental groups employed the GAI tool and mind mapping based collaborative environment (GMMCE) and 5 control groups employed the conventional mind mapping based collaborative environment (MMCE). The results showed that the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on both collaborative tasks in the course. According to Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), the experimental groups developed a collaborative knowledge construction process in cognitive dimension, i.e., progressive interaction from individual to peer to group. On the contrary, the control groups were mainly reflected in the transition between learners' individual expression and peer interaction since they were more centered on the regulative dimension. We also supplemented students’ perception of using the GAI tool from the interview data. Finally, we highlighted the implications for pedagogy and described the research limitations as well as future directions.}

Respondents were asked to rate each skill based on the degree to which it was developed during their studies. Domain-general skills scored higher than STEM-specific skills or soft (interpersonal) skills, whereas STEM-specific skills scored higher than soft skills. Content analysis revealed nine methods of teaching and learning through which skills developed. The four active methods had a small effect on domain-general skills, while the five passive methods had a medium-to-large effect on these skills. Active methods had a medium-size effect on both STEM-specific and soft skills, whereas passive methods had no effect on either group.

There are many methods to analyze speech imagery signals, but those based on deep neural networks achieve the best results. However, more research is necessary to understand the properties and features that describe imagined phonemes and words. In this paper, we analyze the statistical properties of speech imagery EEG signals from the KaraOne dataset to design a method that classifies imagined phonemes and words. With this analysis, we propose a Capsule Neural Network that categorizes speech imagery patterns into bilabial, nasal, consonant-vocal, and vowels/iy/ and/uw/. The method is called Capsules for Speech Imagery Analysis (CapsK-SI). The input of CapsK-SI is a set of statistical features of EEG speech imagery signals. The architecture of the Capsule Neural Network is composed of a convolution layer, a primary capsule layer, and a class capsule layer. The average accuracy reached is 90.88%±7 for bilabial, 90.15%±8 for nasal, 94.02%±6 for consonant–vowel, 89.70%±8 for word-phoneme, 94.33%± for/iy/ vowel and, 94.21%±3 for/uw/ vowel detection. Finally, with the activity vectors of the CapsK-SI capsules, we generated brain maps to represent brain activity in the production of bilabial, nasal, and consonant-vocal signals.}

abstract = {Introduction
Higher education institutions face persistent challenges of student retention and academic progress. Personalized adaptive learning has the potential to address these issues as it leverages educational technology to tailor learning pathways according to individual student needs.
Objective
To elucidate the key characteristics of personalized adaptive learning in higher education and its impact on academic performance and engagement.
Methods
The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology was followed. Key international databases were searched to retrieve articles. The titles and abstracts of selected studies were imported into Covidence. Peer-reviewed journal articles, theses, and dissertations focusing on undergraduate students engaged in personalized adaptive learning, published between 2012 and 2024 were included. Data was extracted and charted in Covidence. Results were summarised through a narrative synthesis and visually presented in a PRISMA-ScR flow diagram.
Results
This review included 69 eligible studies. The findings reveal insights into the multifaceted nature of personalized adaptive learning, which include platforms, implementation strategies, perceived strengths and limitations by instructors and students. Pre-knowledge quizzes were reported as the most common indicator for activating adaptive content delivery, and McGraw-Hill's Connect LearnSmart and Moodle were the most utilized adaptive platforms. Improved academic performance was reported by 41 of the studies (n = 41, 59 %), and 25 studies (n = 25, 36 %) indicated increased student engagement.
Conclusion
This study highlights the potential of personalized adaptive learning to positively impact academic performance, student engagement and learning, despite technological limitations. Further research is encouraged to address technological challenges, build on strengths and refine implementation and application of personalized adaptive learning in higher education.}

Our goal is to identify research approaches and uncover research gaps. To achieve this, we reviewed literature published within the timeframe of 2012–2022 found in the ACM, IEEE, ERIC, and Science Direct databases. In total, we identified 18 relevant papers, for which we collected and evaluated research objectives, approaches, results, and areas requiring further investigation. Our findings reveal that most of the literature examined focuses with students' attitudes toward AI and moderating variables. Additionally, there is preliminary research on the types of mental models students possess about AI. Notable research gaps include the absence of development of research instruments for surveying mental models and insufficient research into the impact of learning interventions on the construction of students' mental models.}

This study aimed to examine how imaginative capabilities act as a mediator between personality traits and academic performance, and to compare the different ways these factors affect engineering and science majors. The hypotheses were tested with data from five universities across different regions in Taiwan. The participants were a sample of 700 undergraduates, who were divided into engineering and science groups. The results showed that, through the mediator effect of imaginative capabilities, conscientiousness had the greatest impact on academic performance among engineering and science groups. Agreeableness was identified as the second major predictor of student performance in both groups. The influence of openness on student performance was slight and positive, whereas that of extraversion was slight and negative. The major differences in personality, imagination and performance structures between the two groups were the direct results of agreeableness, extraversion, initiating imagination, and conceiving imagination.}

A cost-effective strategy has been implemented by using a low-technology and high-performance approach. This work aims to reduce energy consumption and provide comfort conditions by learning user behavior.

abstract = {There is growing diversity in the design of introductory programming environments. Where once all novices learned to program in conventional text-based languages, today, there exists a growing ecosystem of approaches to programming including graphical, tangible, and scaffolded text environments. To date, relatively little work has explored the relationship between the design of novice programming environments and the programming practices they engender in their users. This paper seeks to shed light on this dimension of learning to program through the careful analysis of novice programmers’ experiences learning with a hybrid block/text programming environment. Specifically, this paper is concerned with how novices leverage the various affordances designed into programming environments and programming languages to support their early efforts to author programs. We explore this relationship through the construct of modality using data from a study conducted in a high school computer science classroom in which students spent five weeks working in block-based, text-based, and hybrid block/text programming environments. This paper uses a detailed vignette of a novice writing a program in the hybrid environment as a way to characterize emerging programming practices, then presents analyses of programming trends from the full study population to speak to the generality of the practices identified in the vignette. The analyses focus not only on characterizing authoring strategies but also on identifying patterns in novices’ help-seeking behaviors. By focusing on how modality influences novices’ emerging programming practices, this paper contributes to our understanding of the relationship between programming environment and learning, illuminating the role of design in shaping introductory programming experiences.}

A total of 76 studies with Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) as a multilevel modeling technique in 13 major e-learning journals from January 2000 to September 2022, published in the Web of Science, were reviewed. We assessed the applications of the following key criteria: reasons for using HLM, data characteristics, sample characteristics, model characteristics, variables used in the research, software use, and main technology used in the research. The results revealed that two-level models and random-intercept models are mostly used in multilevel model building. Moreover, most e-learning studies included two-level random intercept models with “students” as sampling units of analysis in Level 1, and “cognitive learning” (i.e., examination score, learning achievement) as the dependent variable in Level 1. Based on our review results, we provide suggestions and potential applications of using multilevel modeling in e-learning studies.}

This study aims to review the empirical research activity concerning the acceptance of ARSGs in all applicable fields. In total, 21 studies published from 2015 to 2022 have been reviewed. Their relative field, theoretical framework, methodological design, and the factors that were found to affect the acceptance or use of ARSGs were recorded. It was found that the research focuses more on users acting as consumers of the glasses than on professionals (e.g., doctors, teachers, athletes) using them in a specific field. Also, the majority of the studies base their theoretical framework either entirely or in part on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Moreover, the research models of these studies extend TAM by using various additional variables, such as privacy risk and external influence. Methodologically speaking, most of the studies follow the quantitative approach, without giving the participants the opportunity to interact with the glasses. In addition, the factors which were found to influence the acceptance or use of the glasses are varied and can be categorised as utilitarian, social, personal, risk-related, and technological. This review adds value to the theory of technology acceptance. This is because it is one of the first to address the acceptance or use of ARSGs. Since there is no acceptance model for ARSGs, the findings of this review could lead researchers to propose models for accepting ARSGs in various fields, such as education.}

The purpose of this paper is to report on key issues that arose when embedding immersive virtual reality for learning into ICT and science classes in low-income high schools by providing a fine-grained account of how the research team negotiated scholarly and practical problems. The mixed method research used a participatory approach with teachers as co-researchers. Three areas are explored: (i) the ethical and safety issues of using IVR in classrooms; (ii) negotiating the organisational context of a school system and problem-solving within the context of institutional restrictions on internet access; and (iii) educational reflections on collaborative learning and gendered dynamics. We conclude that classrooms, as socially active and sometimes unpredictable places, yield unique and credible insights into the deployment of highly immersive virtual reality for learning.}

However, research investigating the use of simulations in early years' science learning is limited. This study applied revisions of Kolb's Experiential Learning theoretical model to determine if age-indicated science simulations were effective for teaching 5 year olds simple circuit building procedures and electricity concepts, and the function of circuit components. It also explored whether their engagement with the simulations provided worthwhile opportunities to exercise higher order capabilities such as reflective thinking and abstraction – skills oftencited in literature as valuable outcomes from older student and adult use of simulations. Findings indicate students developed a solid base of procedural knowledge about constructing different circuits, and functional knowledge about circuit components they applied to different circuit designs. The emergence of tentative, generalised theories about current and the effects of different circuit designs on the performance of resistors - linked to the exercise of reflective and descriptive thinking, were also noted in many students. However, examples were found of some simulations appearing to foster common misconceptions, such as current being ‘consumed’ by resistors – indicating teachers need to be highly vigilant and work closely with students, to ensure accurate understandings are developed. Overall, with appropriate teacher support and careful selection and review, the study concludes simulations can be effective for introducing young students to simple physical science concepts, and for providing them with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking processes.}

The i-MOOC is a blended MOOC developed and refined in a design research process; it meets established criteria for high-quality MOOCs. In 2020, 1032 upper secondary level students in German-speaking Switzerland took the i-MOOC; the sample comprises N = 167 students who voluntarily filled in a questionnaire. The students are mainly from high schools and vocational schools. Learning effects are captured with a performance test. Information literacy gains are significant and medium in size: d = 0.75. The technology acceptance of students is evaluated using the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2). Student technology acceptance of K-12 MOOCs is primarily driven by hedonic motivation, i.e., perceived fun and entertainment. However, this type of motivation negatively predicts learning gains. Implications for teachers and educational decision makers are discussed.}

Previous research on 21st century skills has shown that digital skills evolve sequentially, building on digital information skills, making them the key to future skills that teachers should acquire and be able to pass on to future generations. In the research on digital skills, shortcomings of bivariate approaches have been widely identified and interest has largely shifted to multivariate methods. However, the development of effective targeted interventions still requires a deeper understanding of the social resources of individuals and the interdependencies of predictors. This study examined the extent to which sociodemographic factors and available resources predict digital information skills and which subgroups emerge as potential targets for interventions, by analysing the interdependence of the predictor variables. The empirical data used in the study consisted of 4988 Finnish teachers' questionnaire responses and performance test results. Utilising the multiple regression analysis, the study found that digital activity and age explain most of the variation in teachers' digital information skills. Their effect was found to be the inverse of each other, with abundant digital activity increasing and age reducing teachers’ mastery of these skills. Digital self-efficacy and in-service training also emerged as promising predictors, highlighting that teachers' information skills are explained more strongly by the available resources than by sociodemographic factors. At the end, the practical significance and recommendations for more targeted interventions as well as for further research are considered on the basis of the results obtained.}

However, the teaching and learning of concepts related to size and scale present major challenges because objects at certain scales are unable to be perceived by humans with the naked eye. A potential way to overcome this challenge could be by means of learning strategies coupled with multimedia learning. In this study we propose learning strategies, instantiated by multimedia are for learning tools that may result in improved learning of size and scale cognition based on the FS2C framework. This framework consists of five levels to characterize size and scale cognition and the cognitive processes supporting them. Participants of this quasi-experimental design included 224 undergraduate students who experienced one of three different multimedia for learning tools, and then were assessed through five tasks whose design was based on the FS2C framework. Results suggest that learning strategies prompting students to compare objects of different sizes, may increase their abilities in ordering and classifying objects. Having students to interact with a logarithmic scale may also have increased participant posttest performance scores in the numerical proportional and absolute measurement tasks. Finally, we propose that the use of multimedia for learning affordances like 3D interaction, zoom in and zoom out, and direct interaction with a scale metaphor may help students make explicit connections and become familiar with objects of different sizes and scales.}

abstract = {Background
Digital behavioral interventions have become increasingly popular for their ability to support patient diagnosis and treatment, chronic disease self-management, behavior change, and adherence to recommended care. However, digital intervention development is impeded by challenges such as limited technical skills, limited access to developers, and cost. The purpose of this study is to elicit in-depth qualitative feedback from intervention developers who have interest in digital behavioral interventions but lack programming skills regarding the barriers they experience and key considerations in the design and implementation of digital interventions.
Objective
This study aims to understand barriers in the design and implementation of digital behavioral interventions, as well as to identify key considerations for researchers who are developing these interventions.
Methods
We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 18 researchers who had experience either designing (but not coding) digital behavioral interventions or running research studies with them. Participants were a convenience sample of users of the Computerized Intervention Authoring System platform, an existing no-code development platform for building digital intervention content, and were recruited through either direct email solicitation or snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted and recorded over videoconference between February and April 2020. Recordings from interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed by multiple coders.
Results
Interviews were completed with 18 participants and lasted between 24 and 65 (mean 46.9, SD 11.3) minutes. Interviewees were predominantly female (17/18, 94%) and represented different job roles, ranging from researcher to project/study staff. Three key barriers in the development of digital behavior interventions were identified during interviews: lack of cross-disciplinary understanding; variability in recipients’ technology access, infrastructure, and literacy; and the idea that evidence-based in-person interactions do not translate directly to digital interactions. Interviewees identified several key considerations that interventionists learned to prioritize, which have the potential to overcome these barriers and lead to successful interventions.
Conclusions
Barriers in the development of digital behavioral interventions are often created by a lack of cross-disciplinary understanding, which can lead to difficulties conceptualizing interventions, unrealistic expectations in terms of cost, and confusion about the development process. Moreover, concerns about research study participant characteristics and access to technology, as well as the translation of in-person interventions to digital, are apparent. Appropriate training in how to work with software development teams may help future digital behavior intervention creators overcome these barriers and may lead to new, exciting innovations in this space.}

Children’s perceptions of and interactions with robots is a well-researched topic, but more focus is needed on the important role of play in Child–Robot Interaction. Play is essential to how children experience the world and thereby presents both opportunities and challenges for designers who aim to create positive experiences for children involving robots. We present a study investigating how a simple play-facilitating cardboard robot becomes a social interface and create meaningful and playful experiences for preschool children. We observed 214 children engaged in free play with the robot. The analysis produced four social interaction themes and five play patterns, illustrating the most salient reactions. The results show that the robot was successful in enabling play and that the children indeed treated the robot both as a social agent, but also as a material object. In line with existing research, our observations suggest that the children attributed both animate and inanimate properties to the robot, possibly explaining the duality of the observed playground behavior. We use these findings to provide four implications for the design of play-facilitating robots.}

Scholars refer to this shift in becoming creators of technology as computational making, which enables new forms of learning and thinking at the intersection of the physical and the digital. The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making. Our insights highlight a significant need for sharing scholarship and design work on implementing design scaffolds in computational making contexts toward the collective goal of developing a system of design scaffolds to effectively support learners’ thinking across the interdisciplinary, multimodal problem spaces unique to computational making.}

abstract = {It is vital to develop an understanding of students' self-regulatory processes in the domains of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) for the quality delivery of STEM education. However, most studies have followed a variable-centered approach, leaving open the question of how specific SRL (Self-regulated Learning) behaviors group within individual learners. Furthermore, little is known about how students' SRL profiles unfold over time in STEM education, specifically in the context of engineering design. In this study, we examined the change of students’ SRL profiles over time as 108 middle school students designed green buildings in a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We identified three distinct SRL profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and minimally self-regulated learners. In addition, we found that students with different profile memberships differed significantly in their design performance. Specifically, adaptive self-regulated learners outperformed minimally self-regulated learners on design completeness, whereas reflective-oriented self-regulated learners demonstrated higher design efficiency than minimally self-regulated learners. This study provides researchers with both theoretical and methodological insights concerning SRL dynamics. Findings from this research also inform practitioners about the design of adaptive interventions.}

abstract = {STEM teachers are critical mediators of knowledge, and their performance can directly impact students' learning experiences and knowledge acquisition. To ensure the quality of STEM instruction, countries worldwide have launched STEM teacher professional development (TPD) programs. It is paramount to know how these programs have been implemented and what lessons can be learned from them. In this study, to capture the trends in publications on K-12 STEM TPD, we systematically reviewed relevant journal papers published in the Web of Science database from 2006 to 2020. We analyzed the (1) knowledge foci, (2) professional development approaches, (3) outcome measurements, as well as (4) data sources of the STEM TPDs. In addition, to inform future professional development designs, we selected and developed narrative descriptions of three exemplary cases. These cases showcased high-quality TPD and covered pre-service and in-service teachers in formal and informal settings. We reviewed the knowledge foci of the STEM TPDs using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The results showed that the types of knowledge delivered in the STEM TPD programs were mostly pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, while a certain number of programs focused on technological content knowledge and technological pedagogical content knowledge. Most of the studies adopted mixed professional development approaches, featuring activities like learning by design, learning by doing, reflective learning, and group work. These approaches emphasized the active participation of teachers in the process, built links between content and classroom practices, and encouraged collective participation in developing expertise. However, the data were mostly collected through interviews or survey instruments. Future research should move beyond analyzing data on teachers’ perceptions to explore processes (e.g., online participation logs, teacher-peer interactions) and products of performance (e.g., lesson plans, handmade crafts) to further examine the effects of STEM TPD activities. It would also be desirable to establish greater consistency in data collection approaches, such as by using validated interview or observation protocols that are generalizable to different school settings.}

This allows for the management of professional output, the efficient interpretation of data, and completion of scientific research on data collected in geologically distinct regions. Machine learning methods and applications integrate large sets of information with the goal of efficient pattern recognition and the capability of leveraging accurate decision making. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning methods to the supervised classification of lithologies using multivariate log parameter data from offshore wells from the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). According to the analysis of the lithologies proposed in the IODP Expeditions and for the application of our methods, the lithologies were divided into four groups. The IODP Expeditions were organized into four templates for better results in analyzing the set of expeditions and practical application of the methods. The templates were submitted to training, validation, and testing by multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The evaluation was randomly divided into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) using the classification methods as an evaluation of the results. In the results, it was observed that Template1 (IODP Expedition 362) obtained better results with the MLP method, Template2 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, and 359) and Template3 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, 359, and 362) obtained better results with the random forest method with greater than 80.00% accuracy. For cross-validation, the random forest method performed well in all scenarios. In the practical template, the G2 group obtained a better result with the MLP method with an average accuracy above 85.00%. It is expected that machine learning methods can help improve the study of geology with accurate and rapid answers related to interpreting collected data in different study regions.}

Yet the sparse and incomplete nature of this record often makes it impossible to inferentially reconstruct past societies in sufficient detail for them to serve as more than very general cautionary tales of coupled socio-ecological systems. However, when formal and computational modeling is used to experimentally simulate human socioecological dynamics, the empirical archaeological record can be used to validate and improve dynamic models of long term change. In this way, knowledge generated by archaeology can play a unique and valuable role in developing the tools to make more informed decisions that will shape our future. The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics project offers an example of using the past to develop and test computational models of interactions between land-use and landscape evolution that ultimately may help guide decision-making.}

abstract = {Distributed memory programming, typically through the MPI library, is the de facto standard for programming large scale parallelism, with up to millions of individual processes. Its dominant paradigm of Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) programming is different from threaded and multicore parallelism, to an extent that students have a hard time switching models. In contrast to threaded programming, which allows for a view of the execution with central control and a central repository of data, SPMD programming has a symmetric model where all processes are active all the time, with none privileged, and where data is distributed. This model is counterintuitive to the novice parallel programmer, so care needs to be taken how to instill the proper ‘mental model’. Adoption of an incorrect mental model leads to broken or inefficient code. We identify problems with the currently common way of teaching MPI, and propose a structuring of MPI courses that is geared to explicit reinforcing the symmetric model. Additionally, we advocate starting from realistic scenarios, rather than writing artificial code just to exercise newly-learned routines.}

That is, the public gave higher scores to the algorithm's work when it was notified as the real author, but they gave lower scores to the algorithm's work when the author was notified as a journalist. It confirmed the public's negative attitude toward journalists' credibility and craving for new information and communication technology (ICT) products/services in Korea. Based on journalists' resistance to change and innovation and the theory of prejudice, it was expected that journalists would be favorable to another journalist's work and unfavorable to an algorithm's work. However, contrary to the hypothetical expectation, journalists also gave higher scores to an algorithm's work and lower scores to a journalist's work.

The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question.

This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.}

Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.}

Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking.}

In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo.

However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.}

abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice.}

abstract = {Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed.}

abstract = {In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century.}

However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience.}

Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning.}

There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education.}

By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context.}

abstract = {In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children.}

However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction.}

Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers.}

abstract = {Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity.}

To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education.}

Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.}

To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.}

abstract = {The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.}

abstract = {In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named "Play with me in Code" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future.}

Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.}

To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use.

Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both.}

CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens.}

Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking.

Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education.}

Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information.

We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action.

This study adopted correlation analysis and cross-lagged regression analysis in a longitudinal study to separately explore the bidirectional predictive effect of STEM academic achievement, language academic achievement, and CT skills of 1,487 Chinese primary school students in grades 4–6 (11–12 years old), and explored the moderating role of gender. The results showed that there were significant bidirectional predictions between students’ STEM and language academic achievements and CT skills, which further confirmed the feasibility and advantages of integrating CT in STEM and language subjects. In addition, gender only played a moderating role in the predictions of students’ CT skills on their language academic achievement. Implications for reducing the gender differences in STEM and CT fields are also discussed. The research results will provide references to integrating CT into the curriculum of basic education and improving the development of primary school students’ CT skills and promoting STEM teaching practice.}

The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.}

However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences.}

abstract = {Theory
The successful implementation of computational thinking into primary schools requires that primary school teachers feel safe and confident in teaching this topic to young learners. However, many student teachers face low expectancy of success and heightened anxiety towards computational thinking. Self-worth theory suggests that this may lead to a self-worth threat and in consequence to engagement in self-protective behaviours, hampering the successful acquisition of skills needed to implement computational thinking into their future classrooms.
Aims
This study aims to investigate potential self-worth threats as amplifiers of student teachers’ resistance to engage in computational thinking.
Method
323 student teachers participated in the study. Participants filled out a questionnaire on expectancy of success and anxiety towards computational thinking, and rated how likely they were to engage in self-protective behaviours, i.e., self-handicapping, avoiding novelty, and academic cheating, when learning about computational thinking at the start of the semester.
Results
Students showed heightened levels of anxiety and low levels of expectancy towards computational thinking. Further, they reported that they would be likely to engage in self-protective behaviours. A structural equation model showed that anxiety towards computational thinking was positively related to self-protective behaviours. Moreover, expectancy had a negative indirect effect via anxiety towards computational thinking on self-protective behaviours.
Discussion
Student teachers might experience self-worth threats when learning about computational thinking and engage in self-protective behaviours that might hamper their success. Our findings caution the impact of possible self-worth threats on teaching methods, thus influencing children's learning in the 21st century.}

abstract = {Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms.}

Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported.}

In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature.}

abstract = {Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing.}

Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation.}

The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area.}

Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.}

This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT.}

Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge.}

While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic.}

After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications.}

This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities.}

The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research.}

Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving.}

This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education.}

However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success.}

To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.}

This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT.}

We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing.}

abstract = {In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.}

By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.}

In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology.}

However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction.}

Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland.}

To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns.}

This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction.}

The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills.

However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education.}

abstract = {Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.}

As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.}

Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender.}

abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.}

However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education.}

The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).}

The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism.}

Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.}

As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction.}

This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes.

However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future.}

The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs.}

abstract = {The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.}

abstract = {There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.}

abstract = {The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.}

It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences.}

However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls.}

Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration.}

abstract = {Currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in programming courses. It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23). The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors.}

Big research efforts are made to determine which pedagogical means should be used. One research trend is based on the idea that teaching programming since Primary Education suffices to improve CT. In our previous work, we proposed and validated a methodology based on metaphors and used of Scratch (MECOPROG) to teach basic programming concepts to children. It is our hypothesis H that by applying MECOPROG, students will develop their CT. To check H, we carried out an experiment with 132 Primary Education Students (9–12 years in age). At the beginning of the experiment, all students were asked to fill in a programming concepts test and two tests to measure their CT. During the sessions, all students were taught according to MECOPROG. Finally, they took the three tests again. A significant increase in the results on all the tests has been measured, supporting the use of metaphors and Scratch to teach computer programming concepts to Primary Education students to develop their CT.}

The aim of this research is to characterise algorithmic thinking in a university context of the Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics by unplugged tasks, offering a model of analysis through categories that establish connections between mathematical and algorithmic working spaces in three dimensions, semiotic, instrumental and discursive. The results confirm the interaction between these dimensions and their predictive value for better programming performance. The study also adds novel considerations related to the role and interaction of mathematical and computational thinking categories involved in algorithmic thinking.}

A two-parameter logistic model was chosen over other IRT models, as it indicated an acceptable model fit and item fit. The discrimination parameters indicated that the instrument could effectively distinguish between students with various ability levels. Nominal response modelling in IRT was used to retrieve information from the students' responses, and those with a lower ability level were found to only consider one of the conditions provided, had no understanding of the repetition structure, and might have difficulties in associating a sprite with its corresponding codes. Based on ability estimates, we also found that the students’ ability in terms of CT concepts increased with grades and that boys generally performed slightly better than girls. These results suggest that the instrument can be used to examine the learning achievements of students in terms of CT concepts.}

Study 1 reports on the effectiveness of two 12-h courses using Scratch and App Inventor programming environments for CT development of teachers respectively, which involved 245 teachers from 47 primary schools. With teaching practices embedded, the programme, which used the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), significantly enhanced teachers' content-related knowledge dimensions. The results indicate that the programme helped teachers develop advanced CT concepts such as data structures and procedures. Study 2, using thematic analysis, reports on CT strategies implemented in 47 schools through 94 school visits. The most mentioned strategies were the formation of teaching teams, lesson co-planning, and the integration of CT with subject teaching. The most mentioned challenges were teacher readiness, lesson time, and diversity – learners' abilities, interests, and approaches. Four types of support, including teacher development support, continuous and communal support, teaching materials support, and financial support were identified. The results suggest that a course-based programme with mixed programming environments and embedded teaching experience effectively develops teachers’ capabilities. However, continuous support for teachers in implementing the initiative after completing the programme is important, especially in addressing learner diversity and integrating CT with subject teaching.}

We conducted mixed-methods research with 203 secondary school girls (in the state of Victoria, Australia) and 31 mentors attending a girls-only CT program (OzGirlsCT program). The girls were grouped into 52 teams and collaboratively developed computational solutions around realistic, important problems to them and their communities. We distributed two surveys (with 193 responses each) to the girls. Further, we surveyed the mentors (with 31 responses) who monitored the girls, and collected their observation reports on their teams Our study indicates that the girls found “debugging” the most difficult type of CT practice to apply, while collaborative practices of CT were the easiest. We found that prior coding experience significantly reduced the difficulty level of only one CT practice - “debugging”. Our study also identified six challenges the girls faced and six best practices they adopted when working on their computational solutions.}

JeanetteWing’s seminal work on Computational Thinking (CT) is an important landmark for this goal: CT represents a way of thinking, a set of problem-solving skills which can be valuable when interacting with digital technologies, and with different fields of knowledge, such as Arts and Humanities. Even if this cross-areas relevance has been celebrated and acknowledged in theoretical research, there has been a lack of practical projects exploring these links between CT and non-STEM fields. This research develops these links. We present a specific case – a game produced by two 14 years-old boys – within Playing Beowulf, a collaboration with the British library’s Young Researchers programme, in which students aged 13–14 from an inner-London (UK) school have developed games based on their own readings of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf during an after-school club. The game was produced using MissionMaker, a software (currently under development at UCL Knowledge Lab) that allows users to create and code their own first-person 3D games in a simple way, using pre-made 3D assets, such as rooms, props, characters and weapons and a simplified programming language manipulated through drop-down lists. We argue that MissionMaker, by simplifying the development process (low floor), can be a means to foster the building of knowledge in both STEM (CT) and Arts and Humanities, building bridges between these two areas inside and outside traditional schooling.}

The validity and reliability of the scale have been studied by conducting exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, item distinctiveness analyses, internal consistency coefficients and constancy analyses. As a result of the conducted analyses, it has been concluded that the scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that could measure the computational thinking skills of the students. In addition; the digital age individuals are expected to have the computational thinking skill, and at what degree they have these skills, the revelation of whether the levels they have are sufficient or not are a requirement. Within this frame, it could be said that the scale could make significant contributions to the literature.}

However, scant if any attention has been paid to ML in computing education, which continues to teach rule-based programming. A new, promising research field in education consists of acquainting children with ML to foster this much-needed shift from traditional rule-driven thinking to ML-based data-driven thinking. This article presents the development of computational thinking competencies in 12-year-old students who participated in a learning-by-design or a learning-by-teaching ML course. The results, based on a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the students’ achievements, indicate that they demonstrated computational thinking competencies at various levels. The learning by design group evidenced greater development in computational skills, whereas the learning by teaching group improved in terms of computational perspective. These findings are discussed with respect to promoting children’s problem-solving competencies within a constructionist approach to ML.}

Computational thinking was integrated into the design and application of the programming subject. At the end of the semester, data were collected from 40 sophomore students in the Department of Beauty Science who answered the technology acceptance model (TAM) questionnaire and Learning Satisfactory Questionnaire after the training. An analysis was conducted using basic statistical and correlation methods, and the items demonstrated good reliability for Scratch and Tableau. The mean of 14 items in the TAM questionnaire was above 3.5 for Scratch, and that of four items was lower than 3.5 for Tableau. The mean of all the items was above 4.40 for the Learning Satisfactory Questionnaire. In the correlation analysis, the variables of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were positively related to the attitude and behavior in Scratch and Tableau. The use of visual and interactive programming pedagogies enhanced the interest of novice and non-technical students in learning technology.

However, there is still no consensus on a CT definition or how to measure it. In response, we attempt to address both issues from a psychometric approach. On the one hand, a Computational Thinking Test (CTt) is administered on a sample of 1,251 Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade, so its descriptive statistics and reliability are reported in this paper. On the second hand, the criterion validity of the CTt is studied with respect to other standardized psychological tests: the Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) battery, and the RP30 problem-solving test. Thus, it is intended to provide a new instrument for CT measurement and additionally give evidence of the nature of CT through its associations with key related psychological constructs. Results show statistically significant correlations at least moderately intense between CT and: spatial ability (r = 0.44), reasoning ability (r = 0.44), and problem-solving ability (r = 0.67). These results are consistent with recent theoretical proposals linking CT to some components of the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence, and corroborate the conceptualization of CT as a problem-solving ability.}

We present a qualitative study on robot designer intentions, conducted by group interviews with designers of two common but significantly different programmable robots, the Kubo robot and the Rugged robot. Using Activity Theory as the underlying framework for the thematic analysis of the interviews, our data reveal a large overlap of the intentions of both groups. They express the common goal of preparing children for the future although through slightly different competencies: enhancing computational thinking and 21st century skills, respectively. Both groups highlight the relevance of subjects outside computer science, specifically beyond coding. Our data also show a design process difference the Rugged robot was developed with a teacher-oriented approach whereas the Kubo robot with an object-oriented approach.}

The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context. The analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts.}

Thirty Children aged 10–11 years, from a primary school in London took part in a game-making project using the Scratch and Alice 2.4 applications for eight months. For the focus of this specific paper, data from participant observations, informal conversations, problem-solving sheets, semi-structured interviews and children’s completed games were used to make sense of elements of the computational thinking process and approaches to evaluate these elements in a computer game design context. The discussions around what CT consists, highlighted the complex structure of computational thinking and the interaction between the elements of artificial intelligence (AI), computer, cognitive, learning and psychological sciences. This also emphasised the role of metacognition in the Computational Thinking process. These arguments illustrated that it is not possible to evaluate Computational Thinking using only programming constructs, as CT process provides opportunities for developing many other skills and concepts. Therefore a multiple evaluation approach should be adopted to illustrate the full learning scope of the Computational Thinking Process. Using the support of literature review and the findings of the data analysis I proposed a multiple approach evaluation model where ‘computational concepts’, ‘metacognitive practices’, and ‘learning behaviours’ were discussed as the main elements of the CT process. Additionally, in order to investigate these dimensions within a game-making context, computer game design was also included in this evaluation model.}

However, there is little effort to develop adaptive educational computer games for promoting students' computational thinking (CT). In this study, an adaptive computer game is introduced, called AutoThinking, that not only promotes both CT skills and conceptual knowledge, but also provides adaptivity in both game-play and learning processes. To evaluate the possible effects of the game, an experimental study was carried out with 79 students in an elementary school in Estonia. AutoThinking and a conventional technology-enhanced learning approach were used for teaching CT to the experimental and control group, respectively. Our results reveal that AutoThinking improved students’ CT skills and conceptual knowledge better than the conventional approach. It was also found that students with a low and high level of prior knowledge made higher improvement in knowledge gain using the adaptive game compared to the traditional approach, especially those students with lower prior knowledge. Finally, our findings show that the adaptive game could also improve students' learning attitude toward CT better than the conventional approach, especially those students with higher prior learning attitudes.}

First, we aim to provide a systematic map of the relevant research by identifying the areas and sub-areas of CT through programming teaching and learning in higher education. Second, we aim to investigate these areas based on two dimensions: their evolution over the years and the branches to which CT is applied. For this purpose, we apply a systematic mapping methodology. Main results include the identification of the CT areas of Knowledge Base, Assessment, Learning Strategies, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building. Of these, Knowledge Base, Assessment and Tools have significantly evolved throughout the years, while Capacity Building has only recently emerged. In addition, the introduction of CT to undergraduate students and preservice teachers differs mainly in the tools used and the CT elements that are assessed. The study contributes to the field by providing a structured type of research conducted and identifying gaps and opportunities for future research.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is arising as a set of problem-solving skills that must be acquired by the new generations of students to fully understand and participate in our computer-based world. However, from a psychometric approach, we are still at an early stage regarding the definition and assessment of CT as a psychological variable. One way to advance in this area is to investigate whether ‘computationally talented’ students (i.e., ‘computational top thinkers’) can be detected even before learning to code; and, if so, how to teach them properly to fully develop their high-computational ability. This paper presents several empirical concatenated studies about the predictive validity of the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), which is administered on a sample of 314 middle school Spanish students (n=314). We report the predictive validity of the CTt, conducted at the beginning of the quarter, with respect to academic performance (Informatics, Mathematics, and Language) and learning analytics in a Code.org course collected at the end of the quarter. We also analyze the predictive validity of the CTt to early distinguish between ‘computational regular thinkers’ and ‘computational top thinkers’ (i.e., those who spontaneously accelerated from the ‘block-based’ programming environment of Code.org to the ‘text-based’ one of Khan Academy). Finally, we perform a case study over two of the students categorized as ‘computational top thinkers’, in which one of their coding products written in Processing JavaScript is described. Our results demonstrate that ‘computationally talented’ students can be detected in middle school, and that these subjects have the ability to accelerate in the Computer Science Education standards between 1 and 2 years compared to the regular learners. This could have major implications on the emerging computing curricula, which should take into account these individual differences in computational ability and ‘learning-how-to-code’ speed to ensure an appropriate progression for every student.}

The model could aid domain understanding and serve as a basis for future research studies. In addition, it could support the integration of CT into K-12 educational practices, providing evidence to educational stakeholders and researchers as well as bringing closer research, practice and policy.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) practices have gained increasing importance in primary school education. However, there are few tools to measure primary school students' CT practices that are based on rigorous psychometric approaches. This study developed an operational definition for CT practices by exploring the key dimensions of their composition and, more importantly, developed and validated a generic test tool that can effectively assess students’ CT practices. Items to measure CT practices were developed using the evidence-centered design (ECD) approach. These items prompted students to exhibit behaviors that demonstrated their skills in the four dimensions of CT practice, namely testing and debugging, algorithmic thinking, reusing and remixing, and abstracting and modularizing. A test consisting of these items was administered to 13,956 Grade 4–6 primary school students from 56 public schools in Hong Kong. The data were analyzed based on the item response theory (IRT) approach, together with other psychometric tests. A bi-factor three-parameter logistic model was ultimately adopted for test validation, as it fitted the data better than the corresponding two-parameter and one-parameter logistic models. The results validated the four-dimensional structure of the CT practices test. The reliability, test item characteristics, and CT practice abilities of students are also discussed.}

abstract = {Promoting computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in K-12 education, and the shift from visual to text-based programming is an inevitable trend in programming education. Although research on K-12 text-based programming to promote CT skills has been increasing, a literature review that systematically organizes and analyzes it has not yet emerged. Moreover, there are no uniform conclusions on how to design text-based programming activities to effectively promote students’ acquisition of CT skills. The purpose of this study was mainly to determine the effectiveness of using text-based programming to enhance K-12 students’ CT skills, to explore the effects of various text-based programming instructional design factors on CT skill acquisition, and to discuss the key issues and future development of text programming in the K-12 stage. In this study using the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative method of systematic literature review, 46 studies of text-based programming on K-12 students’ CT skills were retrieved, of which 19 empirical studies including 37 effects size met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and were therefore used as a meta-analysis. The results showed that text-based programming improved the CT skills of K-12 students overall (Hedges’ g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90], p < 0.01). No publication bias was detected. In addition, the results of the moderator analysis revealed that: 1) text programming had the greatest impact on computational thinking development in middle school students (g = 0.833, p = <0.05); 2) the duration of text programming instruction had the most significant positive impact on students' CT at 16–20 weeks (g = 1.038, p <0.05); 3) the moderating effect of different assessment tools on CT skills in text programming instruction The difference was statistically significant, and the test assessment method had a highly significant positive moderating effect on CT skills of students in grades K-12 (g = 1.005, p < 0.05); 4) The moderating effect of different student sample sizes on students' computational thinking development was significantly different, and the implementation of text-based programming instruction had the most significant effect on students' CT improvement among students with sample sizes of 41 ∼ 60 (g = 0.921, p < 0.05); 5) There were no significant differences in the effects of different text-based programming languages and learning environments on students' computational thinking.However, there are still barriers to developing instructional practices for text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students, such as the highly abstract and complex syntax of text-based programming. This study found that the most critical issues that need to be addressed in current text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students are the lack of student interest in text-based programming and the misconceptions that arise when students move from visual programming to text-based programming. To address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing student motivation and interest.

This definition highlights that CT is primarily a way of thinking and acting, which can be exhibited through the use particular skills, which then can become the basis for performance-based assessments of CT skills. Based on the literature, we categorized CT into six main facets: decomposition, abstraction, algorithm design, debugging, iteration, and generalization. This paper shows examples of CT definitions, interventions, assessments, and models across a variety of disciplines, with a call for more extensive research in this area.}

abstract = {This article explores a new but expanding research topic: primary school students’ computational thinking (CT) in the context of programming in pairs. The data comprises four fourth-grade student dyads using Scratch, a block-based programming tool, for two open-ended creative programming sessions. We sought insight into how the dyads put four intertwined CT dimensions – planning; iteration; collaboration, social interactions, and remixing; and debugging – into practice. To examine these dimensions, the data was analysed systematically in three overlapping layers: what happens on the computer screen (design events), who uses the computer (computer control), and what kind of talk is occurring (talk). The temporal viewpoint in the multi-layered analysis revealed and enriched holistic understanding of key computational and social factors, such as initial project planning methods, programming tendencies, and pair programming roles that essentially shaped the dyads’ design processes. Next to opportunities for more focal research in CT education, the results provide especially evidence-based pedagogical knowledge for supporting students’ open-ended programming in the classroom. In particular, concrete suggestions for supporting open-ended project planning, balancing between self-directed design and instructional support during programming, and promoting shared design processes in pair programming are provided based on the findings.}

This is a very exciting challenge with lots of possibilities regarding coding, robots, mobiles devices, Arduino-based application, game-based learning and so on. Thus, it is very important to explore the effect that these experiences have been taking into the pre-university students, both at primary and secondary education, with a special focus on the computational thinking as one of the components inside the toolbox to develop a reflexive and critical education in order to help children to solve problems using the technology with which they will live daily.}

From the review results, it was found that the promotion of CT in education has made great progress in the last decade. In addition to the increasing number of CT studies in different countries, the subjects, research issues, and teaching tools have also become more diverse in recent years. It was also found that CT has mainly been applied to the activities of program design and computer science, while some studies are related to other subjects. Meanwhile, most of the studies adopted Project-Based Learning, Problem-Based Learning, Cooperative Learning, and Game-based Learning in the CT activities. In other words, such activities as aesthetic experience, design-based learning, and storytelling have been relatively less frequently adopted. Most of the studies focused on programming skills training and mathematical computing, while some adopted a cross-domain teaching mode to enable students to manage and analyze materials of various domains by computing. In addition, since the cognitive ability of students of different ages varies, the CT ability cultivation methods and content criteria should vary accordingly. Moreover, most studies reported the learners' CT performance and perspectives, while their information society ability was seldom trained. Accordingly, the research trends and potential research issues of CT are proposed as a reference for researchers, instructors, and policy makers.}

The inclusion of individuals with ASD presents new perspectives, yet there is a lack of systematic evidence regarding the primary obstacles and potential benefits associated with their inclusion.
Objective:
This paper aims to identify, characterize, and describe barriers, facilitators, and methodological proposals described by the community to include individuals with ASD in the discipline of Software Engineering.
Methods:
We conducted a comprehensive systematic multivocal mapping study to evaluate the existing evidence on the inclusion of individuals with ASD in Software Engineering.
Results:
We obtained 34 primary studies from which we identified the main facilitators of motivation to learn new skills, attention to detail, and the ability to report and visualize patterns. In contrast, the main barriers detected were communication, a lack of neurodivergent computational thinking, and sensory integration. Additionally, we identified and classified four categories of proposals that allowed the inclusion of individuals with ASD: (i) using virtual reality, (ii) creating more inclusive workspaces, (iii) encouraging neurodivergent computational thinking, and (iv) improving social skills.
Conclusions:
This study identifies the principal elements that ought to be taken into consideration when allocating tasks and roles to individuals with ASD in software development.}

Even for non-computing majors, computational thinking is applicable and useful in their daily lives. The three dimensions of computational thinking are computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts. Through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. To better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. Predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data. As for the instructional implication, it is proposed that a constructionism-based problem-solving learning environment, with information processing, scaffolding and reflection activities, could be designed to foster computational practices and computational perspectives.}

In line with K-12 Computer Science Framework (k12cs.org) the term of CT refers to the “thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer”. CT is a problem solving process essential to the development of computer applications, but it is also used in supporting problem solving across many other disciplines. It has gained some grounds in secondary education in the last few years and there are ongoing efforts to introduce it to elementary education as well. Taking into consideration that algorithms play a central role in computational thinking, the aim of our research was to assess the skills of secondary school students and university students in this area, CT, that they faced an apparently computer science – free task but with obvious algorithmic background. According to the aims of our research there were two target populations: secondary school students and university students. In order to measure the level of computational thinking we elaborated a worksheet (test with problems to be solved). The tasks contained algorithms that can be applied on computer, and they did not need any IT knowledge, only structured and logical thinking. The results provide a reliable guide regarding those cognitive skills, among secondary school-children and university students, which need improvement, so transfer of knowledge could work in practical, life-like situations.}

Our research team developed the Grove-Blockly platform, a website that employs block-based programming and physical computing elements with simulations to support CT learning and IoT practices. We designed a 5-day workshop with the National Writing Project for students to engage in STEAM learning through making and creative writing. By examining students’ learning through the processes and outcomes of making, coding, and creative writing, we aim to better understand how learning occurs at the intersections of making, writing, and computing. The findings show students’ positive learning outcomes of CT and physical computing from the workshop. Mainly, students gained a deeper understanding of IoT elements (e.g., sensors, actuators) through the process of making and creative writing. This work provides empirical evidence on how students learn CT and computational practices through making and creative writing. Finally, we discuss how the engagement of STEAM practices supports and empowers students’ learning of CT and physical computing through the creation of e-crafts by students.}

Because preschool and kindergarten learners are capable of exercising their cognitive abilities to resolve basic computational logic, this demographic has raised significant interest in studying their learning intentions and behaviors. However, prior research fails to examine the effects of teaching computational logic to kindergarten children. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influences of teaching approaches in guiding preschool children to learn computational logic and programming concepts to enhance their problem-solving skills as well as computational thinking abilities. A novel teaching framework is designed to develop the learner’s cognitive abilities, which adopts the smart toy game-based learning approach along with a tangible user interface (TUI) to enhance children’s learning performance and interests. The proposed teaching approach integrates the game-based learning concepts into the TUI system, where the learning processes allow the learners to effectively practice the conceptual knowledge and efficiently advance their problem-solving skills. The results suggest using the developed game-based TUI system can increase preschool children’s learning behaviors as well as enhance their learning interests and computational thinking abilities.}

abstract = {Introducing Digital Literacy (DL), including Computational Thinking (CT), to young children develops foundational skills in computer science, problem-solving, and critical thinking. However, current digital toys for demonstrating computational thinking strategies are not always designed for early-year environments or specifically for young (preschool) children. Digital manipulatives incorporating embedded computation can offer developmentally appropriate tools to introduce foundational programming strategies and dynamic system knowledge before children become developmentally ready for more formalised programming activities. This paper presents an empirical study in a preschool environment with children (aged 3–5 years) using novel digital manipulatives, Embeddables, in child-led free and guided play activities in a preschool (Fig. 1). From our analysis of the types of activities the children engaged in, we identified underexplored design features of digital manipulatives that can build early exposure to CT skills through ludic and epistemic play. These are designed-in behaviour, distributed interactivity, conditional and proximal relations between artefacts, and abstracted multisensorial reactions.}

abstract = {Problem solving capabilities have often been reported by teachers as a key benefit from creative coding activities in school-age children. However, few studies to date have defined problem solving, and investigated how it is operationalised in interdisciplinary creative coding tasks. This study aims to build knowledge about students’ use of computational thinking and computer science concepts for problem solving when coding animated narratives. The research investigated students’ coding processes using data gathered from audio and device display recordings and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest limitations to the use of creative coding tasks if the expectation is to develop computational thinking and systematic problem solving strategies, or learn basic computer science concepts. They revealed that novice students rarely solved coding problems using optimal technically-based strategies despite being given explicit instruction on their use, opting instead to bypass problems by adjusting intended outcomes, or by using low level code translation strategies. Results demonstrate that engaging computational thinking or even demonstrating understanding of basic computer science concepts was not a requirement to produce a viable creative coding outcome. This study contributes new understanding of students’ coding practices when engaged in creative coding tasks in regular, non-specialist classrooms. Its findings challenge the commonly-held assumption that coding is a natural ‘vehicle’ to develop computational thinking and systematic approaches to problem solving. It also questions the learning that results from the non-technical, inefficient and often ineffective problem solving practices students employ during ‘creative coding’ tasks, that are frequently used by non-specialist teachers in response to curriculum requirements.}

More recently, computer video games have become widely used, particularly in secondary and tertiary education, to impart core knowledge in some subject areas and as an aid to attracting and retaining students. Academics have proposed a number of approaches, using games-based learning (GBL), to impart theoretical and applied knowledge, especially in the computer science discipline. Our research is concerned with the design of an innovative educational game framework focused on the development of Computational Thinking (CT) skills, and herein we introduce a serious game, based on our framework, which encourages the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. We describe how a limited number of key introductory computer programming concepts have been mapped onto the game-play, and how an equivalent set of skills characterising CT can be acquired through playing the game. A survey response group of 25 students, following computer science and related degree programmes but with very diverse backgrounds and experience, provided initial usability feedback on the game. Their feedback confirmed that they found the game enjoyable, and also universally believed that this approach would be beneficial in helping students learn problem-solving skills for introductory computer programming. Feedback from this group will be incorporated in a revised version of the game, which will now be subject to rigorous experimental evaluation and analysis, to provide structured empirical evidence in support of our approach.}

Although researchers have accepted that abstraction is a central concept in computational thinking, they are quick to disagree on the meaning of it. A focus on reflective abstraction has led to the development of APOS Theory in Mathematics education. This has resulted in many cases of improved student learning in Mathematics (Arnon et al., 2013). Our main aim in this paper is to construct a theoretical bridge between computational thinking and APOS Theory and show that reflective abstraction can be used in the context of computational thinking.}

However, physical educational robots are expensive, which may limit their wide use in the classroom. This study used augmented reality technology to develop a virtual educational robotic system (AR Bot for short), which offers 3D visual learning feedback to strengthen spatial ability, as well as delayed feedback and auto-scoring feedback to promote students’ deeper CT processes. To examine the impact of AR Bot on programming learning, this study used a quasi-experimental design to compare an experimental group of 41 first-year university students who used AR Bot and a control group of 34 first-year university students who used Scratch. We assessed the impact of the two CT tools on students’ internal learning processes (enjoyment of learning), CT skills (problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills), and academic achievement. The results showed that students who used AR Bot had higher enjoyment of learning, algorithm design skills, and algorithm efficiency skills but not higher problem decomposition skills and academic achievement than students who used Scratch. Enjoyment of learning led to higher problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills but not academic achievement. Problem decomposition and algorithm design skills, but not algorithm efficiency skills, led to academic achievement. The theoretical and practical implications of the proposed tool and other CT tools in programming education are discussed.}

abstract = {We believe that children as young as ten can directly benefit from opportunities to engage in computational thinking. One approach to provide these opportunities is to focus on social game play. Understanding game play is common across a range of media and ages. Children can begin by solving puzzles on paper, continue on game boards, and ultimately complete their solutions on computers. Through this process, learners can be guided through increasingly complex algorithmic thinking activities that are built from their tacit knowledge and excitement about game play. This paper describes our approach to teaching computational thinking skills without traditional programming—but instead by building on children’s existing game playing interest and skills. We built a system called CTArcade, with an initial game (Tic-Tac-Toe), which we evaluated with 18 children aged 10–15. The study shows that our particular approach helped young children to better articulate algorithmic thinking patterns, which were tacitly present when they played naturally on paper, but not explicitly apparent to them until they used the CTArcade interface.}

As the field of child–computer interaction continues to define what it means for young children to think computationally, much is unknown about the affective dimensions of children’s interactions with computers, for example how children care for materials like coding robots and how they establish social responsibility in computational environments. This paper examines these questions in the context of an early childhood coding curriculum designed to support CT in Kindergarten. Children’s talk and interactions with robots provide insight into how they were learning to care for and maintain robots when they malfunctioned. Drawing together feminist perspectives on computing, constructionism, and care, we develop a notion of a technological ethic of care and locate this in children’s early coding experiences. Through critical discourse analysis, we present two cases where groups of children interacted with each other, their teachers, and a robot called Cubetto, establishing forms of responsibility for technology. We argue that an ethic of care must be part of computational discourses in an era of climate change, where caring for technologies and keeping them in working order is key to sustainable socio-ecological relations.}

abstract = {Programming attitude has received increasing attention in programming and computational thinking (CT) education. However, at present, analysis remains scant on the correlation between students' programming attitudes and their CT skills, and less attention is paid to the influencing effects of gender and programming experience. This study first validated a newly developed programming attitudes scale (χ2/df = 2.308, RMSEA = 0.073, CFI = 0.925, TLI = 0.912) among 1180 seventh-grade students (12–13 years old). It then analyzed the relationship between students' programming attitudes and CT skills considering gender differences. Students' programming attitudes significantly predicted their CT skills. Girls have higher CT skills than boys, but their more negative programming attitudes may affect their continued skill development. Third, the relationship among programming experience, programming attitudes, and CT skills was discussed among the sample (N = 175) with programming experience, revealing that programming attitudes played an intermediary role between programming experience and CT skills. Two specific factors of programming experience (first time learning programming and programming learning duration) had differing effects on students' programming attitudes and CT skills. For programming attitudes, the grade in which students got started with programming had no effect on their programming attitudes, but programming attitudes rose with increased programming learning time. For CT, students who learned programming starting in second grade possessed the highest CT level. In addition, there is an inverted U-shaped curve between students' programming learning duration and CT skills, peaked at the fourth year of programming learning career. Implications for promoting junior high school students’ CT skills and their positive attitudes toward programming are also discussed.}

It then discusses the thinking process of algorithm selection and problem decomposition. For a given problem the programmer will typically have to select from a variety of algorithms. Some of these algorithms achieve different tradeoffs while maintaining the same numerical accuracy. Others involve sacrificing some level of accuracy to achieve much more scalable running times. For the selected algorithm, different choices of problem decomposition can result in different levels of interference between threads, parallelism exposed, load imbalance, and other performance considerations during parallel execution. Computational thinking skills allow an algorithm designer to work around the roadblocks and reach a good solution.}

abstract = {Programming is an important way to cultivate students’ computational thinking (CT) skills, which is the essential ability of students in the 21st century. As one of the mainstream forms of programming education activities, unplugged programming activities are mainly implemented in the early stage of basic education. However, considering the lack of programming experience among Chinese junior high schoolers and the uneven distribution of programming education resources, an 8-week quasi-experimental study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of unplugged activities in improving junior high schoolers’ CT skills, and to identify the influence of multiple factors. A total of 93 7th-graders volunteered to participate in the experiment: 62 students were divided into two experimental groups, which were intervened by unplugged activities to repeat the results’ reliability, and 31 students were used as the control group without any unplugged programming activities. The results of the intra-group and inter-group comparison show that unplugged programming is a more effective way to improve 7th-graders’ CT skills. Students’ mathematic performance and previous programming experience had a significant impact on their CT skills, but this impact is not reflected in the process of unplugged programming activities. It can be said that all students can develop their CT skills through unplugged programming activities, regardless of their learning background. In the current context, unplugged programming activities can be used as an effective way for junior high schoolers to improve and develop their CT skills. In addition, this paper also discusses the enlightenment to improve students’ CT skills.}

The Rasch model analysis was employed to assess differences of ability between students from the experimental group and control group. 106 Secondary One students (age 13 years old) from a secondary school in Singapore took part in this study. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent groups design was utilized where 70 students were assigned into the experimental group, and 36 students were assigned into the control group. The experimental group was given intervention with CT-infused activities both on- and off-computer, while the control group received no such intervention. Both groups were administered the pretest before the intervention and the posttest after the intervention. The data gathered were analyzed using the partial credit version of the Rasch model. Analysis of pretest and posttest results revealed that the performance of the experimental group was similar to the control group. The findings did not support the hypothesis that integrating CT in lessons can result in improved mathematics learning. However, the drastic improvement was observed in individual students from the experimental group, while there is no obvious or extreme improvement for the students from the control group. This study provides some new empirical evidence and practical contributions to the infusion of CT practices in the mathematics classroom.}

We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated “unplugged” CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (Mchange = 0.94, p < .001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (Mchange = 0.27, p = .07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (p < .01). Improvements in CT measured by TechCheck over seven weeks of the CAL-KIBO curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. Secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that CAL exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. The CT domains that showed improvement in children who received CAL-KIBO included algorithms, modularity, and representation. Young children who learned to code improved in solving unplugged problems that were not explicitly taught in the coding curriculum. This provides evidence that a developmentally appropriate curriculum for teaching young children to code can accelerate their acquisition of CT skills.}

Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) suggested that the CT perspectives instrument (n = 100) and CI instrument (n = 241) reached good fit and therefore were validated in the pilot study. In the main study, survey answers (N = 215) including CT perspectives and CI were collected.

Mediation results further revealed that ability to question can foster CI formation through ability to express, while ability to connect can directly foster CI formation. Implications were discussed at the end of the study.}

Confirmatory factor analysis validated the proposed components of the programming empowerment instrument. A structural equation model indicated that students with greater interest in programming perceived it as more meaningful, had greater impact, had greater creative self-efficacy, and had greater programming self-efficacy. Also, students with attitudes toward collaboration that were more positive than others had greater creative self-efficacy. Boys showed more interest in programming than girls did. Students in higher grade levels than others viewed programming as less meaningful and had lower programming self-efficacy.

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is broadly recognised as a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that enable their computer-mediated representation across a variety of fields. Nowadays, it is argued that CT needs to be expanded towards new pathways that establish a less individualistic and more social CT. One of these pathways consists of modifying and sharing versions of projects that other members of the community have created, but few researchers have investigated how it might be applied to primary school pupils. In this study we aimed to address the effect of a CT course on (a) primary school students’ reusing and remixing proficiency level and (b) the CT concepts they modify while they engage in reusing and remixing Scratch projects. Forty pairs of participants worked with Scratch, a block-based visual programming language, remixing projects related to stories and games. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, a rubric, and an online analytical tool, Dr. Scratch. The results of the analysis suggest that our instructional intervention, and especially game remixing activities, can improve students’ reusing and remixing proficiency; however, students modify different CT concepts when they remix stories and games.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is being consolidated as a key set of problem-solving skills that must be developed by the students to excel in our software-driven society. However, in psychological terms, CT is still a poorly defined construct, given that its nomological network has not been established yet. In a previous paper, we started to address this issue studying the correlations between CT and some fundamental cognitive variables, such as primary mental abilities and problem-solving ability. The current work deepens in the same direction as it aims to extend the nomological network of CT with non-cognitive factors, through the study of the correlations between CT, self-efficacy and the several dimensions from the ‘Big Five’ model of human personality: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and some additional self-efficacy items are administered on a sample of 1251 Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade (N = 1251), and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) is also taken by a subsample from the above (n = 99). Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and self-efficacy perception relative to CT performance (rs = 0.41), in which gender differences in favor of males are found (d = 0.42). Moreover, results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience (r = 0.41), Extraversion (r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness (r = 0.27). These findings are consistent with the existing literature except for the unexpected correlation between CT and the Extraversion factor of personality, which is consequently discussed in detail. Overall, our findings corroborate the existence of a non-cognitive side of CT that should be taken into account by educational policies and interventions aimed at fostering CT. As a final contribution, the extended nomological network of CT integrating cognitive and non-cognitive variables is depicted.}

The analysis focus on iterative acts of abstraction and decomposition as a core process that elicits development of CT. We call these iterative acts the Abstraction/Decomposition spiral (AD spiral). By illustrating the AD spiral through the actions of two first grade students, the analysis shows how visual representation of an emerging solution, and the development of a plan are two important elements when young students solve problems in a coding context, developing their CT.}

In addition, the article synthesizes findings about teachers’ views in relation to the use of coding toys in ECEC and describes the outputs that the existing literature identifies as children’s development after play activities with coding toys. The systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA-2020 statement, and the initial search across four databases (Eric, Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Research Ultimate) for papers published between January 2010 and May 2022 yielded 2672 peer-reviewed articles. Following the first evaluation, the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in a shortlist of 22 papers. The results show different strategies that the teachers can use during play activities with coding toys, assuming the roles of facilitators and mediators through collaborative work, allowing children to try and fail. Moreover, the results revealed that ECEC teachers largely hold positive and constructive attitudes towards the use of coding toys. Findings also highlight positive outcomes regarding children’s development across various cognitive and socio-emotional skills such as problem solving, computational thinking and communication. As an improvement, future studies should focus on identifying appropriate pedagogies that may be applied in tandem with the technology to maximise the pedagogical benefits for the children as well as adequate training for teachers.}

This study examines the gender divide in CIL and CT among adolescents in four European countries, highlighting the gender-based disparities in digital literacy development. Based on ICILS 2018 data, this research identifies factors contributing to gender divides in CIL and CT using regression and decomposition methods. Findings indicate that females outperform males in CIL, while males excel in CT. Gender divides decrease as the percentiles of students’ proficiency levels increase. The explained portion of the gender divide in CIL and CT is consistently smaller than the unexplained portion across countries, suggesting that gender divide or unobserved factors may drive these divides. A comparison of OLS regression results with decomposition approaches indicates that the factors influencing digital literacy development differ from those contributing to the gender divide. Variation in the factors contributing to gender divides is greater across countries than within countries for both CIL and CT. These findings highlight the need to consider national digital environments and socio-cultural contexts in addressing gender divides in digital literacy. This study offers insights for policymakers and educators to address the gender divide in digital literacy.}

The results suggest that: (a) students reach eventually the same level of CT skills development independent of their age and gender, (b) CT skills in most cases need time to fully develop (students’ scores improve significantly towards the end of the activity), (c) age and gender relevant differences appear when analysing students’ score in the various specific dimensions of the CT skills model, (d) the modality of the skill assessment instrument may have an impact on students’ performance, (e) girls appear in many situations to need more training time to reach the same skill level compared to boys.}

There is a lack of high-quality empirical research on teacher development in CT in relation to programming. This study addressed that situation by providing empirical evidence of the design and evaluation of such a teacher development program in primary schools. Seventy-six in-service teachers participated in a program comprising two 39-h courses. One course focused on the fundamental subject knowledge of programming for CT development together with pedagogy. The other focused on the development of advanced knowledge while providing opportunities to practice teaching in the classroom and to reflect on the practice. The results indicate that the participants developed a better understanding of CT concepts and practices and improved in three of the four content knowledge related dimensions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) across the two courses. The three dimensions were content knowledge of programming for CT development, technological content knowledge of the use of block-based programming environments for programming for CT development, and use of the environment to teach programming for CT development with the appropriate pedagogy in context. Analysis of the participants' self-reported reflections suggested that the two courses and the teaching experience acquired during the prolonged second course were the two main sources of improvement. This study demonstrates the importance of providing an effective teacher development program with a focus on CT concepts and practices. The program offers teachers a sustained period in which to practice in the classroom and reflect on their teaching while developing their capacity to implement CT in relation to programming.}

Computational empowerment (CE) expands computational thinking (CT) by adding a focus on empowering citizens to critically engage with technology, but currently lacks an articulation of what characterises progression towards CE. Through combining aims from computational thinking with computational empowerment, and structure progression using the SOLO taxonomy, we take the first steps towards a model for understanding and articulating progression in computational empowerment. The model has been applied in the analysis of four CE-focused research projects. Based on the analysis, we propose that computational empowerment is a matter of reaching a high competency level regarding computational concepts, computational practices and reflexivity regarding the effect of technology in one’s own life and in society. Finally, by formulating examples of learning goals, we illustrate how the model can be used by teachers and researchers to articulate, determine and compare CE learning goals, so that learning goals are aligned and complement each other from one stage to the next.}

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of partial pair programming (PPP) on elementary school students' CT skills and self-efficacy (SE). The study included four 4th grade classes, with a total of 171 students, who were taking the course entitled “Computational Thinking with Scratch” with the same teacher for one semester. Two classes (84 students) were in the Experimental Group (EG, 44 boys and 40 girls) while two other classes (87 students) were in the Control Group (CG, 45 boys and 42 girls). The students in the EG were paired up for the programming assignments while the students in the CG did the assignments on their own. The results showed that the students in the EG improved their CT skills and SE more significantly than those in the CG group. There was a low correlation between CT and SE in the post-test of both groups. The interviews with the teacher and the students afterwards provided insights in understanding the results. The findings suggest that in K-12 programming teachers could use PPP as an effective approach to improve students’ CT skills, programming SE, and beyond.}

Computer science, and especially High Performance Computing, has become a key factor in the development of many research fields, establishing a new paradigm called computational science. Researchers and professionals from many different fields require knowledge of High Performance Computing, including parallel programming, to develop fruitful and efficient work in their particular field. Therefore, at Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona (Spain), an interdisciplinary Master on “Modeling for Science and Engineering” was started 5 years ago to provide a thorough knowledge of the application of modeling and simulation to graduate students in different fields (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, etc.). In this Master’s degree, “Parallel Programming” appears as a compulsory subject because it is a key topic for them. The concepts learned in this subject must be applied to real applications. Therefore, a complementary subject on “Applied Modeling and Simulation” has also been included. It is very important to show the students how to analyze their particular problems, think about them from a computational perspective and consider the related performance issues. So, in this paper, the methodology and the experience in introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in this interdisciplinary Master’s degree are shown. This overall approach has been refined through the Master’s life, leading to excellent academic results and improving the industry and students appraisal of this programme.}

We measured their engagement and collaboration during the activity by recording their gaze, and their attitudes in relation to their learning, enjoyment, team-work and intention by post-activity survey instruments. Our analysis shows that there is a significant moderating effect of collaboration and engagement on children’s attitudes. In other words, highly engaging and collaborative coding activities significantly moderate children’s attitudes. Our findings highlight the importance of designing highly collaborative and engaging coding activities for children and quantifies how those two elements moderate children’s attitudes.}

Rather, it must offer students computational thinking (CT) practice to support their AI-related artefact creation while reducing their AI anxiety about future job replacement or sociotechnical blindness. In this study, this research explored an experiential learning approach to improve CT along with AI application capabilities when engaging undergraduate students in creating a voice assistant application (VA app). A total of 56 students participated in the study. The control group (CG) of 26 students used a conventional subject-based learning method, while the experimental group (EG) of 30 students adopted an experiential learning method. This study aimed to examine the differences in the learning achievement of CT and AI concept, as well as the perspectives of AI anxiety, and CT; in the meanwhile, this study analysed the students' learning behaviours using sequential behavioural analysis to discuss the learning process. Results showed that the CT ability of the EG was better than that of the CG, although no significant difference was found between the two groups’ AI concepts and anxiety. The behaviour analysis also revealed that the EG students were willing to ask more questions, and conducted their VA evaluation, whereas the CG students were inclined to focus on the input and output of knowledge, and replicated what the teacher presented.

This is why researchers recommend developing intervention methods adapted to classroom practice and providing explicit guidelines to teachers on integrating ER activities. The present study thus addresses this challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report students' CT competence (their performance and learning process). Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students’ CT scores. Results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for CT development in ER activities. Subject to delayed feedback, students are better at formulating the robot behaviour to be programmed, and, thus, such a strategy reinforces the anticipation process underlying the CT.}

Our review results indicate that (a) more CT assessments are needed for high school, college students, and teacher professional development programs, (b) most CT assessments focus on students' programming or computing skills, (c) traditional tests and performance assessments are often used to assess CT skills, and surveys are used to measure students’ CT dispositions, and (d) more reliability and validity evidence needs to be collected and reported in future studies.

To better understand how it can be helpful to adult learners in STEM degrees, a study was conducted on the application of two very popular commercial video games in different introductory programming courses at an online university, during the introduction of basic programming topics (CS1). The methods combined a descriptive qualitative and a quantitative approach, using a reflective journals and questionnaires, which helped students consider and express their experiences, how they interacted with the games, how the games helped them better understand the topics, and realize their personal progress and potential. Results showed that the use of these games as educational resources had a positive impact in their engagement and sense of self-efficacy, but only if some important instructional considerations are taken into account.}

abstract = {The inclusion of computational thinking (CT) in the classroom is something that the present and future society is demanding. However, this domain remains largely unexplored, especially in the first years of Primary Education. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the inclusion of the so-called unplugged activities favours the development of CT in the students of the early years of Primary Education. To this end, a quasi-experimental study has been carried out to explore the eventual benefit of a mixed approach that combines both unplugged and plugged-in activities. In particular, 84 second-grade students took part in the experiment. Three questions were evaluated: the development of their CT skills, their motivation towards the proposed instruction, and the influence of students' gender in the two previous areas. The intervention was designed on a selection of activities extracted from Code.org courses, and was divided into two phases, one in which one group worked with unplugged activities and the other with plugged-in activities, and a second where both groups worked with plugged-in activities. Analysing the three proposed questions through tests performed before, in between and after the instruction, it is concluded that the inclusion of unplugged activities in the instruction seems beneficial taking into account CT, motivation and gender.}

In addition to the overall effectiveness of the game, we investigated the impact of a specific game feature—constraints on the number of blocks in a solution. Results showed that after playing Penguin Go for less than two hours, students' CT skills improved significantly, but the additional constraints did not generate a significant impact on learning. In addition, the game overall did not influence students' attitudes toward computer science, but the constraints condition of the game negatively influenced students' attitudes toward computer science. Implications of the findings and possible directions for future research regarding using these types of games to foster computational thinking skills are discussed.}

Drawing on prior work, this study explored the evolution of two elementary school girls’ conceptions and practices of CT in science as they participated in a four-week CT-integrated science unit at a summer camp using the Dash robot and the Blockly app. Three CT concepts: loops, sequences, and conditionals, were integrated into a unit on the reproduction cycle of flowerless plants. Observations, participant drawings, and analysis of Blockly code revealed that the children improved in their CT practices. In addition, the CT-integrated science unit developed for this study successfully engaged both participants, even when one expressed a low interest in science. The study suggested that defining computing vocabulary, using checkpoint activities with immediate and corrective feedback, and scaffolding of coding concepts with unplugged activities were particularly necessary in promoting CT and the integration of CT and science education in an elementary-level informal learning context.}

All the topics of the programming unit, which are shown in the methods section, were taught to both groups for 10 weeks using the two different approaches. The change created by the implementation between the groups was tested for academic achievement, computational thinking skill efficacy perceptions, and conceptual knowledge levels. The results indicate that educational robotics develop middle school students’ academic achievement and computational thinking skill efficacy perceptions more effectively than block-based programming environments. The connections between the concepts of the students who did robotics were also found to be more solid than those who worked with block-based software.}

abstract = {As computational thinking (CT) is being embraced by educational systems worldwide, researchers and teachers have posed important questions such as “what to teach” and “what can be learned.” These questions are universally crucial to the learning of all subjects. Nevertheless, there is no up-to-date, systematic overview of CT education for K-9 students that attempt to provide answers to these crucial questions. Thus, this systematic review presents a synthesis of 55 empirical studies, providing evidence of the development of computational thinking through programming in Scratch, one of the most popular visual block programming languages in schools. The purpose of this review is to systematically examine the CT skills that can be obtained through Scratch in K-9 based on empirical evidence. This systematic review has adopted Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework as the basis for defining and identifying the expected CT skills in K-9. The major findings entail what computational thinking skills students in K-9 can learn through Scratch in relation to the framework mentioned above, taking the progression of learning into account. Additional CT skills that are not captured by the framework were identified including input/output, reading, interpreting and communicating code, using multimodal media, predictive thinking, and human-computer interaction. These additional CT skills are not currently presented in Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework and can be considered as possible supplements to their framework. Furthermore, the paper discusses the difficulties regarding assessment and the progression of the identified skills, as well as problems with study designs. Finally, the paper sets out suggestions for future studies based on the current research gaps.}

The study reports statistically significant learning gains between the initial and final assessment of children's computational thinking skills. Also, according to the findings, while both boys and girls benefited from the scaffolding techniques, a statistically significant interaction effect was detected between gender and scaffolding strategy showing that boys benefited more from the individualistic, kinesthetic, spatially-oriented, and manipulative-based activity with the cards, while girls benefited more from the collaborative writing activity. In regards to the children's problem-solving strategies during debugging, the results showed that the majority of them used decomposition as a strategy to deal with the complexity of the task. These results are important, because they show that children at this very young age are able to cope with the complexity of a learning task by decomposing it into a number of subtasks that are easier for them to tackle. The research contributes to the body of knowledge about the teaching of computational thinking. In addition, the study has practical significance for curriculum developers, instructional leaders, and classroom teachers, as they can use the results of this study to design curricula and classroom activities with a focus on the broader set of computational thinking skills, and not only coding.}

However, the integration of these fundamental skills into formal and official curriculums is still a challenge and educators needs pedagogical perspectives to properly integrate robotics, coding and computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. Thus, this study evaluates a “coding as a playground” experience in keeping with the Positive Technological Development (PTD) framework with the KIBO robotics kit, specially designed for young children. The research was conducted with preschool children aged 3–5 years old (N = 172) from three Spanish early childhood centers with different socio-economic characteristics and teachers of 16 classes. Results confirm that it is possible to start teaching this new literacy very early (at 3 years old). Furthermore, the results show that the strategies used promoted communication, collaboration and creativity in the classroom settings. The teachers also exhibited autonomy and confidence to integrate coding and computational thinking into their formal curricular activities, connecting concepts with art, music and social studies. Through the evidence found in this study, this research contributes with examples of effective strategies to introduce robotics, coding and computational thinking into early childhood classrooms.}

Debugging is a key aspect of CT and by its very nature, closely related to the idea of problem-solving since it is the process of finding and resolving bugs within programs. Moreover, participatory methods expect a high degree of activity and personal involvement of participants in the learning process. This study explores Participatory Design (PD) and Participatory Debugging (PDeb) approaches by teaching CT skills in school secondary education level through (a) designing and developing games in App Inventor, following a PD process and (b) identifying bugs/failures in the code of games, following a PDeb approach. The idea in PDeb is to make students identify issues in their code in order to solve a problem, allowing them to discover new ways and ideas for creating mobile games. For this reason, 41 students took part into this study, in a series of 6 weekly workshops. The study provides guidelines for using PD and PDeb approaches to incorporate games into computing education more effectively. We search and discuss aspects of participatory debugging used in game-design for educational purposes, together with methodological limitations and recommendations for further work in this area.}

The pedagogical foundation of CAL involves the understanding of coding as a literacy, that is, putting developmentally-appropriate powerful ideas of computer science in conversation with those taught in language arts. The paper first describes CAL and then presents results from both a pilot study and a cluster randomized controlled trial that set to evaluate CAL's feasibility and impact on students’ learning outcomes. Our findings showed that the CAL curriculum was not only feasible to implement, but also effective for improving coding skills. However, CAL's impact on computational thinking is less clear given that in the cluster randomized controlled trial, both the control and the intervention groups improved equally on a measure of computational thinking.}

The study examined the relationship among student gameplay, related classroom activity, and the development of students’ CT practices in Zoombinis classes. A combination of research methods, including educational data-mining on game data logs, cluster analysis on teacher logs of classroom activity, and multilevel modeling, was used to determine the impact of the duration and nature of student gameplay, as well as the extent and nature of classroom activity, on student CT practices. Automated detectors of gameplay CT practices built for this research were significant predictors of external post-assessment scores, and thus show promise as implicit assessments of CT practices within gameplay. Students with high duration of gameplay and high gameplay CT practices scored highest on external post-assessment of CT practices, when accounting for pre-assessment scores. This research suggests that Zoombinis is an effective CT learning tool and CT assessment tool for elementary- and middle-school students.}

The construction kit facilitates and enhances child-to-child, child-to-machine, and child-to-environment interactions through semi-structured play. It offers young students the opportunity to materialize their ideas through the construction of cyber–physical story algorithms allowing them to physically alter story segments while constructing and enhancing the storyline.

We focus on the motivations for CyberPLAYce, its participatory design, and results of an empirical study concerning CT with 8-12 year-old storytellers in a classroom setting. Results from the study suggest that cyber–physical activities afforded by CyberPLAYce cultivate engaged storytelling and CT practices in children.

The eye-gaze data were also correlated with quiz scores to test its validity in evaluating learning of CTCs. There was a statistically significant correlation between RFs on conditionals CTC and sessions showing increased frequency of regression in attention to conditionals, and between FDs and quizzes indicating FDs’ validity in measuring the learning of CTCs.

As initial evaluation, we provide some analysis of feedback from a survey response group of 25 students who have played our game as a voluntary exercise. Structured empirical evaluation will follow, and the plan for that is briefly described.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a key 21st-century skill. This paper contributes to CT research by investigating CT predictors among upper secondary students in a longitudinal and natural classroom setting. The hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: student characteristics, home environment, and learning opportunities. CT is measured with the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), an established performance test. N = 202 high-school students, at three time points over one school year, act as the sample and latent growth curve modeling as the analysis method. CT self-concept, followed by reasoning skills and gender, show the strongest association with the level of CT. Computer literacy, followed by duration of computer use and formal learning opportunities during the school year, have the strongest association with CT growth. Variables from all three areas seem to be important for predicting either CT level or growth. An explained variance of 70.4% for CT level and 61.2% for CT growth might indicate a good trade-off between the comprehensiveness and parsimony of the conceptual framework. The findings contribute to a better understanding of CT as a construct and have implications for CT instruction, e.g., the role of computer science and motivation in CT learning.}

Successful pair programming interventions necessitate mutual engagement between partners within a dyad. However, the measurement of mutual engagement in dyadic collaborative learning remains an under-researched area. This research represents a foundational stage in bridging this gap by developing a comprehensive 20-item Pair-Programming Mutual Engagement Questionnaire (PPME-Q) as a measure of mutual engagement in pair programming at the activity level. The questionnaire was validated through a sample of 86 eighth-grade students. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the existence of a four-factor structure comprising of the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement factors. The findings demonstrate the validity (χ2/df = 1.32) and reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.888) of the PPME-Q, establishing it as an effective tool for assessing eighth graders' mutual engagement in pair programming activities. As this tool is in the nascent stages of development the measurement, we emphasize the need for further empirical studies to establish criterion validity. We also discuss the implications of these findings for future research and educational practices. This targeted instrument can then potentially be adapted or scaled to other age groups based on the insights gained.}

abstract = {Background
Surgical scheduling is pivotal in managing daily surgical sequences, impacting patient experience and hospital resources significantly. With operating rooms costing approximately US $36 per minute, efficient scheduling is vital. However, global practices in surgical scheduling vary, largely due to challenges in predicting individual surgeon times for diverse patient conditions. Inspired by the Toyota Production System’s efficiency in addressing similar logistical challenges, we applied its principles as detailed in the book “Lean Thinking” by Womack and Jones, which identifies processes that do not meet customer needs as wasteful. This insight is critical in health care, where waste can compromise patient safety and medical quality.
Objective
This study aims to use lean thinking and Toyota methods to develop a more efficient surgical scheduling system that better aligns with user needs without additional financial burdens.
Methods
We implemented the 5 principles of the Toyota system: specifying value, identifying the value stream, enabling flow, establishing pull, and pursuing perfection. Value was defined in terms of meeting the customer’s needs, which in this context involved developing a responsive and efficient scheduling system. Our approach included 2 subsystems: one handling presurgery patient data and another for intraoperative and postoperative data. We identified inefficiencies in the presurgery data subsystem and responded by creating a comprehensive value stream map of the surgical process. We developed 2 Excel (Microsoft Corporation) macros using Visual Basic for Applications. The first calculated average surgery times from intra- or postoperative historic data, while the second estimated surgery durations and generated concise, visually engaging scheduling reports from presurgery data. We assessed the effectiveness of the new system by comparing task completion times and user satisfaction between the old and new systems.
Results
The implementation of the revised scheduling system significantly reduced the overall scheduling time from 301 seconds to 261 seconds (P=.02), with significant time reductions in the revised process from 99 seconds to 62 seconds (P<.001). Despite these improvements, approximately 21% of nurses preferred the older system for its familiarity. The new system protects patient data privacy and streamlines schedule dissemination through a secure LINE group (LY Corp), ensuring seamless flow. The design of the system allows for real-time updates and has been effectively monitoring surgical durations daily for over 3 years. The “pull” principle was demonstrated when an unplanned software issue prompted immediate, user-led troubleshooting, enhancing system reliability. Continuous improvement efforts are ongoing, except for the preoperative patient confirmation step, which requires further enhancement to ensure optimal patient safety.
Conclusions
Lean principles and Toyota’s methods, combined with computer programming, can revitalize surgical scheduling processes. They offer effective solutions for surgical scheduling challenges and enable the creation of a novel surgical scheduling system without incurring additional costs.}

Examples from courses in the domains of physics, chemistry, and materials science are shown to demonstrate the style and level of interactivity of typical applications. The tools presented are easy to use, and create a uniform and open environment exploitable by a large community of teachers, students, and researchers with the goal of facilitating learning and avoiding, when possible, duplication of efforts in creating teaching material.

However, on the one hand it might be complicated for teachers to develop such interactive content; on the other hand, students need to be able to access very quickly and efficiently the content, reducing the time needed to install libraries and dependencies that might differ between courses. Solution method: Here, we developed interactive web applications to complement teaching and encourage computational thinking for courses in computational physics, chemistry and materials science, using Jupyter notebooks and their rendering as interactive web applications. The latter is powered by a combination of Voila, to hide code and convert notebooks into live web applications, and (existing or custom) Jupyter widgets to enable interactiveness. The code is ready to be deployed via a number of open approaches.}

Eye tracker has portability, straightforward application, cost-effectiveness, and infant-friendly neuroimaging measures of cognitive processes such as attention, engagement, and learning. Furthermore, the ongoing software enhancements coupled with the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms have improved the precision of collecting eye movement data and simplified the calibration process. These characteristics make it plausible to consider eye-tracking technology a promising tool to assist the teaching-learning process in school routines. However, eye tracking needs to be explored more as an educational instrument for real-time classroom activities and teachers' feedback. This perspective article briefly presents the fundamentals of the eye-tracking technique and four illustrative examples of employing this method in everyday school life. The first application shows how eye tracker information may contribute to teacher assessment of students' computational thinking in coding classes. In the second and third illustrations, we discuss the additional information provided by the eye-tracker to the teacher assessing the student's strategies to solve fraction problems and chart interpretation. The last illustration demonstrates the potential of eye tracking to provide Real-time feedback on learning difficulties/disabilities. Thus, we highlight the potential of the eye tracker as a complementary tool to promote personalized education and discuss future perspectives. In conclusion, we suggest that an eye-tracking system could be helpful by providing real-time student gaze leading to immediate teacher interventions and metacognition strategies.}

However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding its influence on students' cognitive development from a multilevel perspective. This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three-level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students’ cognitive learning (i.e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education. Recommendations for future research are discussed.}

How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. Instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving miniOS kernel—a witness to the collective effort of each class. Since its inception in 2015, the miniOS pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the OS community engagement on campus. Through this initiative, we have gleaned six key insights and six lessons, which we are eager to share with the broader educational community.}

Integrating the developed tools into a unified framework is considered and the essential role of the human in the process is discussed.

Beginning with the human FDE procedure expressed in algorithmic form, mathematical and software implementations of individual steps of the algorithm are described. Advantages of the framework are discussed, including efficiency (ability to scale to tasks with many handwritten items), reproducibility and validation/improvement of existing manual procedures. It is indicated that as with other expert systems, such as for medical diagnosis, current automation tools are useful only as part of a larger manually intensive procedure. This viewpoint is illustrated with a well-known FDE case, concerning the Lindbergh kidnapping with a new hypothesis – in this case, there are multiple questioned documents, possibility of multiple writers of the same document, determining whether the writing is disguised, known writing is formal while questioned writing is informal, etc. Observations are made for future developments, where human examiners provide handwriting characteristics while computational methods provide the necessary statistical analysis.}

Despite its importance, little is known about when and how mental rotation processes are activated in games explicitly targeting spatial reasoning tasks. In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. In this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the TetrisTM game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an ACT-R based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness.}

I briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of culture—embodied versus embedded—and argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) “handles” in the environment. When schemas are “objectively adapted” to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational. To explain ecologically rational culture-in-action, I outline a formal approach to cultural learning based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learning theory. I illustrate my approach throughout with examples drawn from the sociology of science.}

abstract = {Through qualitative inquiry of a 9th-grade computer science (CS) classroom, this paper examines how teachers' pedagogical approaches can help prioritize the social and emotional dimensions of student learning to foster STEM identity and development. Findings from an ethnographic study of the delivery of the Exploring Computer Science curriculum in a high school setting of majority of students of color, and low-income youth identify five high-leverage instructional strategies. These strategies include 1) teacher mindsets towards specific subject areas like computer science; 2) creating conditions for affirming students culturally; 3) intentionally prioritizing student autonomy for social and emotional development; 4) co-constructing knowledge to increase student engagement; and 5) helping students create their own STEM identity by exposing them to STEM professionals of similar racial and cultural characteristics as students. Collectively, these practices offer critical windows into how educators can act as intermediaries in helping students see themselves in the CS field and STEM/CS career pathways. Findings from this study can inform strategies for teacher education and policy efforts seeking to close learning gaps for historically marginalized groups and to improve racial and gender diversity in opportunities for growing STEM fields.}

abstract = {Interactive marketing (IM) can be used by e-commerce businesses to provide interactive and personalised experiences to e-customers by building sustainable relationships and delivering value. Computational intelligence (CI) is the ability of a machine to learn specific tasks via data or experimental observation for understanding and analysing customer behavioural patterns. Thus, this study explores how e-customers may intend to adopt CI in e-commerce within the boundaries of IM. Using online surveys, the primary data were collected from 315 e-customers of e-commerce businesses. Subsequently, the quantitative approach was used to analyse the data. The finding reveals that using a variety of techniques such as fuzzy logic, learning theory, evolutionary computation, genetic algorithms, and deep learning, CI predicts e-customer behaviour in a changing environment. Such a prediction results in desirable impacts, including more successful IM campaigns and retention actions. Further, CI uses a computational thinking approach, including the specification of the problem, algorithmic expression, solution implementation, and solution evaluation, for the identification and classification of stock-keeping units. This allows e-customers to compare the attributes of similar products.}

The robotics project was completed over the course of fourteen weeks for 1 h each week. Gender-structured groups of all female, all male and mixed female and male were randomly assigned in each class. All groups in participating six classrooms were assigned one of three group roles implementation, which were fixed, rotating and no role. This study is significant towards identifying group scaffolds and supports that can produce benefits for all students in robotic activities. Results indicated that group roles matter when students are working on collaborative robotics projects. Three different implementations of group roles in robotics activities demonstrated an impact on robotics performance scores. Gender composition of the group did not impact groups' robotics performance. Group roles also impacted student computational thinking skills, while gender composition of the group still demonstrated no significant difference. Finally, while group roles demonstrated a difference in learning motivation towards computer programming, gender composition demonstrated no difference in learning motivation towards computer programming.}

However, the instructional practices and the degree to which key skills, such as digital literacy and computational thinking, are emphasized in classrooms vary considerably between teachers, schools, and countries. The present study was aimed at explaining this variation in the frequency of teaching practices with technology and teachers' emphasis on developing students' computer and information literacy and computational thinking by key aspects of teacher motivation and expertise, school conditions and priorities, and countries' economy and innovation. Utilizing large-scale, representative data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018 (15,015 teachers in 1195 schools in eight countries), we performed multilevel structural equation modeling and regression trees and found that teacher motivation and collaboration were positively and consistently linked to teaching practices across countries. Besides, principals' expectations concerning the teaching with technology explained variation in Finnish and German schools. In three countries, teachers' professional development was related to their teaching practices. Finally, countries’ economic development and innovation explained variation in the teacher-level effects. Our study sheds new light on the possible factors related to teaching with technology and advances the field by taking a multilevel and international perspective on these factors.}

Secondary students were particularly well-suited for comprehensive AI education due to their cognitive characteristics and developmental readiness. While most studies have focused on developing pedagogy, curriculum, and tools for secondary AI education, they have prioritized measuring students' learning outcomes over literacy development. Referring to the empirical research on secondary AI education as well as Piaget's Epistemology and Bloom's Taxonomy, this study figured out a KAT framework that constitutes AI literacy: (1) AI Knowledge (AI fundamentals, elements of AI technology, application of AI technology), (2) AI Affectivity (AI and human, AI and society), and (3) AI Thinking (engineering design thinking, computational thinking). Based on this, a 57-item AI literacy scale (AILS) was developed, and 56 items were retained after expert judgement. Then, a large sample of Chinese secondary students was surveyed, resulting in 1392 valid samples, which were randomly divided into two sub-samples: 720 samples were used for item reduction through Rasch Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis; 672 samples were used for model validation and comparison through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results indicated the AILS with three-factor structure of 48 items has a good reliability and validity. Moreover, gender differences in AI literacy among secondary students were examined. Results indicated that boys had significantly higher AI Knowledge than girls, whereas girls had significantly higher AI Affectivity than boys. The implications, limitations and future research were also discussed.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has changed lifestyles, work patterns, and educational approaches. However, courses that can guide students through the practical applications of AI technology are still scarce in K-12 education. This study aimed to develop a project-based machine learning (ML) course for the implementation of AI technology. The core idea of this course, which focused on the supervised learning of AI ML technology, was designed based on the project of weather prediction. Furthermore, data collection and status display were realized using various hardware devices such as Arduino and sensors, whereas ML algorithms were implemented in Python programming language. A total of 68 eleventh-grade senior high school students from a public school in Southern Taiwan participated in this study. The main variables included understanding AI concepts, computational thinking (CT), and learning attitude. Data were analyzed using quantitative statistics, including descriptive statistics, t-test, and analysis of covariance, supplemented with qualitative data. Based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the proposed course on the implementation of ML helps students understand the basic concepts of AI; (2) students demonstrate a significant improvement in CT skills after attending this course; (3) although the students’ attitude toward learning AI shows no significant change after attending this course, their overall view for it is positive; (4) contrary to their learning attitude, the CT skills among the students with different capabilities of learning AI are significantly dissimilar. Overall, the machine-learning implementation course developed in this study can serve as a reference for promoting AI education in the future. However, considering learners’ prior knowledge in programming, setting up appropriate learning scaffolding for them, and providing them with more examples of the applications of AI in real-life scenarios is still necessary when conducting the course for improving the students’ attitude toward AI.}

In addition, computational thinking is a critical skill for solving problems in complex systems. We conclude our study with three suggestions that help make mathematics more explicit in K–12 STEM classrooms.}

abstract = {We present a theory of the causes of difficulty in children’s creation of informal programs. Ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mAbducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mAbducer’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. Children’s errors are predictable in both their location and nature. Our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking.}

Referring to the programming knowledge, a rubric was created to analyze the data from screen recordings, observation and interviews were used together to reveal the students’ abstraction performances. The results suggested that students performed high in elimination, focusing and generalization; however, students’ performances were relatively low in customization. Students’ explanations were mostly related the nature of the problems, affordances of BBPE and the programming constructs used in coding.

We conducted this scoping review to evaluate, synthesize and display the latest literature on AI in ECE. This review analyzed 17 eligible studies conducted in different countries from 1995 to 2021. Although few studies on this critical issue have been found, the existing references provide up-to-date insights into different aspects (knowledge, tools, activities, and impacts) of AI for children. Most studies have shown that AI has significantly improved children's concepts regarding AI, machine learning, computer science, and robotics and other skills such as creativity, emotion control, collaborative inquiry, literacy skills, and computational thinking. Future directions are also discussed for researching AI in ECE.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy education mainly targets secondary and university students, often overlooking the unique needs of younger students. This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students. The research contributes by conceptualizing AI literacy and guiding policymakers and curriculum designers to implement holistic AI literacy education for young students.}

A total of 714 K-12 students in China's Zhejiang Province participated in this study and completed an online questionnaire, which included the learning engagement scale and the high-order thinking tendency scale. Cross-sectional survey data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression as a way to examine the relationship between the variables. The results showed that cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, and behavioral engagement were all key factors in developing those students' higher-order thinking for programming learning activities in K-12 students during associated activities. Furthermore, when the students' emotional engagements were elevated, the positive relationships between cognitive engagement, computational thinking, and creative thinking were closer. Inversely, when students' behavioral engagement was high, the positive relationship between cognitive engagement and critical thinking, and the positive relationship between emotional engagement and problem-solving and critical thinking became looser. These results can help deepen educators' understanding of the relationship between learning engagement and higher-order thinking skills to facilitate their search for effective strategies to improve programming instruction. Additionally, it can provide a more precise research direction for the broader development of programming education.}

There is a critical need to understand how to attract Black girls and other girls of color to the science, technology, engineering, math, and computer science (STEM+CS) field. This study aims to look at the design and implementation of a CS learning ecosystem that supports girls of color in acquiring critical CS skills starting in middle school.
Design/methodology/approach
This mixed-method case study included 53 girls, between the ages of 11 and 13, in four US middle schools. Study methods included the analysis of a pre-program student survey, longitudinal interviews and focus groups, weekly observations and computing artifacts.
Findings
Program participants were interested in CS, were confident in their ability to learn CS, had prior coding and CS experience and had parents and teachers who encouraged them to learn CS. But some students showed dependent learning behaviors while engaging in CS activities. These included relying on instructors and being reticent to make mistakes–behaviors that limit learning. The CS learning ecosystem supported students as they shifted from applying dependent learning approaches to applying independent learning approaches. Instructors sustained a growth mindset and supported productive struggle as students learned CS skills.
Originality/value
A CS learning system supported equitable learning experiences and helped students develop independent learning behaviors that led to deeper engagement in CS.}

abstract = {Advances in computational thinking and data science have led to a new era of artificial intelligence systems being engineered to adapt to complex situations and develop actionable knowledge. These learning systems are meant to reliably understand the essence of a situation and construct critical decision recommendations to support autonomous and human–machine teaming operations. In parallel, the increasing volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, and variability of data is confounding the complexity of these new systems – creating challenges in terms of their development and implementation. For artificial systems supporting critical decisions with higher consequences, safety has become an important concern. Methods are needed to avoid failure modes and ensure that only desired behavior is permitted. This paper discusses an approach that promotes self-awareness, or metacognition, within the artificial intelligence systems to understand their external and internal operational environments and use this knowledge to identify potential failures and enable self-healing and self-management for safe and desired behavior.}

However, the educational programs developed so far are designed for less than 10 sessions. This is insufficient time for students to understand artificial intelligence algorithms, utilize the learned principles of artificial intelligence, and expand by converging with various knowledge. Since the developmental characteristics of students in the lower grades of elementary school are different, it is difficult to apply them as they are. Therefore, it is necessary to study the following AI education teaching and learning methods suitable for lower grade students. In this study, we develop a teaching system design model for artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education for elementary school students in the lower grades, and based on this, design and apply an artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education program. Experiments were conducted with 47 second-year elementary school students, and students’ responses were better in the AI-based convergence education program than in general subject classes in terms of interest, understanding, and expectations for classes.}

abstract = {The technological development has raised awareness for the importance of digital competence and computational thinking (CT) to understand the digital world and has resulted in revised curricula in many countries. In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1–9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4–6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers’ knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students’ skill and ambition level.}

The review presents empirical investigations with young learners and reports on relevant frameworks and curriculum programs, effects of teaching approaches and educational tools on learning, and learning outcomes and pedagogical benefits of teaching programming. Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach. The authors conclude that future research should devote time and effort in the development of educational curricula in which the teaching of programming is fully integrated, as well as teacher training programs so that teachers become competent to teach programming in early childhood education.}

The data were analyzed using a One-way MANOVA and through correlational methods. Results show that the students’ attitudes towards robotics and STEM were positive. Gender had no effect on STEM attitudes. However, in terms of robotics attitudes, female students had significantly less desire and less confidence to learn robotics than male students. There was no gender effect on computational thinking and teamwork. Implications were discussed in terms of theoretical insights, practices for educational robotics in STEM, and directions for further research.}

abstract = {Computational thinking and coding for children are attracting increasing attention. There are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. One major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. In this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure children’s learning and activity indicators. The goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand children’s activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between children’s attitudes and their gaze. In this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. We recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. The results showed a significant relation between children’s attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). Eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted to shed additional light on children’s experience and learning duringcoding.}

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. We then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings.}

In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities.}

This paper continues the tradition of the uniform approach and proposes a small number of general mechanisms that cope with the main known effects of computing as a science — the interaction of objects-as-processes, the interaction of processes with the environment, generalized interaction. As shown, the applicative prestructure (objects-as-processes, application) generates an applicative structure (processes, application, values), which ensures the generation of the result — the value of interactions, enabling the process of evaluation. The theory of combinators is used as the main (meta)mathematical means. A diagram mechanism has been developed that implements the emerging applicative computational system of object interaction and reflects the arity of accompanying the induced information processes. The processes are bidirectional in nature, both with a decrease in arity – reduction, and with an increase in arity – expansion.}

Yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on children's cognitive development. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5 classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8 h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop), were used to assess children's skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. Such findings add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding, deepening our understanding of the positive implications of introducing Computational Thinking early in the school curriculum.}

Consequently, it is not common that students that reach higher education nowadays are familiar with CT and programming. This paper presents the development of a serious game to support the learning of basic computer programming. It is a blocks-based environment including also resources that allow the teacher to follow the student’s progress and customize in-game tasks. Four cycles of experiments were conducted, improving both the game and how it was used.

abstract = {Today it is almost impossible to spend a single day without depending on an information system, a computer or any other form of computation. Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. The open and maker philosophies behind Phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. The textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students. In this work we discuss LOGO and other projects inspired by it, and we also share the methodology and design decisions behind Phogo, the results of its application in a workshop and the improvements we are currently developing.}

abstract = {2012 and 2013 have been challenging years for Computer Science (CS) education in the UK. After decades of national neglect, there has been a sudden impetus to reintroduce CS into the 11-16 age school curriculums. Immediate obstacles include a generation of children with no CS background and an estimated need for 20,000 new CS teachers - existing UK IT teachers being insufficiently qualified and experienced. The Computing at School (CAS) movement has been instrumental in this quantum transition from an IT to Computing syllabus, as have the British Computer Society (BCS), leading UK universities and a number of major international technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, IBM, British Telecom and Facebook.This paper discusses the background to this position and the progress being made to address these challenges. It describes, in particular, the work of the BCS-funded Glyndwr University ‘Turing Project’ in introducing Welsh high-school students and staff to high-level programming and ‘computational thinking’. The Turing Project uses an innovative combination of Lego NXT Mindstorm robots, Raspberry Pi computers and PicoBoard hardware together with the Robot C and Scratch programming platforms. The paper discusses initial objectives and the general approach, describes focused delivery across different age groups and ability ranges and presents results and analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the programme. Lessons learnt and future directions are considered in conclusion.}

However, only a limited number of studies have synthesized previous quantitative studies to investigate how game-based learning (GBL) influences the enhancement of students' high-order thinking skills (HOTS) in mathematics. To address this gap, this meta-analysis study aims to investigate the effectiveness of GBL on students' mathematics HOTS. The study analyzed 40 effect sizes from 13 empirical studies published from 2010 to 2024, gathered from electronic databases such as Scopus, Eric, and Pro-Quest. R software was employed for analyzing effect sizes, detecting publication bias, and conducting subgroup analyses. Using the k-means algorithm, two studies identified as outliers were excluded. After removing these outliers, the findings revealed a positive effect of GBL on students' mathematics HOTS, with an overall effect falling within the small category (g=.134, p<.001). Additionally, moderator variables, including educational level, measured thinking skills, continent, control treatment, and intervention duration, significantly influenced the improvement of HOTS using GBL, while the sample size factor showed no significant impact. All findings, limitations, and implications are discussed in this article.
Resumen
Las tendencias de investigación educativa muestran un creciente interés en comprender el impacto de los juegos en el logro en matemáticas. Sin embargo, solo un número limitado de estudios ha sintetizado investigaciones cuantitativas previas para investigar cómo el aprendizaje basado en juegos (ABJ) influye en la mejora de las habilidades de pensamiento de alto nivel (HOTS) de los estudiantes en matemáticas. Para abordar esta brecha, se ha realizado un estudio de metaanálisis con el objetivo de investigar la efectividad del ABJ en las HOTS matemáticas de los estudiantes. El estudio ha analizado 40 tamaños de efecto de 13 estudios empíricos publicados desde 2010 hasta 2024, recopilados de bases de datos electrónicas como Scopus, Eric y Pro-Quest. Se ha empleado el software R para analizar los tamaños de efecto, detectar sesgo de publicación y realizar análisis de subgrupos. Utilizando el algoritmo k-means, se han excluido dos estudios identificados como valores atípicos. Después de eliminar estos valores atípicos, los hallazgos han revelado un efecto positivo del ABJ en las HOTS matemáticas de los estudiantes, con un efecto general situado dentro de la categoría pequeña (g=.134, p<.001). Además, se ha encontrado que variables moderadoras, incluido el nivel educativo, las habilidades de pensamiento medidas, el continente, el tratamiento de control y la duración de la intervención, han influido significativamente en la mejora de las HOTS mediante el ABJ; mientras que el factor de tamaño de la muestra no ha mostrado un impacto significativo. Se han discutido todos los hallazgos, limitaciones e implicaciones en este artículo.}

The findings showed significant positive influence on class engagement, attitudes toward mathematics, as well as student performance. The analysis also revealed gender-related variations, which affirmed the model's consistency across diverse groups. The study validated the hypothesis and consequently advocated for the transformative potential of gamification, in preparation of 21st-century learners for AI-driven digital landscape.

We draw on the concept of infrastructuring to shed light on how to create and sustain the social, material, political and organizational structures that form the basis for introducing the new national initiative. Based on our case, we distill seven propositions that describe more generally how to work strategically with this challenge.}

A project is then described involving the creation of a 3D artifact we call a Wunderlich cube — a mathematical artifact that embodies numerous spatial reasoning puzzles. An understanding of the properties of the Wunderlich cube is developed through manual construction using LEGO®, mathematical analysis, computational thinking, coding, and 3D printing.}

In this review, we attend not only to the content of the book, but also to its format as a free, online, “living” text. The book is commendable for its tight integration of technical and socio-critical aspects of computing, approachable conversational style, and collection of flexible and practical resources for teachers. It would benefit from refinement of the integration chapters and a more explicit model for how educators themselves can approach new or different CS concepts through a critical frame. Overall, we strongly recommend this book for CS Educators at all levels for its balance of depth and practicality.}

Here, we use novel analytic methods to characterize these action sequences in detail, including which individual parts of the structure (‘states’) are built and how these structures are combined, creating a fully specified build path towards the final structure. We find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. The individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths. Our approach serves as a lens into the cognitive processes underlying block building and suggests that children’s building is guided by significant cognitive constraints consistent with “computational thinking”.}

Among all factors, the social factors are often ignored by researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of two social factors (gender and partnership) on PP in a primary school setting. To that end, we conducted PP experiments in four classes from the sixth grade in a Chinese primary school. The research results indicated: (a) there was no significant difference on compatibility among the gender pairs, but a significant difference among partnership pairs; (b) there was no significant difference on programming achievement and confidence among different pairs, and girls became more productive and confidence in PP; and (c) PP tightened up the partnership within pairs. These findings suggest that teachers should take partnership into account as an important factor in PP or other collaborative learning, and adopt PP as an effective approach to decrease the gender gap in programming courses, and make students socialize.}

The aim of this study is to assess the use of a Visual Programming Language using Scratch in classroom practice, analyzing the outcomes and attitudes of 107 primary school students from 5th to 6th grade in five different schools in Spain. The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The “Computational concepts and computational practices” dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. The “Learning processes and coding in primary education” dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary education. Due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a Visual Programming Language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in primary education through a cross-curricular implementation.}

In this paper, we examine Lithuanian teachers' perceptions of the barriers and drivers to integrate the renewed Informatics curricula in primary education and the relation between them. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary school teachers, and a mixed-methods approach was employed to analyze them. The results show that explicit guidelines for renewed curricula and motivation to learn Informatics are both identified as the main barriers and drivers for integrating Informatics. The study further highlights the critical role of resources, appropriate tools, and guidelines in facilitating the successful implementation of Informatics. The study provides knowledge that could, for instance, benefit teacher training programmes and help better understand how teachers can be better supported to meet current and future challenges.}

In addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. Further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. Moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. Therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. In this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. Multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. Conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms.}

Programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using AI or other future technology. However, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. Technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients.}

Our goal is to examine differences between boys and girls using eye-tracking as an objective measure and triangulating the findings with qualitative data coming from children's interviews. The results show no statistically significant difference between female and male gaze and learning gain during the coding activity; interestingly, the qualitative data show differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding, and in perceptions about those coding activities. Our results highlight that further studies need to utilize objective measures and unveil necessary differences in the design and implementation of coding activities. Furthermore, our results provide objective evidence that female students do not lack in competences compared to boys, but simply that they have a different approach during coding activities and different perspectives about coding, an approach that needs to be cultivated and nurtured.}

Results showed three types of lesson plans, including lessons to use basic ePCR functionality to teach students lower-level CT skills, lessons to teach students basic to intermediate coding skills, and lessons to use the technology at the advanced level. Next, we applied the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and conducted a second two-step cluster analysis to identify how the technology (ePCR technology), content (math knowledge), and pedagogy (activity design) were integrated into those lesson plans. Results suggested ten clusters of lesson plans with distinct features. We summarized those ten lesson clusters into five categories: 1) ePCR technology lessons, 2) transdisciplinary problem-based learning lessons, 3) technology-assisted lessons, 4) lessons without real-world connections, and 5) lessons integrating middle-grade math learning into ePCR projects. Implications for educators and researchers were discussed at the end of the article.}

Utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (Hedges’ g‾ = 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.21]), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g‾ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.29, 0.58]) and physicality interventions (g‾ = 0.72, 95% CI [0.23, 1.21]), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (g‾s = 0.49–1.02). Moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditions—however, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through Scratch were especially effective. Our meta-analysis synthesizes the existing research evidence on the effectiveness of computer programming instruction and, ultimately, provides references with which the effects of future studies could be compared.}

The emergent design evaluation theory was used to evaluate the design and implementation of a high school biology unit integrating computational thinking and neural engineering, including teacher professional development and a web-based application. A contribution of this paper, beyond the case example it provides, is that the emergent design evaluation was combined with design-based research, a complementary approach. Consistent with the practices uniquely characteristic of emergent design evaluation, this paper describes critical points or key occasions in which aspects of the intervention influence the evaluation process, or vice versa, including the nature and direction of influence. By demonstrating the process of combining emergent design evaluation and design-based research, this paper adds to discussions within the field about how to intentionally weave together different knowledge generation approaches that both meet evaluation demands and align with the evaluation context.}

The study participants were 714 undergraduate students from various regions of Turkey selected through purposive sampling and who participated on a voluntary basis. Computational thinking, effective communication, and digital literacy scales were used and a significant correlation was found between all the 21st century skills. A series of structural equation models were tested. The final model suggests that, in line with predictions, critical thinking mediates the relationship between the 21st century skills of cooperativity, digital literacy, creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem solving. However, somewhat different from predictions is the finding that communication skills directly predict problem solving without further mediation. Thus, overall, the findings indicate that critical thinking has a crucial mediating role between other 21st century skills and problem solving.}

Students need to achieve a certain level of 3D fluency in modeling, animation, and programming to be able to create compelling 3D content. The combination of innovative end-user development tools and standards-based curriculum that promotes IT fluency by shifting the pedagogical focus from programming to design, can address motivational aspects without sacrificing principled educational goals. The AgentCubes 3D game-authoring environment raises the ceiling of end-user development without raising the threshold.

Accordingly, researchers have attempted to combine Storytelling and Robotics in education. However, no systematic record exists on this combination. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review of 82 papers out of 5272 articles published in 5 Databases in the last 20 years to map the conducted research so far. In detail: the educational levels and the school subjects in which storytelling and educational robotics are applied, the types of robots used, the duration, the sample size, participants' age and the skills that students may develop through this combination. Additionally, we analyzed, grouped, and presented the tools used for measuring the potential effects of storytelling and educational robotics. Finally, the students' role in the activities was sought. Based on our findings, most interventions mainly addressed preschool and primary school students, the robots used the most are humanoid, most interventions did not exceed 6 h, and the number of participants was less than 20 students. Besides, most interventions tried to develop students’ skills (communication, creativity, collaboration) and attitudes (engagement, motivation, participation) with qualitative tools borrowed from other domains (e.g. psychology, healthcare). This scoping demonstrates a gap in the use of storytelling and educational robotics in secondary and university education and subjects like history, geography, etc. Finally, this combination seems to have the potential to enhance the educational process, but more research is needed to shed light on all the aspects of the combination.}

For all students, there were significant increases in entity beliefs and significant decreases in incremental beliefs across the semester. However, examination of effect sizes suggests that significant findings for change across time were driven by changes in specific subpopulations of students. Moreover, results showed that students endorsed incremental belief more strongly than entity belief at both the beginning and end of the semester. Furthermore, the magnitude of changes differed based on students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profiles. Additionally, students’ achievement outcomes were weakly predicted by their implicit beliefs of intelligence. Finally, results showed that the relationship between changes in implicit intelligence beliefs and student achievement varied across different CS1 courses. Theoretical implications for implicit intelligence beliefs and recommendations for STEM educators are discussed.}

In this study, we present a supervised approach to training a deep neural network to analyze children's computational thinking (CT) captured through multimodal video data. The approach first uses a set of images extracted from video data to train the AI to map them to labels generated using a priori theory. Confusion matrices were used to establish the performance of the AI by comparing AI predictions to human analysis on a validation set of data. The findings suggested that the AI classified several aspects of children's CT in a way that was highly consistent with human analysis, demonstrating how the AI could serve as an additional team member during multimodal analysis.

abstract = {Education's evolution in the context of energy systems is essential for addressing sustainable energy challenges and developing a workforce equipped for future innovations, emphasizing both formal curricula and informal lifelong learning through successful energy case studies. As the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. Exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar-powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). Based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. The studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. The present work's main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. Energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two-objective optimization were extracted. Parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed system's performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. In addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. To find the best values of decision variables, multi-objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. The results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 $/h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 $/h). The outcomes of this work can play a critical role for higher education institutions in advancing innovative solutions to pressing energy challenges. Lifelong learning, at the heart of educational innovation, can benefit from the integration of sustainable energy systems as a core component of informal education through the optimization of ejector refrigeration systems.}

abstract = {Interest in educational robotics has increased over the last decade. Through various approaches, robots are being used in the teaching and learning of different subjects at distinct education levels. The present study investigates the effects of an educational robotic intervention on the mental rotation and computational thinking assessment in a 3rd grade classroom. To this end, we carried out a quasi-experimental study involving 24 third-grade students. From an embodied approach, we have designed a two-hour intervention providing students with a physical environment to perform tangible programming on Bee-bot. The results revealed that this educational robotic proposal aimed at map-reading tasks leads to statistically significant gains in computational thinking. Moreover, students who followed the Bee-bot-based intervention achieved greater CT level compared to students following a traditional instruction approach, after controlling student’s prior level. No conclusive results were found in relation to mental rotation.}

We collected 30 computational kits, including 13 physical kits, 8 virtual kits, and 9 hybrid kits, and performed a qualitative analysis of these kits. We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing. This qualitative study reveals the commonalities across existing kits and highlights ways for designers and researchers to expand the possibilities for children to create, explore, and play with computing.}

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess changes in young learners' attitudes toward coding: the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS). We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors. We discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners’ attitudes toward coding over time.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has led to a sudden change in education, closing schools and shifting to online teaching, which has become an enormous challenge for teachers and students. Implementing adequate online pedagogical approaches and integrating different digital tools in the teaching process have become a priority in educational systems. Finding a way to keep students' interest and persistence in learning is an important issue that online education is facing. One possible way to establish engaging and interactive learning environments, using the energy and enthusiasm of students for educational purposes, is the use of game-based learning activities and gamification of different parts of the educational process.
Objective
This paper presents a use case of migrating an escape room–style educational game to an online environment by using the design thinking methodology. We wanted to show that the design thinking methodology is useful to create engaging and motivating online games that provide educational value.
Methods
Starting from students’ perspective, we created a simple digital escape room–style game where students got an opportunity to self-assess their knowledge in computer science at their own pace. Students tested this prototype game, and their opinions about the game were collected through an online survey. The test's goal was to evaluate the students' perceptions about the implemented digital escape room–style educational game and gather information about whether it could achieve students' engagement in learning computer science during online teaching.
Results
In total, 117 students from sixth and seventh grades completed the survey regarding the achieved student engagement. Despite the differences in students’ answers about game complexity and puzzle difficulty, most students liked the activity (mean 4.75, SD 0.67, on a scale from 1 to 5). They enjoyed the game, and they would like to participate in this kind of activity again (mean 4.74, SD 0.68). All (n=117, 100%) students found the digital escape room–style educational game interesting for playing and learning.
Conclusions
The results confirmed that digital escape room–style games could be used as an educational tool to engage students in the learning process and achieve learning outcomes. Furthermore, the design thinking methodology proved to be a useful tool in the process of adding novel educational value to the digital escape room–style game.}

We suggest ways in which researchers might inform the field’s understanding of combinatorics and its potential role in curricula. We reflect on five decades of research that has been conducted since a call by Kapur (1970) for a greater focus on combinatorics in mathematics education. Specifically, we discuss the following five assertions: 1) Combinatorics is accessible, 2) Combinatorics problems provide opportunities for rich mathematical thinking, 3) Combinatorics fosters desirable mathematical practices, 4) Combinatorics can contribute positively to issues of equity in mathematics education, and 5) Combinatorics is a natural domain in which to examine and develop computational thinking and activity. Ultimately, we make a case for the valuable and unique ways in which combinatorics might effectively be leveraged within K-16 curricula.}

Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of Daisy commands, ability to play Kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. Participants improved in their knowledge of Daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and Kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. Appeal of the games was significantly related to children's learning of Daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either Daisy or Kodable learning outcomes. Results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children.}

A micro-analytic video study was conducted of primary school children designing their own technologies using existing educational microcontrollers. Our investigation reveals that the roles feedback plays in children’s interactions cannot easily be assimilated within the existing approaches to understand feedback that have been articulated in HCI literature. Our qualitative analysis shows how children do not make sense of feedback as semantic communication from the system, but make sense of it with respect to its embeddedness in a sequence of activities they are performing with the system and each other. The principal contribution to emerge from our study is a conception of feedback as a process, rather than as a semantic communicative event, nor a direct coupling of action and system response. Our discussion identifies how feedback participates in the institutional agendas of classrooms (e.g. discovery, computational thinking), and draws out initial implications for the design of feedback in educational tangible technologies, identifying possibilities for how feedback might be redesigned to better promote children’s diagnostic practices with open-ended technology kits.}

We analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. In total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 × 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. Our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) Computing Constructs as Physical Objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) Computing Processes as Motion along a Path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences. We contrast our findings to similar research in mathematics and discuss implications for computing pedagogy – namely the role of gesture in the classroom and technologies that can exploit embodied metaphors.}

keywords = {coding, medical education, undergraduate curriculum},
abstract = {Background
The ability to construct simple computer programs (coding) is being progressively recognized as a life skill. Coding is now being taught to primary-school children worldwide, but current medical students usually lack coding skills, and current measures of computer literacy for medical students focus on the use of software and internet safety. There is a need to train a cohort of doctors who can both practice medicine and engage in the development of useful, innovative technologies to increase efficiency and adapt to the modern medical world.
Objective
The aim of the study was to address the following questions: (1) is it possible to teach undergraduate medical students the basics of computer coding in a 2-day course? (2) how do students perceive the value of learning computer coding at medical school? and (3) do students see computer coding as an important skill for future doctors?
Methods
We developed a short coding course to teach self-selected cohorts of medical students basic coding. The course included a 2-day introduction on writing software, discussion of computational thinking, and how to discuss projects with mainstream computer scientists, and it was followed on by a 3-week period of self-study during which students completed a project. We explored in focus groups (FGs) whether students thought that coding has a place in the undergraduate medical curriculum.
Results
Our results demonstrate that medical students who were complete novices at coding could be taught enough to be able to create simple, usable clinical programs with 2 days of intensive teaching. In addition, 6 major themes emerged from the FGs: (1) making sense of coding, (2) developing the students’ skill set, (3) the value of coding in medicine, research, and business, (4) role of teaching coding in medical schools, (5) the concept of an enjoyable challenge, and (6) comments on the course design.
Conclusions
Medical students can acquire usable coding skills in a weekend course. They valued the teaching and identified that, as well as gaining coding skills, they had acquired an understanding of its potential both for their own projects and in health care delivery and research. They considered that coding skills teaching should be offered as an optional part of the medical curriculum.}

We designed VotestratesML, following a Constructive Design Research approach, as an ethics-first learning tool that allow students to explore implications of ML for democratic elections. Based on deployments of VotestratesML in two high school social studies classrooms, we found that safely exploring ML from a concrete starting point helped students reflect and form opinions about its use, that promoting iterative exploration through collaboration and competition motivated them to explore, and that foregrounding ethics in the design and grounding ML in a well-known subject area allowed them to engage with ML on a personal level.}

Concurrently, calls for integrating CT concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts have also increased. This is reflected by the inclusion of CT in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy. However, methods for teaching CT concepts within secondary level STEM courses vary drastically. Physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the U.S. in attempts to integrate CT within authentic STEM problem-solving contexts. Despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. A mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students’ attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. The results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and career/future use of computing concepts. Students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. Furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices. This study provides implications for improving physical computing instruction and integration within STEM education contexts.}

We present four key findings based on school visits, interviews, an electronical survey, two questionnaires, and workshops including theme discussions: (1) teachers did not perceive Technology Comprehension as a distinct subject, but rather as a set of skills that can be integrated into other subjects; (2) teachers pointed out that Technology Comprehension opens up for interdisciplinary and engaging learning activities, but they need more scaffolding and support; (3) Technology Comprehension challenges teachers’ existing competencies and there is a need for a framework that takes into account computing, design, and societal reflection as a whole; (4) Technology Comprehension appealed to various kind of students, not only those who are enthusiastic about technical matters. This study contributes to the previous research on making and digital fabrication by addressing how these endeavours are implemented on a national level through engaging with local teachers.

To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players’ qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. We provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work.}

This article presents a pedagogical framework for supporting middle schoolers to become co-designers and makers of their own machine learning applications. It presents a case study conducted in the 6th grade of a Finnish elementary school and analyzes students’ (N=34) evolving ML ideas and explanations. Data consists of a children’s artwork, students’ design ideas and co-designed applications, and structured group interviews organized at the end of the ML project. The qualitative content analysis revealed how hands-on exploration with ML-based technologies supported students in developing various kinds of design ideas that harnessed face recognition, gestures, or voice recognition for solving real-life problems. The results of the study further indicated that co-designing ML applications provided a promising entry point for students to develop their conceptual understanding of ML principles, its workflows, and its role in their everyday practices. The article concludes with a discussion on how to support students to become innovators and software designers in the age of machine learning.}

The tilt parameter is constrained by the nonlinear function f(Q) through the non-diagonal equations of the field equations. We find that the dynamics always reduce to the vacuum solutions of STEGR. This includes the Kasner universe, when no cosmological term is introduced by the f(Q) function, and the isotropic de Sitter universe, where fQ plays the role of the cosmological constant. In the extreme tilt limit, the universe is consistently anisotropic and accelerated. However, the final solution matches that of STEGR.}

To this end, this study reviewed 45 high-quality empirical studies on K-12 AI education over the past decade from both research and instruction perspectives. Regarding the research design, this study revealed the relationship between publication year, sample size, learning stage, educational setting, research method, research focus and duration. Regarding the instruction design, this study revealed the relationship between learning stage, pedagogical strategy, learning tool, learning activity, learning content, assessment method and learning effect. Besides, this study also derived recommendations for research (i.e., time allocation, samples selection, longitudinal design, rigorous methodology and technical democracy) and instruction (i.e., group learning, authentic context, teacher involvement, triangular evidence and learning scaffolding). Overall, the main findings indicate that K-12 AI education has the potential to develop students’ AI literacy, which contains AI knowledge, AI affectivity, and AI thinking. However, deficiencies in research and instructional design still remain, including short durations, small sample sizes, non-standardized research methods, lack of long-term and cross-age AI curriculum, etc. This study also discussed several critical topics for future research and instruction.}

El presente artículo presenta una propuesta de intervención para el desarrollo del pensamiento computacional en educación infantil, mediante un robot de suelo con mandos de direccionalidad programada. En el seno de la metodología observacional, se ha diseñado un sistema de observación que permite el análisis e interpretación de la conducta desplegada en el desempeño de la propuesta de intervención. La fiabilidad del sistema de observación se ha garantizado en forma de concordancia interobservadores, calculada a través del coeficiente Kappa de Cohen (1960). En el seno de la teoría de la generalizabilidad, el plan de medida [Categorías] [Steps]/ [Participantes] ha permitido constatar una elevada fiabilidad de precisión de generalización de los resultados. La operatividad del sistema de observación ha quedado reflejada en las estructuras regulares de conducta (T-patterns) detectadas -mediante el software THEME-, que han permitido caracterizar dificultades en la asimilación de un lenguaje computacional incipiente relacionadas con la capacidad de orientación espacial y la capacidad de secuenciación del niño -situaciones que implican giro y número de comandos empleados en la secuencia-.
The present work presents an intervention proposal for the development of computational thinking in early childhood education, through the use of a ground robot with programmed directional controls. Within the use of observational methodology, an observation system has been designed that allows the analysis and interpretation of the behavior displayed in the performance of the intervention proposal. The reliability of the observation system has been guaranteed in the form of inter-observer agreement, calculated using Cohen's (1960) Kappa coefficient. Within the theory of generalizability, the measurement plan [Categories] [Steps] / [Participants] has allowed to verify a high precision reliability of the generalization of the results. The operability of the observation system has been reflected in the regular behavior structures (T-patterns) detected -through the THEME software-, which have allowed characterizing difficulties in the assimilation of an incipient computational language related to the ability of spatial orientation and the sequencing capacity of children -situations involving turning and number of commands used in the sequence-.}

abstract = {In recent years, the spike in the amount of information transmitted through communication infrastructures has increased due to the advances in technologies such as cloud computing, vehicular networks systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. As a result, attackers have multiplied their efforts for the purpose of rendering network systems vulnerable. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to improve the security of those network systems. In this study, an IDS framework using Machine Learning (ML) techniques is implemented. This framework uses different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), namely, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Simple RNN. To assess the performance of the proposed IDS framework, the NSL-KDD and the UNSW-NB15 benchmark datasets are considered. Moreover, existing IDSs suffer from low test accuracy scores in detecting new attacks as the feature dimension grows. In this study, an XGBoost-based feature selection algorithm was implemented to reduce the feature space of each dataset. Following that process, 17 and 22 relevant attributes were picked from the UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD, respectively. The accuracy obtained through the test subsets was used as the main performance metric in conjunction with the F1-Score, the validation accuracy, and the training time (in seconds). The results showed that for the binary classification tasks using the NSL-KDD, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved the best performance with a test accuracy (TAC) of 88.13%, a validation accuracy (VAC) of 99.49% and a training time of 225.46 s. For the UNSW-NB15, the XGBoost-Simple-RNN was the most efficient model with a TAC of 87.07%. For the multiclass classification scheme, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved a TAC of 86.93% over the NSL-KDD and the XGBoost-GRU obtained a TAC of 78.40% over the UNSW-NB15 dataset. These results demonstrated that our proposed IDS framework performed optimally in comparison to existing methods.}

In recent years, CoSpaces has been a popular AR learning tool with an extensive library of 3D models and constructive gadgets, as well as a visual programming platform. With this tool, students can create projects of digital stories by building personalized AR artifacts, scenes, and storylines, and then share their projects in a dynamic and global community of children. This study examined the characteristics of 39 selected CoSpaces’ open projects via thematic analysis and categorization into five learning contexts: (1) art, history, culture and design, (2) STEM, (3) classroom English and everyday communication, (4) fairy tale/literature, and (5) campus tour. Furthermore, this study identified six language learning competencies derived from digital story creation: (1) discovering knowledge, (2) connecting to prior experience and knowledge, (3) conducting research, (4) problem-solving, (5) expressing and creating digitally, as well as (6) presenting, appreciating and evaluating. Digital literacy refers to the ability to use technology to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information. In addition, three major types of digital literacy skills necessary for AR digital storytelling processes have been identified, encompassing digital creativity, technoligcal proficiency, and research skills. Our results contribute to discovering educational values in developing digital language competency through AR digital story creation. Recommendations are offered for future research and for educators to design appropriate AR learning experiences.}

In this sense, neuroscientific tools such as Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Eye-tracker could be useful, allowing the investigation of relevant states experienced by students.

abstract = {We introduce mindset streams for assessing ways of bridging two target concepts in concept maps. We focus on behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMN), which map the associative and affective dimensions of memory recalls. Inspired by trains of thoughts taking several paths to link ideas, mindset streams are defined as BFMN subgraphs induced by all shortest paths between two target concepts, e.g. all recalls in shortest paths bridging “math” and “learning”. These streams quantify the following features of the mindset encoded in a BFMN: (i) semantic content (i.e. which ideas mediate connections between targets?), (ii) valence coherence/conflict (i.e. are connections mediated by entwining ideas perceived negatively, positively or neutrally?), and (iii) semantic relevance (i.e. are the bridges between targets peripheral or central for the connectivity/betweenness of the BFMN?). We investigate mindset streams between ‘maths”/“physics” and key motivational aspects of learning (“fun”, “work”, “failure”) in two BFMNs, encoding how 159 students and 59 experts perceived and associated concepts about Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM), respectively. Statistical comparisons against configuration models show that high schoolers bridge “maths” and “fun” only through overabundant levels of valence-conflicting associations, contrasting negatively perceived domain knowledge with peer-related positive experiences. This conflict is absent in the researchers’ mindset stream, which rather bridges “math” and “fun” through positive, science-related associations. The mindset streams of both groups bridge “maths” and “physics” to “work” through mostly positive career-related jargon. Students’ mindset streams of “failure” and “math”/“physics” are dominated by negative associations with test anxiety, whereas researchers integrate “failure” and “math”/“physics” in semantically richer and more positive contexts, denoting failure itself as a cornerstone of STEM learning. We discuss our findings and future research directions in view of relevant psychology/education literature.}

The focus of this research project was to examine how an elementary problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum impacted girls’ understanding of and interest in CS. By utilizing a curriculum focused on a problem that emphasized social activism, we hypothesized that PBL CS could increase interest in CS for girls. This study used a mixed-method sequential explanatory research design to examine the implementation of a CS PBL curriculum with four 6th grade teachers and their 263 students. We collected student CS knowledge pre-tests and post-tests, student attitude surveys, student focus group interviews, teacher interviews, and researcher observation reflection notes. The knowledge tests were analyzed using a mixed measures ANOVA. The survey responses were analyzed using ANOVAs and effect sizes for each comparison were calculated using partial eta squared. The qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic approach that required four researchers to come to a consensus. Results suggested that although girls had less understanding of CS at the beginning, by the end of the curriculum, girls and boys performed similarly. However, there were still elements that were not successful. Girls’ attitudes towards computer science were significantly lower than the boys at the end of the curriculum. Conceptually, the curriculum needs to specifically address how CS could impact values held by girls.}

Although this observation is generally made from the teacher's perspective, neuroscience can provide new insights by establishing the neurobiological underpinning of social interactions. This paper further develops this line of research by utilizing graph theory to represent interactions between teachers and students at the neural level. Through hyperscanning with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we collected data from the prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction of 24 dyads composed of a teacher and a student. Each dyad used a board game to perform a programming logic class that consisted of three steps: independent activities (control), presentation of concepts, and interactive exercises. Graph theory provides results regarding the strength of teacher–student interaction and the main channels involved in these interactions. We combined graph modularity and bootstrap to measure pair coactivation, thus establishing the strength of teacher–student interaction. Also, graph centrality detects the main brain channels involved during this interaction. In general, the teacher's most relevant nodes rely on the regions related to language and number processing, spatial cognition, and attention. Also, the students' most relevant nodes rely on the regions related to task management.}

The findings indicated both RF and LR performed better in Western cultures than in Eastern cultures. Furthermore, in Eastern cultures, mathematics self-efficacy for 21st-century skills played an important role in predicting resilient students’ mathematics literacy, followed by self-efficacy towards mathematics, and mathematics anxiety. In Western cultures, self-efficacy towards mathematics was the predominant predictor, followed by mathematics self-efficacy for 21st-century skills. Theoretically, this study identifies key factors in predicting resilient students’ mathematics literacy across cultures. Methodologically, it is the first to apply ML in exploring resilient students’ mathematics literacy. Practically, it guides educators interested in developing interventions to improve resilient students’ mathematics literacy.}

A quasi-experiment was conducted in a junior middle school, employing both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to explore the impact of DT on learning outcomes and mechanisms that explain the observed changes in student performance. The findings demonstrate that DT promotes creativity in students’ digital works, especially their value, diversity, and originality. DT also enhances students’ awareness of using IT to address daily challenges and facilitates their basic information knowledge and skills. Regarding the mechanisms, the DT process and tools serve as learning scaffolds and facilitate the creativity of digital work. The Ideate of DT generates ideas on what to do and how to do it. Empathize and Define establish a link between digital work and real-life problems. Prototype and Test help students acquire basic information knowledge and skills. This study not only examines the impact of DT on IT education but also explores the mechanisms to explain the observed changes in learning performance. The findings can serve as a guide for educators and researchers to further optimize the teaching of IT courses and nurture innovative talents required in the new era.}

This classification considers the role of thinking skills, which remains on periphery of current discussions about learning outcomes of entrepreneurship education.}

abstract = {In recent decades, log-based process data has been increasingly used in computer-based assessments to examine test-takers' response patterns and latent traits. This study provides a systematic review of the use of log-based process data in computer-based assessments. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline, we identified 2548 publications, of which 330 were finally included in this study after careful screening and full-text review. The results of this study can assist researchers in better understanding: (1) what are the trends in using log-based process data in computer-based assessments, (2) which process indicators have been constructed from raw log files, (3) what latent constructs have been inferred from process indicators and at what inferential levels, and (4) what are the benefits, challenges, and future recommendations for using log-based process data. By examining these questions, we conclude that the use of log-based process data in computer-based assessment shows many potentials for enhancing the assessment. Therefore, more study using log-based process data in various fields is encouraged to better understand test-takers’ underlying response processes during assessments. Additionally, there is also a considerable demand for validating process indicators and the generalizability of findings.}

The notion of granularity is developed, which allows fine-tuning the expressive possibilities of the semantic network. As known, the central issues for knowledge-based systems are what’s-in-a-node and what’s-in-a-link. As shown, the answer can be obtained from the functor-as-object representation. Then the nodes are functors, and the main links are natural transformations. Such a model is applicable to represent morphing, and the object is considered as a process, which is in a harmony with current ideas on computing. It is possible to represent information channels that carry out the transformations of processes. The possibility of generating displaced concepts and the generation of families of their morphs is shown, the evolvent of stages of knowledge and properties of the process serve as parameters.}

Child Computer Interactions a specialized area within CT, focuses on enhancing children’s physical activities, psychology, education, and communication through diverse computer applications. CCI is a steadily growing field that focuses on children as a prominent and emergent user group. This review article highlights the lack of research regarding the effective use of CCI technologies to promote cognitive development while reducing the risks linked to harmful digital content. The paper systematically examines the influence of CCI technologies on the cognitive development of children aged 0 to 12 years, addressing the research problem of inadequate filtering methods for unsafe video content that children are exposed to in today’s screen-dominated environment. It highlights how technological innovations, particularly in gaming, artificial intelligence, and media applications, are designed to enhance children’s skills while safeguarding their digital environment. A critical aspect of this review is the assessment of methods to filter and mitigate exposure to unsafe video content, a growing concern in today’s screen-dominated environment. The findings reveal that CCI programs significantly enhance children’s knowledge and skills with high accuracy. Moreover, the review underscores the importance of machine ethics in guiding the moral behavior of machines and ensuring the usability and safety of these technologies. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the role of CCI in fostering cognitive development and protecting children from inappropriate content.}

To maintain and improve students' learning motivation and interest, and more effectively carry out personalized teaching capabilities, research focuses on students' personalized knowledge structure. Starting from tracking the differences in knowledge structures among different learners, a game model based on entrepreneurial education theory has been designed. Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking. A total of 379 students participated in the experiment. The experimental results on the ASSISTments09 open data set show that the area value under the receptivity curve of this model is 0.913, which is 8.8% to 26.6% higher than that of advanced models of the same type. The performance of the research model is optimal on different training scale data. Students' adaptability to entrepreneurship education games is higher than classroom teaching, with a difference between 2% and 11%. The experimental data demonstrates the high applicability of this research method and also achieves the goal of game design, which has certain practical teaching application value.}

We had three research questions focused on children's game play: 1) How does the structure of each game influence children's play? 2) Do children play more or less independently depending on the game they play? 3) Do children who play the games more independently learn more coding skills? Three researchers coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both games, children had the same amount of independent play. Children who played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game Kodable. We discuss the ways that children play structured vs. open structured (i.e., sandbox) digital games with a particular focus on how game play may influence learning. As opportunities for individual device ownership in classrooms increase, future work should continue to explore how game features influence learning.}

Institutions were selected following purposive sampling, and those selected were randomly assigned to the Scratch programming class (experimental) and the conventional (comparison) class. A questionnaire and pre- and post-introductory programming achievement tests were used to collect data. To strengthen the research design, we used the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) algorithm to create matched samples from the unmatched data obtained from both experiments. Future studies can use these data to identify the factors influencing CS1 students' performance, investigate how programming pedagogies or tools affect CS1 students' achievements in higher education, identify important trends using machine learning techniques, and address additional research ideas.}

abstract = {In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called ‘The Hiking Optimization Algorithm’ (HOA) is proposed. HOA is inspired by hiking, a popular recreational activity, in recognition of the similarity between the search landscapes of optimization problems and the mountainous terrains traversed by hikers. HOA’s mathematical model is premised on Tobler’s Hiking Function (THF), which determines the walking velocity of hikers (i.e. agents) by considering the elevation of the terrain and the distance covered. THF is employed in determining hikers’ positions in the course of solving an optimization problem. HOA’s performance is demonstrated by benchmarking with 29 well-known test functions (including unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions), three engineering design problems (EDPs), (including I-beam, tension/compression spring, and gear train problems) and two N-P Hard problems (i.e. Traveling Salesman’s and Knapsack Problems). Moreover, HOA’s results are verified by comparison to 14 other metaheuristics, including Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) as well as newly introduced algorithms such as Komodo Mlipir Algorithm (KMA), Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO), and Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVIDOA). In this study, we employ statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon rank sum, Friedman test, and Dunn’s post hoc test for the performance evaluation. HOA’s results are competitive and, in many instances, outperform the aforementioned well-known metaheuristics.

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy education was previously taught primarily at the university and secondary school levels but has recently started to be expanded to primary school settings. When available at the primary school level, AI literacy is often taught within computer science courses, which may potentially reinforce gender stereotypes and discourage female students' engagement. In AI literacy education, the predominant teaching methods are constructivist approaches, which, while effective in fostering active learning, heavily emphasize technical skills and are therefore limited in their pedagogical scope, as they underplay other important questions, such as disinformation, data justice, and AI's ethical and societal implications. The lack of a clear definition of AI literacy for primary education also raises questions about what to teach and how to teach it. Additionally, little attention has been devoted to understanding gender differences in learning outcomes within AI literacy primary education. This study advocates the use of an arts-based transdisciplinary approach for teaching AI literacy to 25 primary school students. A pilot study utilizing mixed methods was conducted to assess the effectiveness of this arts-based approach. Quantitative analysis through a paired t-test revealed a statistically significant improvement in AI literacy among students participating in knowledge tests. Moreover, the results of the Mann‒Whitney and Kruskal‒Wallis tests indicated that gender and age did not impact pre- and post-knowledge test scores. Qualitative analyses further revealed the pedagogical benefits of the arts-based approach, demonstrating that students enhance their conceptual understanding of AI literacy by reflecting on their artifacts. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence with a small sample size that the arts-based approach can overcome age and gender barriers to accessing AI literacy education and can serve as a means to teach AI thinking.}

This analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors’ keywords. The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. We also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks. The results show that authors of ICCS papers continue to actively collaborate after the conference − on average authors collaborate with three other ICCS authors, − which suggests that ICCS is a valuable platform for collaboration development.}

Such development emerges as the result of a series of research works in the Autonomous University of Queretaro with the main purpose of improving the way in which the design of reinforced concrete structures is taught in high education institutions. CALRECOD uses optimization methods and algorithms to aid students in their design interaction learning so that they are able to compare their own designs and what commercial software delivers with optimal ones given certain load conditions on the elements or structures. The software consists almost entirely of MatLab functions (.m files) and the ACI 318-19 code is taken as their main design reference to make it internationally useful, although in some cases the Mexican code NTC-17 specifications are used. Besides MatLab functions, the software consists as well of ANSYS SpaceClaim script functions (.scscript files) as an additional tool for the aid in the visualization of design results in a 3D space in the software ANSYS SpaceClaim. CALRECOD has proven to be versatile, flexible and of easy use with a huge potential to increase learning outcomes for students in high education programs related with the design of reinforced concrete structures as well as to enhance the creation of efficient interactive environments for researchers and academics focused on the development of new design and analysis methods for such structures. With their optimization design functions, a solid comparison platform of designs’ performance could be laid out, and with its extended function design packages for structural systems, reinforced concrete design courses could be enhanced in a great deal regarding their program content’s scope.

The ability to use logical-mathematical symbols (LMS), encompassing tasks such as calculation, reasoning, and programming, is special to humans with recent emergence. LMS processing was suggested to build upon fundamental cognitive systems through neuronal recycling, with natural language processing and spatial cognition as key candidates. This study used meta-analyses and synthesized neural maps of representative LMS tasks, including reasoning, calculation, and mental programming, to compare their neural correlates with those of the two systems. Our results revealed greater activation overlap and multivariate similarity between LMS and spatial cognition than with language processing. Hierarchical clustering further indicated that LMS tasks were indistinguishable from spatial tasks at the neural level, suggesting an inherent connection. Our findings support the hypothesis that spatial cognition is the basis of LMS processing, shedding light on the logical reasoning limitations of large language models, particularly those lacking explicit spatial representations.}

In this mixed methods study, 49 fifth grade students participated in Google's CS First's Storytelling lessons focused on developing stories through coding during a school district's summer program. Fifth grade students (elementary level) completed pre- and post-writing assessments to measure 1) overall writing skills, 2) development of ideas, writing organization, grammar and usage, and mechanics, and 3) writing stamina. After completing the lessons and assessments, 10 students participated in a semi-structured interview to document perceptions of their writing abilities and engagement in writing. The results of this study show there was a significant increase in the overall scores on a pre- and post-writing assessment as well as writing stamina, and the interviews revealed that students were motivated in the storytelling process through narrative writing. The findings of this study support the implementation of coding programs as a tool for classroom instruction and the promotion of the development of writing skills for elementary students.}

abstract = {In the 21st century, the requirements for talent abilities are becoming increasingly diversified. Traditional skill learning methods cannot meet this demand, while complex learning can adapt to this demand for talent. In complex learning systems, various factors such as instructional theory, instructional interventions, and technology work together to facilitate the acquisition of complex thinking or operational skills. However, the effectiveness of instructional factors in complex skills learning remains unknown. To find out the effects of these factors on the acquisition of different complex skills, this meta-analysis includes 60 empirical studies and the effectiveness of 4C/ID model, instructional interventions and technical support on different complex learning are investigated. Complex skills learning had a moderate positive overall effect in acquiring complex skills: g = 0.67, 95% CI [0.49, 0.85]. Both thinking skills (g = 0.69, 95% CI [0.44, 0.94], k = 40) and operational skills (g = 0.64, 95% CI [0.38, 0.89], k = 20) showed moderate positive effects, and there was small but not statistically significant difference in the effect sizes between the two groups. Funnel plot, Egger's test and Rank Correlation Test results show that the findings were likely not to be affected by publication bias. We conclude that: compared to traditional learning, (1) the 4C/ID model is more suitable for thinking skills learning and has a significant large positive promotion effect. (2) Different instructional interventions can play a positive role in promoting the learning of complex skills. Learning scaffolding and learning platforms and tools are more suitable for operational skills learning, while thinking skills learning can benefit more from the adjustment of instructional models. (3) A variety of technologies can have a high effect on facilitating complex thinking and operational skills. These results show that different instructional interventions and technical support play a vital role in the learning of complex skills. In practical application, we need to make reasonable selection and application according to the specific educational situation and complex skills.}

In this scenario, new educational technology tools and immersive learning affordances (possibilities), offer unprecedented potential for the design of smart and dynamic learning systems and contexts that can enhance learning processes across varied audiences and educational settings. However, current STEAM education practice lacks attention to equipping all citizens with the necessary skills to use digital technologies in an ethical, critical and creative way. This gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. On the other hand, in its formulation STEAM as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during STEAM education design. Following an apparent need to explore ethical and inclusive design in STEAM education, and inspired in the 4E cognition framework, ethical enactivism and embodied and ecosomaesthetics experience design, here we propose a theoretical framework grounded on systems thinking for the design of smart and dynamic STEAM learning systems and settings. The framework is aimed at STEAM educational psychologists, educational technologists, learning designers and educational practitioners who wish to address the global challenges of 21st century education by means of creative, innovative and inclusive education design.}

Most participants are blinded by the abundance of digital devices and misled by the hardware and software providers who try to convince and force education systems to keep track of untraceable developments. However, recent studies have revealed that the productivity of the participants and the sustainability of their digital artifacts generate a huge but silent waste, both in terms of human and machine resources. This contradiction generates a paradox in which the illusion of digital prosperity does not allow us to clearly see the ineffectiveness of digital processes and artifacts and the losses piling up. Our research revealed that the methodology of Lean Thinking allows us to find the root causes of the problems and the revolutionary changes which must be applied to eliminate the waste generated by the participants in the digital era. It was also found that the adaptation of the lean philosophy, proven effective in production, services, and administration, can be a solution in resolving the paradox of digital education, which leads us to Lean Digital Education (LDE). Within this framework – instead of the widely accepted tool-centered ideas – we offer a human-centered, long-term thinking philosophy focusing on respect for participants, on their development, tasks, and problems, while at the same time eliminating and reducing waste. The present paper details the strength of this innovative approach which is based on (1) a solid theoretical background (2) a reliable measuring system for calculating the waste of digital activities and artifacts, (3) approaches proven to be effective and efficient in end-user data management, and (4) examples of the learning-teaching materials which support the philosophy adapted.}

Participants underwent a pretest to gauge their initial financial knowledge, engaged with the game, and completed a posttest to measure learning outcomes. Statistical analysis, including paired sample t-tests, compared pretest and posttest scores, revealing a significant enhancement in financial literacy post-gameplay. Furthermore, a questionnaire evaluated user satisfaction regarding the game, assessing metrics like enjoyment, ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Results demonstrated not only an improvement in financial knowledge but also high satisfaction among users, indicating that game-based learning can be a valuable tool for teaching financial concepts to Generation Z. These findings contribute to the understanding of game-based learning’s potential in financial education and provide insights for educators and parents.

abstract = {Summary
Data sharing in research is fraught with controversy. Academic success is premised on competitive advantage, with research teams protecting their research findings until publication. Research funders, by contrast, often require data sharing. Beyond traditional research and funding requirements, surveillance data have become contentious. Public health emergencies involving pathogens require intense genomic surveillance efforts and call for the rapid sharing of data on the basis of public interest. Under these circumstances, timely sharing of data becomes a matter of scientific integrity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the transformative potential of genomic pathogen data sharing became obvious and advanced the debate on data sharing. However, when the genomic sequencing data of the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was shared and announced by scientists in southern Africa, various challenges arose, including travel bans. The scientific, economic, and moral impact was catastrophic. Yet, travel restrictions failed to mitigate the spread of the variant already present in countries outside Africa. Public perceptions of the negative effect of data sharing are detrimental to the willingness of research participants to consent to sharing data in postpandemic research and future pandemics. Global health governance organisations have an important role in developing guidance on responsible sharing of genomic pathogen data in public health emergencies.}

It is therefore argued that students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI. This study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating AI literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical technical understanding. The results show that AI literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI). Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for technology education is suggested.}

By analyzing different channels and the (non-)unital nature of these processes, we emphasize the pivotal role of the reference state selection in determining the map's effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the considerable impact of suboptimal choices on performance, prompting a broader consideration of factors such as system dimensionality.}

In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of routine diagnostic data obtained from one diagnostic laboratory in South Africa between 2015 and 2019. During this period, samples from 275 individuals with suspected mycobacterial infection were tested using the GenoType Mycobacterium CM (Common mycobacteria) or AS (Additional species) line probe assay (LPA) (Brucker-Hain Life science, Nehren, Germany), yielding an NTM-positive result for 163 of these individuals. Interestingly, the positivity rate in respiratory samples declined from 93 % in 2015 to 79 % in 2019. Just over half of the positive samples were of respiratory origin, and the most common species identified in respiratory samples was Mycobacterium intracellulare/Mycobacteium avium complex (28.9 %), followed by M. avium (17.4 %). Where the mycobacterial species was not identified by the LPA, a higher proportion of the subsequent cultures were negative, suggestive of colonisation rather than infection. More than half of patients with a positive NTM-LPA were HIV positive (55.9 %), and this association declined slightly during the study period (62.5 %–50 %).}

In this study, the authors aim to determine whether children aged between 3 and 6 can provide creative solutions for learning difficulties in a digital environment. Moreover, the authors have identified and assessed children's behaviors that enhance their learning achievement and motivation. To achieve this, a mixed-methods case study approach was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. The "Analyzing Children's Creative Thinking" (ACCT) framework was used to investigate and identify the impact of key creative thinking skills indicators. Additionally, Motivational Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MSLQ) were used to evaluate children's perceptions and motivation in the digital STEM-based learning environment. The findings indicate that digital STEM-based learning has the potential to influence students' ability to develop creative skills and critical thinking, as well as foster positive attitudes toward learning, which may lead to deep and meaningful learning experiences. The results of psychomotor testing of children before and after playing in the STEM-based learning environment demonstrate the typical developmental profile of fine motor skills during learning for the participating children. This research may provide parents, teachers, and researchers with valuable insights, recommendations, and suggestions on how to enhance creative skills and improve learning outcomes in the digital environment.}

Still, children are often not included in this discussion, while there is much to learn from current uses and children's understandings of AI and robotics. The study is based on a seven-month ethnographical work that details the implementation of a robot in two preschool groups of children aged 1–2 and 3–5 (n = 38). The study descriptively combines a framework for children's play analysis with explorative qualitative child interviews (n = 6) with the 3-5-year-olds to examine how children play with the robot and their thinking about a future with robots and AI. The results show how children's play with robots spans all of Hughes's (2011) sixteen play types and integrates robots into play in ways specific to child-robot interaction. The interviews indicate that children have well-formed knowledge about the current uses of robots and AI and elaborate imaginaries about a future with them, including critical boundaries toward robots and AI agents. The evidence shows emerging ways children relate to these. The potential of including children's actions and voices in the ongoing societal and educational debates on AI is discussed.}

Ten articles were included in the synthesis and an overarching model was developed which depicts the themes. The results demonstrate that although students are learning to code, a range of other educational outcomes can be learnt or practiced through the teaching of coding. These included mathematical problem-solving, critical thinking, social skills, self-management and academic skills. The review also identified the importance of instructional design for developing these educational outcomes through coding.}

ANOVA results showed that the IVR configurations were systematically associated with differences in learners' visual attention on classmates or the instructional content and their overall gaze distribution in the IVR classroom (Cohen's d ranging from 0.28 to 2.04 for different IVR configurations and gaze features). Gaze-based attention on classmates was negatively related to students' interest in the IVR lesson (d = 0.28); specifically, the more boys were among the observed peers, the lower students' situational self-concept (d = 0.24). In turn, gaze-based attention on the instructional content was positively related to students' performance after the IVR lesson (d = 0.26). Implications for the future use of IVR classrooms in educational research and practice are discussed.}

It is critical to develop the next generation's AI competencies and educate them about how to work with and use AI. Previous studies on AI were predominantly focused on secondary and university education; however, research on the Artificial Intelligence curriculum in early childhood education is scarce. Due to the lack of conformity on the standardisation of AI curriculum for early childhood education, this study examines the AI curriculum for kindergarten children using the framework which consists of four key components, including (1) aims, goals, objectives, or declarations of outcome, (2) subject matter, domains, or content, (3) methods or procedure, (4) evaluation and assessment. We recommend that AI literacy be achieved by three competencies: AI Knowledge, AI Skill, and AI Attitude. The employment of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was proven to be helpful in assisting young children in grasping AI principles. We also discovered which teaching methods had the most greatest influence on students' learning. We recommend problem-based learning for future AI education based on the findings.}

However, the measurement of cytokines and chemokines in vaginal fluid samples may be influenced by a variety of factors, each with the potential to affect the sensitivity and accuracy of the assay, including the interpretation and comparison of data. We measured and compared cytokine milieu in samples collected via Softcup® menstrual cup versus vulvovaginal swabs. One hundred and eighty vulvovaginal swabs from CAPRISA 088 and 42 Softcup supernatants from CAPRISA 016 cohorts of pregnant women were used to measure the concentrations of 28 cytokines through multiplexing. Cytokines measured in this study were detectable in each of the methods however, SoftCup supernatants showed consistently, higher detectability, expression ratios, and mean concentration of cytokines than vulvovaginal swabs. While mean concentrations differed, the majority of cytokines correlated between SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swabs. Additionally, there were no significant differences in a number of participants between the two sampling methods for the classification of genital inflammation. Our findings suggest that SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swab samples are suitable for the collection of genital specimens to study biological markers of genital inflammatory response. However, the Softcup menstrual cup performs better for the detection and quantification of soluble biomarkers that are found in low concentrations in cervicovaginal fluid.}

Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11–15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to “decode the code”. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12–13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.}

It has become a subject of high significance in all perspectives, mainly in the workstation. Consequently, the main objective for universities and schools is to develop future specialists for handling the problems and finding the effective outcomes by their digital competency as a significant ability. In higher education institutions, assessing the key drivers of digital transformation is a complicated decision-making problem as the multiple factors are involved in it. To this aim, a novel picture fuzzy information-based decision-making framework is proposed to assess the key drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions. In this regard, an improved score function is proposed to rank the picture fuzzy numbers. In addition, it is used to determine the weights of decision experts. Next, some generalized Dombi aggregation operators are proposed to aggregate the picture fuzzy information. Further, an integrated criteria weighting model is presented based on the combination of objective weights through standard deviation-based model and subjective weights through pivot pairwise relative criteria importance assessment (PIPRECIA) model in the context of picture fuzzy sets. To rank the alternatives, a picture fuzzy extension of alternative ranking order model accounting for two step normalization (AROMAN) approach is proposed using the score function, Dombi operators and integrated weighting model. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated using a case study of key drivers' assessment of digital transformation in higher education institutions. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are discussed to reveal the consistency, robustness and efficiency of introduced model. This study offers a new decision-making framework, which makes a significant contribution to the key drivers’ assessment process from uncertainty perspective.}

abstract = {Quantum biology is, most simply, the investigation of quantum effects in biological systems. While all matter is fundamentally quantum, quantum biology focuses on those quantum effects that result in properties of biological scale and relevance. It has long been argued that quantum effects are incompatible with biological systems, due to the likelihood of decoherence. But nature is a surprising and enterprising engineer. In this sense, quantum biology is the study of nature's materials and how they might sustain and enhance quantum effects, even in hot and wet environments. Quantum mechanics was developed in response to seemingly anomalous interactions between light and matter. It seems fitting that a great deal of the progress made in quantum biology in the last few decades has been on the topic of photosynthesis: the interaction of light with living matter. The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter is also at the heart of many other topics of quantum biology. This review is a broad overview of the current state of this research. While the underlying quantum effects are often similar—energy and charge transfer, tunnelling, spin dynamics—the biological contexts are varied and continue to grow. These contexts include enzyme catalysis, DNA mutation, receptor binding, photosynthesis, microtubule and mitochondrial function, magnetoreception, regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species, calcium ion storage and release and, potentially, consciousness. While there remain a number of reservations regarding quantum biology, progress made in this regard might further our understanding of both quantum and biological systems. With respect to the latter, advances in understanding biology might also contribute to a better understanding of physiology and the development of new therapeutics. But quantum biology might equally advance our understanding of quantum mechanics, by illustrating what quantum effects could look like in the novel materials out of which living systems are built.}

Due to their importance, comments have been extensively studied, and much has been learned about them. These existing studies have predominantly focused on text-based languages. Conversely, block-based visual programming languages, particularly Scratch, are becoming increasingly popular. Some studies regarding comments related to the Scratch online community focus on topics such as fostering online community and engagement, sentiment analysis, etc. However, they overlook the visual aspects and the qualitative analysis of comments within code in Scratch projects. This is a meaningful limitation, and this research project studies comments and their pattern in Scratch projects from both textual and visual perspectives. We examined comments collected from different Scratch projects. Each comment was manually annotated based on textual and visual attributes, producing a taxonomy model of comments for a visual programming language. The classification results were analyzed to understand better the practice of commenting in Scratch. Our result revealed that Scratch projects produced noisier(i.e., less understandable) comments than text-based programming languages like Java. In addition, the study also revealed several limitations and shortcomings that could be addressed to improve the commenting experience in Scratch.}

Interest in robotics usage to develop such competencies in educational settings arises but there hasn't been so far mapping of the research conducted in this field. Thus, we present a scoping review of 59 articles published from 2012 to 2023 in 4 Databases and 2 Registers examining kindergarteners' skills through Educational Robotics. Our goal was to map which skills are commonly examined in kindergarten and under which terminology as well as to investigate the studies' features, the types of robotics, and the assessment tools utilized. Our findings depict that several skills are evaluated using different terms. Critical thinking is examined most frequently, creativity the least, and communication is integrated into collaboration and the opposite. Most of the researchers used the mixed method focusing on qualitative tools, examining quite a small sample size, and conducting the intervention for a short time. Also: BeeBot, Lego robotics kits (WeDo, Mindstorms), and social, humanoid robots are often used. Additionally, the evaluation tools used in the reviewed papers are presented and categorized into groups. This scoping demonstrates that robotics might affect positively the children's cognitive skills and creativity but may not facilitate their interactions so much regarding emotional expressions. Moreover, a gap in quantitative research on kindergarteners' skills development via Educational Robotics is spotted. Finally, this scoping review suggests: creating clear terms for skills, developing robotics tailored to kindergarten age, forming full robotics activities, and designing modular evaluation tools for young learners' capacities.}

abstract = {Individual investors’ decisions to switch investments very often lead to significantly lower investment returns so having an effective predictive model of these switches would be of value to clients, advisors and investment managers. A random forest algorithm was applied to a new dataset of over 20 million observations relating to 95,685 clients on Momentum Investments’ platform between 2018 and 2024. It identified a combination of investor characteristics (number of holdings, past switching behaviour, total assets) and external features (past returns, macroeconomic variables) as the key features of investor switch behaviour. This model exceeds commercially accepted standards in respect of the AUC and Gini metrics showcasing the model’s strength in its ranking capability. It can thus provide a useful basis for client segmentation and engagement by financial advisors.}

abstract = {Previous research has shown that executive functions can contribute to successful problem-solving in preschool and elementary school children. However, most studies did not simultaneously assess the role of different specific aspects of executive functions. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the individual contribution of inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility to science problem-solving performance in elementary school children. A total of 478 children from first and second grades (Mage = 7.44 years) participated in our study. They performed a Go/No-go task (inhibition), a Corsi blocks backward task (working memory), a flexible item selection task (cognitive flexibility), and three science problem-solving tasks, including two gear turning tasks and one stabilization task. Structural equation modeling showed that working memory and cognitive flexibility individually contributed to problem-solving performance, whereas inhibition did not. We conclude that maintaining task requirements and dynamic object relations (working memory) and switching between different problem-solving phases (cognitive flexibility) are essential components of successful science problem-solving in elementary school children. Inhibitory processes may be more relevant in tasks involving a higher degree of interference at the task or response level.}

abstract = {The trend of educational board games is experiencing significant growth, with notable integration of technology; however, many educators continue to use both digital and physical board games. Digital board games offer convenience, accessibility, and enhanced interactivity through features like animations, sound effects, and automated rule enforcement. In contrast, physical board games emphasize tactile engagement and face-to-face social presence, fostering a stronger sense of connection among players. This study investigates the comparative impacts of digital and non-digital board games on knowledge acquisition, social presence, and emotional reactions among higher education students. Employing a quasi-experimental design, 82 students enrolled in an Information Literacy course were divided into two groups: one using digital board games and the other using non-digital board games. Pre- and post-tests measured knowledge acquisition, while the Social Presence in Gaming Questionnaire (SPGQ) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) assessed social and emotional impacts. Results indicate that both digital and non-digital games significantly enhance knowledge acquisition, with no substantial differences between the two formats. However, digital board games showed higher engagement levels, suggesting a greater potential for promoting active participation. Emotional responses were similar across both groups, with no significant differences in positive or negative affect. These findings underscore the educational value of both game formats and highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate type based on specific educational objectives.}

abstract = {There is growing recognition among researchers and stakeholders about the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on classroom instruction. As a crucial element in developing AI literacy, AI education in K-12 schools is increasingly gaining attention. However, most existing research on K-12 AI education relies on experiential methodologies and suffers from a lack of quantitative analysis based on extensive classroom data, hindering a comprehensive depiction of AI education's current state at these educational levels. To address this gap, this article employs the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create an intelligent analysis framework that identifies learning theories, pedagogical approaches, learning tools, and levels of AI literacy in AI classroom instruction. Compared with the results of manual analysis, analysis based on LLMs can achieve more than 90% consistency. Our findings, based on the analysis of 98 classroom instruction videos in central Chinese cities, reveal that current AI classroom instruction insufficiently foster AI literacy, with only 35.71% addressing higher-level skills such as evaluating and creating AI. AI ethics are even less commonly addressed, featured in just 5.1% of classroom instruction. We classified AI classroom instruction into three categories: conceptual (50%), heuristic (18.37%), and experimental (31.63%). Correlation analysis suggests a significant relationship between the adoption of pedagogical approaches and the development of advanced AI literacy. Specifically, integrating Project-based/Problem-based learning (PBL) with Collaborative learning appears effective in cultivating the capacity to evaluate and create AI.}

abstract = {With the diversification of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the interest in their use in every segment and field of society in recent years has been increasing rapidly. One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.}

As a quantitative data collection tool, the 21st century skills scale was utilized [47]. In addition to quantitative data, qualitative data were collected from the teachers and students through semi-structured interviews. Within the scope of the research, students participated in robotic design courses with Arduino over the learning management system for ten weeks and participated in a competition with their products at the end of the activity. The activity was held with the participation of 62 students and 10 teachers. The findings of the study showed that educational robotic activities caused a significant increase in the affective domain of the students. While it did not cause any significant increase in the cognitive and sociocultural domains, the average scores of students increased on post-tests compared to the pretests for these two domains. In addition, students’ 21st century skills did not differ according to gender. Although there is no statistically significant difference in pretest–posttest results due to grade level, an increase was observed in posttest averages at each grade level. The observed increase in the post-tests, although not statistical, reveals the positive effect of educational robotic coding in terms of students’ 21st century skills. To support the results of the quantitative data, the analysis of the qualitative data revealed a consensus of both teachers and students on the contribution of such applications to the advancement of contemporary skills. In conclusion, the results of this study show that educational robotic coding can be used to develop 21st century skills of elementary school students.}

In this study, we investigated the effect of collaborative perception on cognitive engagement and learning outcomes in collaborative programming. We used a quasi-experimental research to determine the differences in cognitive engagement and learning outcomes of three groups with different levels of collaborative perception. The findings highlight several important conclusions. First, there were significant differences in cognitive engagement and learning outcomes across collaborative perception groups. Students with high levels of collaborative perception demonstrate more comprehensive and diverse cognitive engagement, resulting in higher learning outcomes compared to those with lower perception. Second, students in the low collaborative perception group had more Clarification-Elaboration cognitive connections, and students in the high collaborative perception group had stronger Clarification-Positioning and Clarification-Verification cognitive connections. Third, collaborative perception positively moderated the relationship between cognitive engagement and learning outcomes. In particular, three cognitive engagement, Clarification, Elaboration, and Positioning, had a greater impact on performance when moderated by collaborative perceptions. These findings have practical implications for educators and course designers, emphasizing the importance of considering students' collaborative perception when forming groups and promoting effective collaborative programming.}

In December 2019, COVID-19 began to appear in a few countries. By the beginning of 2020, it had spread to most countries across the world. This is when education challenges began to arise. The COVID-19 crisis led to the closure of thousands of schools and universities all over the world. Such a situation requires reliance on e-learning and robotics education for students to continue their studies to avoid the mingling between people and students. In relation to this alternative learning solution, the present study was conducted. A systematic literature review on educational robotics (ER) keywords between 2015–2020 was carried out for the purpose to review a total of 2253 articles from the selected sources; Scopus (452), Taylor & Francis (311), Science Direct (427), IEEE Xplore (221), and Web of Science (842). This review procedure was labelled as Taxonomy 1. After filtering Taxonomy 1, it was found that 98 scientific articles formed the so-called Taxonomy II that was categorized into six categories: (i) Robotics concepts, (ii) Device, (iii) Robotic applications, (iv) Manufacturing robots, (v) Robotics analysis, and (vi) Education/taxonomy. For this study, only 35 articles in this specific field were selected, of which were then assigned into three categories: (i) Application, (ii) Platform, and (iii) Educational. The results show that the application category carries 17.4%, platform 20%, and education 22.85%. This study serves as the application platform to help students, academics, and researchers.}

This paper is aimed at a wide range of primary and secondary school teachers. With 1500 teachers who participated in the online training class for programming teachers as the object in Chinese primary, middle and high school stages, mainly from the three levels of schools, teachers, and students. The questionnaire with good reliability and validity test was used as the research method, the survey data were statistically described and analyzed, and differences were analyzed using Microsoft Excel2019, SPSS26.0 and so on, it investigates and analyzes the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools. Results indicate that the overall quality of programming education offerings in elementary and secondary schools is subpar, and the construction of programming education curriculum in schools requires improvement. Nevertheless, schools prioritize improving students' comprehensive abilities, and teachers hold a positive attitude towards programming education and teaching. Although students demonstrate a strong interest in learning, their foundation is weak, resulting in poor learning outcomes. Consequently, the author provides specific recommendations regarding programming education's working mechanism, curriculum standard system, teacher training, and educational resources sharing to better develop programming education in primary and secondary schools.}

Concerns around accuracy and performance of rapid antigen tests continue to be raised with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Objective
To evaluate the performance of two widely used SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests during BA.4/BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 wave in South Africa (May – June 2022).
Study design
A prospective field evaluation compared the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test from Hangzhou AllTest Biotech (nasal swab) and the Standard Q COVID-19 Rapid Antigen test from SD Biosensor (nasopharyngeal swab) to the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (nasopharyngeal swab) on samples collected from 540 study participants.
Results
Overall 28.52% (154/540) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive with median cycle number value of 12.30 (IQR 9.30–19.40). Out of the 99 successfully sequenced SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, 18 were classified as BA.4 and 56 were classified as BA.5. The overall sensitivities of the AllTest SARS-CoV-2 Ag test and Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test were 73.38% (95% CI 65.89–79.73) and 74.03% (95% CI 66.58–80.31) and their specificities were 97.41% (95% CI 95.30–98.59) and 99.22% (95% CI 97.74–99.74) respectively. Sensitivity was >90% when the cycle number value was <20. The sensitivity of both rapid tests was >90% in samples infected with Omicron sub-lineage BA.4 and BA.5.
Conclusion
Accuracy of tested rapid antigen tests that target the nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 protein, were not adversely affected by BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a transformative force across diverse sectors worldwide, with policy initiatives signalling its rising prominence. In the realm of education, AI holds promise for revolutionising learning and teaching. However, the incorporation of AI in basic education faces significant challenges for many schools, particularly when explicit curriculum guidelines are absent, and teachers have limited exposure to AI technologies. This study delves into the importance of integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), particularly in primary and secondary school settings, with a specific emphasis on the obstacles and facilitators. The research examines the impact of digital leadership and its role in mitigating teachers' barriers to AIED incorporations. These external variables are systematically outlined within the conceptual framework proposed by this study. Furthermore, it conceptualises and considers three AIED approaches—Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI—as internal variables central to basic-education AIED incorporations, as highlighted in previous research. The study gathers quantitative data through a self-constructed questionnaire survey from 204 school principals and management-level teachers across 60 primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, capturing their perceptions of AIED incorporation. A structural equation model (SEM) is adopted to analyse the relationships between digital leadership, internal and external teacher barriers, and the three AIED approaches. The findings underscore that digital leadership is a significant factor in facilitating AI incorporations in schools, and that teachers' internal and external barriers considerably affect Learning about AI. The paper concludes by proposing strategies to enhance the capabilities of school leaders and teachers in promoting AIED in basic education.}

With the development of computer and Internet technology, gamified learning, as a new way of learning, combines the advantages of computer games and online learning, which not only meets the needs of people to learn anytime and anywhere, but also increases the fun of learning activities. In this paper, we developed a gamified learning software with traveler-type problems as the research content, through the interaction with the game, so that students can think in the game and learn knowledge through the game. Through the questionnaire for research and analysis, this game is good game fun and can stimulate learning interest well. In addition, this paper carries out an in-depth study of the game's help system, optimizes the algorithm for the help system, and proposes an improved genetic algorithm. The reverse learning method is adopted to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the optimal solution; then the Metropolis criterion is used to improve the crossover and mutation operators to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm; finally, the concept of realistic elite learning is introduced to further enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm is effectively improved in convergence performance and solution accuracy, which can significantly improve the response speed of the help system, effectively improve the game's fun, and improve the game's playability.}

Snakebite victims are commonly seen in KwaZulu-Natal Hospitals, with only a minority of patients requiring antivenom. This study reviewed antivenom-associated adverse events at our institution, after administration of the South African Vaccine Producers (SAVP) polyvalent antivenom.
Methods
A retrospective review, over 52 months (January 2016–April 2020), of patients who received antivenom. Demographics, clinical details and clinical course following antivenom administration were analysed.
Results
Emergency department doctors treated 758 snakebites; 156 patients were admitted of which 51 (33%) received antivenom. Indications for antivenom included: neurotoxicity (24%), haemotoxicity (18%) and significant cytotoxicity (58%). Antivenom-associated adverse events occurred in 61% of patients; with 47% developing anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion. There was a higher incidence of anaphylaxis in children (57%) than in adults (40%), p = 0.55. There was no association between antivenom dose and anaphylaxis. No benefit was noted with adrenaline premedication (p = 0.64), nor with the addition of antihistamine or steroid pre-medicants to adrenaline (p = 0.61). Multivariable logistic regression identified age as a predictor for anaphylaxis, but not dose or duration of antivenom and not any particular form of premedication. Intubation was required in 29% of patients developing anaphylaxis. There were no deaths and all patients made full recovery.
Conclusion
Almost half of the patients at Ngwelezana hospital in Kwazulu-Natal receiving the SAVP polyvalent antivenom developed anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion, with children at higher risk. The administration of this antivenom must only be given for valid indications, in a high-care environment by medical personnel ready to manage anaphylactic shock. The addition of antihistamine and corticosteroids to adrenaline for premedication has no added benefit.}

Computations in the natural world were present long before the invention of computers, but a remarkable shift in understanding its fundamental nature occurs, in fact, before our eyes. The present moment, in fact, is a transition from the concept of computer science as an artificial science to the understanding that information processes are abundant in nature. Computing is recognized as a natural science that studies natural and artificial information processes. In everyday computing, operations are performed on the individual generators, with little attention paid to their internal structure. However, many common operations consist of more primitive constructions connected by a combination mode. The interaction of information processes and corresponding structures is carried out in an environment of “applicative interaction”, their applications to each other, and the study of the properties of this environment allows us to understand the nature of the computations. In the present work, the main attention is paid to elucidating the technological features of computations with individual generators, or objects. Their interaction is considered in an applicative environment, which allows us to elucidate the internal structure of ordinary operations, the knowledge of which allows us to understand their properties. The choice of initial constant generators, considered as generic ones and expressed by combinators, is discussed. These initial generators are used as the main “building blocks” that occur within the larger blocks of the applicative environment in interaction with each other. As a result of the interaction, constructions arise that give representative sets of ordinary operators and embedded computing systems.}

However, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students' performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact.}

Electron surface dissipation and quantum-limited size tend to control the material properties of exterior plasmon oscillation as the size of metal nanoparticles goes into the nanoscale domain. The need to examine this characteristic behaviour and its potential becomes imperative. This study explores the effects of the damping constant of electrons and size quantum-based frequency-dependent dielectric function (FDDF) of small metallic materials using an elementary model of electrons in a confined box. The frequency-dependent dielectric function is employed to study quantum size impacts and damping constant in the optical spectra region. The quantum amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and the absorbing spectra of silver-cube geometry for different sizes by adding damping constant and without damping constant are critically examined. The findings reveal that when the damping constant effect is absent, the multiple crests emerge for the quantum-amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and absorbing spectra of the metallic materials, highlighting the electronic discretization levels in the tiny quantum-limited structure. While the damping constant is included, the multiple summits are hidden and vanish owing to a considerable widening of the structures independently. The change in the numerical results from the quantum case to the classical case for growing widths is further illustrated for both cases. The numerical results enhance our knowledge of damping constant dissipation and quantum limited-size impact in small-scaled plasmonic devices.}

abstract = {Students starting their tertiary studies in Informatics are found to have a low level of algorithmic skills and understanding of programming, which leads to the high number of drop out students and failed semesters during their studies. The students’ low level of programming skills contrasts with their excellent results in the school leaving exams. To find out the reasons for this we have launched the TAaAS project (Testing Algorithmic and Application Skills), which focuses on the students’ algorithmic skills and programming ability in traditional and non-traditional programming environments. Our analyses proved that school leaving exams are not able to measure these abilities of the students, and beyond that, are not able to distinguish between the different levels of the students. Students are accepted into the universities and start their studies based on the misleading results of the school leaving exams.}

abstract = {Purpose
Self-report of sensitive or stigmatized health states is often subject to social desirability and interviewer biases. To reduce such biases, we estimated the rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) using a list experiment.
Methods
This population-representative study was nested within the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study, a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Ukonga ward of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Men and women aged ≥40years were randomly assigned to receive a list of either four control items (i.e., the control group) or four control items plus an additional item on having had a disease through sexual contacts in the past 12months (i.e., the treatment group). We calculated the mean difference in the total number of items to which respondents answered “yes” in the treatment versus control group and compared this prevalence estimate to the one measured by the direct question.
Results
A total of 2310 adults aged ≥40years were enrolled in the study: 32% were male and 48% were aged 40–49years. The estimated prevalence of having STIs in the past 12months was 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3–23.3) in the list experiment, almost 10 times higher than the estimated prevalence of 1.8% (95%CI 1.3–2.4) based on the direct question (P < .001). STI prevalence remained high after adjusting for age, the number of lifetime sex partners, alcohol consumption and smoking in multivariate linear regression (15.6%; 95% CI 7.3–23.9).
Conclusions
We found a substantially higher prevalence of STIs among older adults in urban Tanzania when we based our estimation on a list experiment rather than a direct question in a population-representative survey. List experiments should be considered to elimnate social desirability and interviewer biases in surveys of sensitive or stigmatized health states. The very high prevalence of STIs highlights the need for improved access to STI screening, prevention and treatment for older adults in urban Africa.}

To address this issue, this study aimed to explore South Korean elementary school teachers' experiences teaching AI curricula and examine their competencies. A survey and interviews were conducted with 67 elementary school teachers who have been working in AI-leading schools in South Korea. The results indicated that teachers were least confident in content knowledge, followed by technological knowledge and pedagogical knowledge relevant to AI. Additionally, interviews with 13 teachers revealed five themes regarding AI education: (1) emphasizing the importance of instructional design in AI education; (2) redesigning the learning environment to promote learning experiences; (3) lowering teaching anxiety by acknowledging the limitations of content knowledge; (4) extending AI education based on computer science (CS) principles; and (5) acquiring literacy in codes, data, AI technologies, and ethical issues. Based on the findings, 22 AI competencies for elementary school teachers were derived and categorized based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The competencies provide a practical framework for teachers to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills for AI education. The study contributes to understanding AI teaching practices in South Korea by revealing teachers’ perspectives on and identifying the essential competencies for practicing AI education.}

We examined the effects of game types, gamification applications, pedagogical agents, programming types, and schooling levels on students' academic achievement, cognitive load, motivation, and thinking skills in programming education by cross-tabulation analysis. Results verified the positive impact of gamification in programming education. Gamification has the largest effect on students' motivation, followed by academic achievement, whereas it has the least effect on students' cognitive load. As for game types, the reasoning strategy game is most effective on academic achievement, while the puzzle game is most effective on motivation. As for gamification application, the games as a competitive mechanism has the greatest impact on students’ thinking skills and motivation. However, when games were adopted as teaching tools or student works, the effects are mainly represented in academic achievement. Pedagogical agents have a limited effect on programming education. With regard to programming types, the effect of gamification is more pronounced in text-based programming rather than graphical programming. This study provided an analytic framework and shed light on potential directions for further studies in the field.}

NetsBlox is an extension of Snap! and builds upon its visual formalism as well as its open source code base. NetsBlox adds distributed programming capabilities by introducing two well-known abstractions to block-based programming: message passing and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Messages containing data can be exchanged by two or more NetsBlox programs running on different computers connected to the Internet. RPCs are called on a client program and are executed on the NetsBlox server. These two abstractions make it possible to create distributed programs such as multi-player games or client–server applications. We believe that NetsBlox not only teaches basic distributed programming concepts but also provides increased motivation for high-school students to become creators and not just consumers of technology.}

A pre/post experimental design was carried out with 82 first-level students of the Technical University of Ambato in the careers of Systems and Electronics. The results revealed that 45% of the students increased their levels of application and analysis in programming processes. In addition, the research revealed that students who come from a background other than computer science agree with the integration of online programming tools from the first level of university entrance since this method helps to improve their learning capacity.}

As language and thoughts are intertwined and influence each other, incorporating thinking skills into English Language Teaching (ELT) can enhance academic and professional success. The prime objective of the current study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of research on Critical Thinking (CT) in ELT from 2012 to 2022 by focusing on publication and research trends such as influential authors, globally cited documents, pertinent journals, leading countries, and significant affiliations. The current study also sheds light on the co-occurrence of keywords and thematic evolution through bibliometric analysis, examining 238 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases using R studio (Biblioshiny). This bibliometric analysis highlights Thinking Skills and Creativity as the most pertinent journal with high citation count and China being the most cited country in this field. It also accentuates the interconnection between higher-order thinking skills, self-regulation, critical thinking, and critical reading. The thematic evolution of CT shows a shift from collaborative learning and CT (2012–2019) to language teaching and CT (2020–2022). It emphasizes the importance and the rising prominence of CT skills in language teaching. Moreover, this review will guide scholars and academicians to identify future research directions in the field of CT.}

Leveraging this, we extracted the emotions based upon two different theoretical frameworks from videos with children aged 13–16 while collaborating to create games using Scratch. The two sets of emotions are based on the control value theory (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise) and the education-specific expressions (frustration, boredom, confusion, delight). We computed the groups’ objective performance, which was calculated based on their created artifacts. We divided them into high and low performance and compared them based on individual emotions’ duration and the transitions among the emotions. We also used the subjective indication of their perceived performance from a self-reported questionnaire, divided them into another performance category, and did a similar analysis with the objective performance. Results show that the objective performance is better explained by the education-specific emotions and the negative valance emotions from the control value theory-based emotions. On the other hand, subjective performance is better explained by the control value theory based on emotions. Based on the results, we suggest implications both for the instructors and students.}

This paper presents a comprehensive toolkit that can help educators teach programming with an emphasis on collaboration, and provides suggestions for its effective pedagogical implementation. The toolkit comprises the Talkoo kit with physical computing plug-and-play modules and a visual programming environment. The key suggestions are inspired by the results of the evaluation studies which show that children (aged 14–18 in a sample group of 34 students) are well motivated when working with the toolkit but lack confidence in the kit’s support for collaborative learning. If the intention is to move beyond tools and code in computer education to community and context, thus encouraging computational participation, collaboration should be considered as a key aspect of physical computing activities. Our approach expands the field of programming with physical computing for teenage children with a focus on empowering teachers and students with not only a kit but also its appropriate classroom implementation for collaborative learning.}

This new user-centered paradigm — known as the NUI — aims to provide a more natural and rich experience to end users; this supports its adoption in many ubiquitous domains, as it naturally holds for Pervasive Displays: these systems are composed of variously-sized displays and support many-to-many interactions with the same public screens at the same time. Due to their public and moderated nature, users need an easy way of adapting them to heterogeneous usage contexts in order to support their long-term adoption. In this paper, we propose an End-User Development approach to this problem introducing TAPAS, a system that combines a tangible interaction with a puzzle metaphor, allowing users to create workflows on a Pervasive Display to satisfy their needs; its design and visual syntax stem from a study we carried out with designers, whose findings are also part of this work.

abstract = {At present, online education platforms are very popular. However, these platforms also have some drawbacks, including that they cannot be completely based on the needs of students, many students ignore the needs of students in order to adapt to the platform, do not adopt a more personalized learning style, and do not fully realize the individualized teaching. There are many factors at play, such as shifts in learning and teaching patterns, online platforms, hardware limitations of the network, and more. However, whether this model can finally satisfy teachers and students, and how the teaching effect is, has become a problem of concern. We propose a random forest-based method to evaluate college online courses. This method not only focuses on a single influencing factor, but also takes into account the special needs of students and teachers, and formulates different evaluation criteria, so that the system has not only universal applicability. The experimental results show that this method can improve the proficiency and level of teachers' online teaching, and can effectively combine several courses taught by students to form a personalized teaching method.}

Self-driving labs (SDLs) have recently emerged as one of the most significant technological developments in the chemical and materials sciences and hold the potential to revolutionize the research process. Herein, we discuss the structure of an SDL in terms of the hardware, the coordinator software, and the AI agent and examine how the selection of these elements affects the overall research capabilities. We further look to the application and accessibility of these platforms to better understand their future impact on synthetic and materials chemistry. With the rapid rise in the capabilities of these SDLs, and with the increasing democratization of the space, it is crucial to be aware of both the promises and pitfalls this technology holds.}

This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies. The synthesis of knowledge regarding “Why”, “What”, and “How” to do with AI education for young children informs a new way to engage children in STEM and understanding the digital world.}

Currently, most studies examine the curriculum content of the United States and the European countries. However, there has been limited research on AI learning design and activities in the Asia-Pacific region. This meta-review examined 14 research papers on AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms that were taken in the Asia-Pacific region from 2018 to 2021 by identifying the content knowledge, tools, platforms, activities, theories and models, assessment methods, and learning outcomes of the selected studies. The results indicated that AI curricula can develop students' AI knowledge and skills, learning attitudes, and interests. Furthermore, the research on AI education was conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods which are useful for future educators and researchers to understand how they assess students’ AI learning performance. We also derive a set of implications for innovative pedagogical designs in terms of educational standards, curriculum designs, formal/informal education, student learning outcomes, teacher professional development and learning progressions to recommend how governments, researchers and educators could build a widely-accepted and age-appropriate AI curriculum for all K-12 learners.}

Despite concerns about academic integrity and AI-driven misconduct, its potential to revolutionize how students engage with and master complex subjects is undeniable. This study explores the key factors that influence social science students' adoption of ChatGPT as a transformative tool to enhance their learning of data analytics. Using a descriptive quantitative research design, data were collected from a sample of 413 Omani students. The study utilizes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a guiding theoretical framework. Through ordinal logistic regression analysis, the study identifies performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, self-efficacy, and effort expectancy as significant predictors of students' decisions to adopt ChatGPT for their learning needs. Descriptive findings reveal that students highly value ChatGPT's capability to simplify complex data analytics concepts and assist in selecting appropriate analytical methods. This demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing conceptual understanding. However, the tool received lower ratings for tasks such as data pre-processing and cleaning, suggesting some limitations in its effectiveness in these aspects of data analytics learning. The study's findings highlight ChatGPT's substantial potential to enhance academic performance in data analytics and provide practical recommendations for students, instructors and institutions. The focus is on strategically integrating AI technologies to optimize instructional effectiveness and foster deeper student engagement with data analytics curricula.}

abstract = {Digital game making is becoming an increasingly common means of learning in schools due to the appeal of delivering curriculum-based learning objectives while tapping into the popularity of videogames. Indeed, research suggests that digital game making may improve cognitive and behavioral skills in learners and this may have significant impact on learners with special education needs and disabilities (SEND). However, past work in digital game making has limited involvement with learners with SEND, focuses on short-term evaluations and is utilised during extra-curricular sessions with few studies using an action-based field research approach. Furthermore, there is little quantitative data from defined methodologies that demonstrate the impact of digital game-making on learning. This paper presents results from two field trials examining the use of digital game making in two schools (one mixed ability primary and one special school) to deliver national curriculum-based content over 8-weeks. Results from a feasibility trial informed a pedagogical design and identified evaluation metrics for a subsequent longer trial. Evaluation metrics included learner engagement and collaboration with peers as suitable indicators of inclusive learning. Impact on these metrics was measured using an in-class observation tool that sampled learner behavior yielding quantitative data and follow up interviews with teachers yielding qualitative data. Results suggest that digital game making is at least as effective in encouraging engagement and collaboration in learners when compared to traditional methods, with it being more engaging for learners with special needs. Contributions from this paper provide quantifiable evidence for the perceived benefits of using digital game making and a methodology for evaluating engagement and collaboration through classroom observation. Recommendations for further work and refinements of the pedagogical implementation that builds on these findings are presented.}

There is an opportunity to compare the experiences of students in the MOOC environment in this period, particularly in terms of the difference of engagement, semantics and sentiment/stress behaviours in 2019 and 2020. In this study, we use a dataset from AdelaideX between this time period to identify the most significant features that impact student outcomes. Where previous machine learning approaches used singular features such as student interaction or sentiment in discussion forum posts, we incorporate three feature categories of engagement, semantics and sentiment/stress in an ensemble model is based on voting and stacked methods to determining the relationship between them and academic performance. From our results, we discover that sentiment/stress played little part in academic performance and was relatively unchanged in online courses in this dataset between 2019 and 2020. We present two individual student cases to further contextualise our findings.}

Our objective is to assess ChatGPT’s capabilities in two different programming languages, namely C++ and Java, by providing it with a set of programming problem, encompassing various types and difficulty levels. We focus on evaluating ChatGPT’s performance in terms of code correctness, run-time efficiency, and memory usage. The experimental results show that, while ChatGPT is good at solving easy and medium programming problems written in C++ and Java, it encounters some difficulties with more complicated tasks in the two languages. Compared to code written by humans, the one generated by ChatGPT is of lower quality, with respect to runtime and memory usage.}

To evaluate the current state of the literature on AI literacy in higher and adult education, a scoping literature review was conducted with the objective of identifying thematic foci and recent research trends. Ten research databases were searched and out of 902 initial records, 30 studies were identified using predefined eligibility criteria, whereof the content was evaluated in the review. The results indicated that research in this area is still in its infancy and needs refinement in terms of how to define AI literacy in adult education as well as what content should be taught to non-experts.

Spatial visualization is closely related to mathematics achievement, but little is known about how these skills link to task success. We examined middle school students’ representations and solutions to area problems (both non-metric and metric) through qualitative and quantitative task analysis. Task solutions were analyzed as a function of spatial visualization skills and links were made between student solutions on tasks with different goals (i.e., non-metric and metric). Findings suggest that strong spatial visualizers solved the tasks with relative ease, with evidence for conceptual and procedural understanding. By contrast, Low and Average Spatial students more frequently produced errors due to failure to correctly determine linear measurements or apply appropriate formula, despite adequate procedural knowledge. A novel finding was the facilitating role of spatial skills in the link between metric task representation and success in determining a solution. From a teaching and learning perspective, these results highlight the need to connect emergent spatial skills with mathematical content and support students to develop conceptual understanding in parallel with procedural competence.}

These predictors include credits earned in math and science courses as well as ACT math scores. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of U.S. young adults who were 12th graders in 2004 and disclosed their college majors by 2006, logistic regression analyses revealed that students who took more units in computer science courses were significantly more likely to choose STEM majors in both 4-year and 2-year postsecondary institutions. Moreover, regardless of the type of postsecondary institutions that students attended, taking more units in computer science courses played a significant role in choosing STEM majors. In addition, the effects of computer science education on student STEM major selection were equally as strong as the effects of math and science education. The results suggest that promoting the quality of computer science education is just as important in motivating students to pursue STEM education and career choices at the secondary level as are math and science education.}

Italy was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, experiencing multiple waves of infection following the sequential emergence of new variants. Understanding the transmission patterns and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is vital for future preparedness.
Methods
We conducted an analysis of viral genome sequences, integrating epidemiological and phylodynamic approaches, to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 variants have spread within the country.
Results
Our findings indicate bidirectional international transmission, with Italy transitioning between importing and exporting the virus. Italy experienced four distinct epidemic waves, each associated with a significant reduction in fatalities from 2021 to 2023. These waves were primarily driven by the emergence of VOCs such as Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, which were reflected in observed transmission dynamics and effectiveness of public health measures.
Conclusions
The changing patterns of viral spread and variant prevalence throughout Italy's pandemic response underscore the continued importance of flexible public health strategies and genomic surveillance, both of which are crucial for tracking the evolution of variants and adapting control measures effectively to ensure preparedness for future outbreaks.}

However, a clear and unified understanding of entrepreneurial thinking, particularly within engineering education, remains lacking. This study aims to develop a comprehensive definition of entrepreneurial thinking suitable for integration into engineering curricula. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eleven participants, including entrepreneurs, academicians, and product designers from diverse fields, such as product design, textile, ergonomics, finance, biomedical engineering, computer science, and mechanical engineering. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically keyword extraction and topic modeling with Latent Semantic Indexing, we analyzed the interview transcripts to identify key terms and themes. From this analysis, we extracted the top 50 words and identified the top 20 topics related to entrepreneurial thinking. Brainstorming sessions with product designers were then held to construct definitions based on these findings. Through majority and relationship analysis, we derived a unified definition of entrepreneurial thinking. The final definition was compared with variations of definitions prepared by undergraduate design students, revealing that students had a vague understanding of the concept. To address this gap, we proposed a framework that integrates the developed definition with engineering course elements using the Lean Canvas Model. This framework aligns engineering education with entrepreneurial skills without adding a significant workload, serving as a practical tool for educators. This study provides a unified definition of entrepreneurial thinking and offers a practical framework for its integration into engineering education, thereby fostering an entrepreneurial mindset among future engineers.}

To date, little is known about reference frames used by young children in toy-based coding. Video recordings of 16 children engaging in two programming tasks were collected. Results from an analysis of 240 min of video data indicate that young children engage in shifts of reference frames when learning to program, however, young children do not have a precise coordination system. The present study proposes two additional reference frames, ProtoEgocentric and ProtoAllocentric, that allow for the consideration of developmental imprecision in children. The most common reference frame shift observed was ProtoAllocentric to ProtoEgocentric, which accounted for 47.4% of all shifts across sites and contexts. Three cases are presented to illustrate reference frame shifts and how children’s developmental imprecision affects their experience.}

Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for beer ranged from 0.04 to 6 µg/L and 0.1–19 µg/L respectively. LOD and LOQ for gin ranged from 0.02 to 2.3 µg/L and 0.05–7.5 µg/L respectively. In addition, the stability of selected terpenoids (as class representatives) was assessed in a synthetic beer using a targeted and non-targeted approach at various temperatures (4, 25 and 50C) over 40 days. The optimized method was successfully applied to commercial craft beers (n = 34) and gins (n = 21). The main contributors to the beer profile were β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, linalool, α-terpineol, citronellol, and geraniol, and for gin 1,8-cineole, cis-rose oxide, linalool, α-terpineol, valencene, and citronellol. This first report of such a large number of terpenoids determined in one run and quantified using authentic standards can make a significant contribution to the knowledge of products that require a fast and accurate terpenoid screening method.}

It is therefore important to understand how ready teachers are to teach the emerging subject as the success of AI education would probably be closely dependent on the readiness of teachers. As a result, this study presents an insight into factors influencing the behavioural intention and readiness of Nigerian in-service teachers to teach artificial intelligence. A total of 368 teachers, from elementary to high school participated in the study. We utilised quantitative methodology using variance-based structural equation modelling to understand the relationship among the eight variables (AI anxiety, perceived usefulness, AI for social good, Attitude towards using AI, perceived confidence in teaching AI, relevance of AI, AI readiness, and behavioural intention) considered in the study. The result indicated that confidence in teaching AI predicts intention to teach AI while AI relevance strongly predicts readiness to teach AI. While other factors influence the teaching of AI, anxiety and social good could not predict teachers' intention and readiness to implement AI in classrooms respectively. We discussed the implication of our findings in relation to AI implementation in schools and highlight future directions.}

abstract = {As software interfaces become more intuitive and require less technical expertise, the robotic arm is not only becoming a tool for automating bespoke construction, it is becoming a tool to help bring the concept of the “Master Builder” back to the architectural profession. Being analogous to a human arm, it is easy to imagine limitless possibilities the robotic arm. However, understanding and utilizing it for the purpose of construction requires more knowledge than just imagining it as prosthetic. Besides a fundamental understanding of the digital workflow from the initial design based data (3D modelling) to machine understandable data (proprietary output code), it requires the design and conception of the robot's physical environment from the tool at the end of its arm (end effector) to its physical surroundings(work cell). Contemporary software tools provide the capabilities for manufacturing purposes and allow for virtual simulations of the production process, ensuring higher rates of success for construction. It is the crossover between the virtual environment and the physical world that will empower architects of the future to reclaim the title of master builders as they will be required to not only comprehend but design and participate in the entire building process inclusive of the manufacturing of components. This paper outlines a pedagogical framework to introduce the multi-layered levels of knowledge to students of architecture that will allow them to use a 6-axis robotic arm for the purpose of automated construction, making them aware of a new and complex building process that will be integral to redefining architecture in the near future.}

ABSTRACT
Since the introduction of the Zika virus (ZIKV) into Brazil in 2015, its transmission dynamics have been intensively studied in many parts of the country, although much is still unknown about its circulation in the midwestern states. Here, using nanopore technology, we obtained 23 novel partial and near-complete ZIKV genomes from the state of Goiás, located in the Midwest of Brazil. Genomic, phylogenetic, and epidemiological approaches were used to retrospectively explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the ZIKV-Asian genotype in this region. As a likely consequence of a gradual accumulation of herd immunity, epidemiological data revealed a decline in the number of reported cases over 2018 to 2021. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that multiple independent introductions of the Asian lineage have occurred in Goiás over time and revealed a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlight the utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understand mosquito-borne epidemics.
IMPORTANCE Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality of arboviral infections in Brazil, such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and yellow fever, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited availability of genomic data to track and control the epidemic. In this study, we provide a retrospective reconstruction of the Zika virus transmission dynamics in the state of Goiás by analyzing genomic data from areas in Midwest Brazil not covered by other previous studies. Our study provides an understanding of how ZIKV initiates transmission in this region and reveals a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlight the utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understand mosquito-borne epidemics, revealing how this toolkit can be used to help policymakers prioritize areas to be targeted, especially in the context of finite public health resources.}

To effectively promote and implement programming in K–12 education, it is necessary to understand school principals' perception of programming education. This study adopted a mixed methods design to explain principals’ understanding, expectations, and support for programming education in primary schools using Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). In study 1, survey questionnaires were distributed to all principals from public primary schools in Hong Kong. Two hundred and sixty-six principals responded to the survey (response rate = 55.6%). In study 2, a follow-up interview study with 13 principals was conducted to further explore their perception of programming education. The results of study 1 indicated that principals with a better understanding of programming education tend to have clearer expectations of how to implement programming education in their schools, which consequently leads to greater support for the implementation of programming education. In study 2, the thematic analysis further supported the results obtained in study 1. Specifically, the results of study 2 demonstrated that most principals show understanding, expectation, and support for the implementation of programming education, which in turn results in various positive student and teacher outcomes. The results also showed that challenges are inevitable during implementation, principals show capabilities and willingness to adjust their expectation and support to better integrate programming education into their school curricula.}

Fablabs could also mitigate the risk of unemployment due to automation by training cobot programmers for manufacturing jobs. In support of the proposed approach this paper introduces a participatory three-layer programming model designed to enable people with little or no programming experience to become effective cobot operators. The model builds on task-oriented programming environments extending them by more versatile yet intuitive programming environments.

Immersive technologies have become increasingly common worldwide, helping educators to improve the quality of dance pedagogy and increase the effectiveness of dance training. The article investigates the ways of using immersive technologies powered by artificial intelligence in dance education. The research explores the theoretical literature on dance education and the use of artificial intelligence in dance education and dance choreography. The scholars examine the impact of innovative technology solutions used in dance pedagogical practice on the development of dance skills in students. The study also discusses the functionality of interactive and multimedia dance teaching systems, including AI-powered virtual mentoring and cognitive simulations of human mind operations. The research analysed the use of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) in dance education. This research also focuses on mobile applications used for teaching modern dance. The proposed framework for dance education is based on digital technologies, which help to develop dance skills and improve teaching practices. The scholars conclude that the development and improvement of dance skills are possible only if a teacher combines virtual and real environments in everyday practices. The findings can be used by dance teachers, professional dancers, software developers, and researchers who examine the innovative practices and the application of artificial intelligence in dance education. The ecosystem model reframes thinking about approaches to dance education and can serve as the basis for further development of dance courses and dance style teaching modes.}

While there have been a few studies examining rhetorical moves and interactional metadiscourse in 3MT presentations, studies focusing on features related to comprehensibility, a key competition requirement, have been lacking. This study examines how highly-specialised research is made comprehensible to non-specialist audiences through “code glosses”, communication strategies that function to facilitate understanding by reformulating, explaining, or elaborating on what has been said (Hyland, 2005). Analysing a corpus of 50 successful 3MT presentations in the electrical and computer engineering discipline, we found code glosses to be one of the most frequently used interactive metadiscourse types in the data. Significantly, Analogies and Definitions emerged as salient-enough features in our data that we added them as additional categories of code gloss, extending Hyland's (2007) two categories of Exemplifiers and Reformulators. Our analysis shows how examples, definitions, analogies, and reformulations are used in distinct ways in 3MT presentations to make the presented research accessible, coherent, and engaging to audiences. Our findings expand current understandings of code glosses, and extend the current knowledge on the 3MT genre by providing insights into its distinctive linguistic features vis-à-vis comprehensibility.}

The self-report instrument, Computer Science Attitudes Scale for middle school students (MG-CS Attitudes), was developed based upon expectancy-value theory, which assumes two attitudinal constructs: self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. A set of ten initial items was administered to 663 middle-grade students from sixth to eighth grade (11–13 years of age). A combination of classical test theory and item response theory approaches were used to evaluate and validate the instrument using well-established construct validity frameworks to guide the process, leading to nine final items. The multi-stage validation process has resulted in a robust, well-functioning instrument, which can be used by researchers and evaluators to study CS-related educational interventions.}

The research findings show that teachers face challenges when they try to navigate the interdisciplinary space of mathematics, technology and societal issues (climate change) and that curiosity acts as a potential stimulus for determining how each pathway is developed and sustained.}

It also assumes that the co-occurrence of two or more keywords within the same article indicates a linkage between those topics. This study quantifies the thematic landscape of the CCI field and elaborates on emerging topics as these are manifested in publications in the two primary venues of the CCI field, namely the proceedings of the annual IDC conference and the International Journal of CCI. Overall, a total of 1059 articles, and their respective 2445 unique, author-assigned keywords, are included in our analyses — all papers have been published between 2003 and 2018. The results indicate that the community has focused (i.e., high frequency keywords) in areas including Participatory Design, Tangibles, Design, Education, Coding, and Making. These areas also demonstrate a high degree of ”coreness” (i.e., connection with different topics) and ”constraint” (i.e., connection with otherwise isolated topics). The analysis also highlights well-structured yet peripheral topics, as well as topics that are either marginally interesting, or have the potential to become of major importance to the entire research network in the near future.

abstract = {This paper considers the application of conceptual mathematics to construct a computational model of concepts and individuals. An applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. Since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. The nature of concepts – what concepts are – and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. It is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. The current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. The deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. The main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. Of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. Despite this “conceptual minimalism”, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. Using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.}

While substantial progress on exploring the potential benefits of VPE has been achieved, much remains to be done to understand students' acceptance of VPE and whether gender difference plays a role in their acceptance. This study was thus designed to extend the technology acceptance model to identify determinants influencing boys' and girls' behavioural intention to use VPE in the primary school context. It used a mixed method approach to evaluate the proposed model using questionnaire and interview data collected from 431 students (296 boys and 135 girls) in 38 primary schools. Among boys and girls, computer self-efficacy is shown to be the external factor significantly influencing both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of VPE, while attitude towards VPE is found to have a significant effect on behavioural intention to use VPE. In addition, gender differences are found in the impact of social influence and external encouragement on students' perceptions towards VPE, and also in the impact of students' perceptions towards VPE on their behavioural intention to use it. Based on the findings, several recommendations are made to encourage primary students to use VPE for programming.}

Increasingly, these environments are moving into the “cloud” where they can be accessed through web browsers and run on a variety of devices including tablets and smartphones. The shift to online settings enables a variety of powerful pedagogical features to be incorporated into the design of these learning environments, including making it easy to share learner-authored programs, browse projects written by others, and allow learners to incorporate various Internet resources into their work. Further, the Internet itself can serve as a productive canvas upon which novice programmers can create in the form of dynamic and interactive web pages. This shift in venue for authoring and editing programs is particularly well-suited for young learners growing up in an increasingly online world. In this paper, we present theoretical and practical arguments for online introductory programming environments as powerful learning tools and present data showing various ways young learners take advantage of features of the environment enabled by being situated online. In particular, the paper looks at how the online context can support young learners in authoring programs and interacting with programs authored by others. The contribution of this work is to advance our understanding of how the Internet can be utilized as a resource to situate learning and serve as an inviting and accessible pathway into computing.}

Lack of effective teaching modalities that can leverage real-world examples to stimulate student interest in STEM concepts are identified as one of the reasons for this crisis. To address these challenges, our research is investigating the use of innovative and attractive modeling and simulation frameworks for concurrent, interactive and collaborative STEM education where vehicular traffic serves as the real-world example to reify STEM concepts. Existing traffic-related tools, such as traffic simulators, however, do not provide: (1) intuitive abstractions to construct, refine, and simulate various traffic models that are commensurate to the level of high school students, (2) concurrent and scalable model execution, and (3) collaborative learning environments. On the other hand, although intuitive abstractions such as Google Maps exist, these abstractions do not support semantics for dynamic behavior, which is representative of real-world traffic scenarios. To overcome both these challenges and address the STEM problem, this paper presents a Cloud-based, Collaborative, and Scaled-up Modeling and Simulation Framework for STEM Education called C2SuMo. The key contribution of this paper lies in the design and implementation of a cloud-based, elastic modeling and simulation framework that provides an intuitive, model-driven, collaborative, and concurrent visual simulation environment for STEM education. The paper also reports on insights we gained conducting a user study involving over sixty high school students.}

Over the last two years, an institution of higher education and a private foundation worked together to address this problem by indexing text in thousands of annual school reports and combining multiple open data sets about schools, including geography, demographics, and academic performance, into a single database. The initial use case focused on understanding the existing computing education efforts in NYC. However, seeing the potential to inform a broader set of questions, the collaborators began exploring the utility of such data with program officers at the foundation. Interviews of program officers around their programmatic needs and challenges illuminated their struggles with analyzing scattered data, difficulty accessing non-academic data and the need for disaggregated and geographical data. These findings are being used to inform the development of a data portal that interfaces with the aggregated dataset for foundations and others interested in data about schools.}

Recurrent disease outbreaks caused by a range of emerging and resurging pathogens over the past decade reveal major gaps in public health preparedness, detection, and response systems in Africa. Underlying causes of recurrent disease outbreaks include inadequacies in the detection of new infectious disease outbreaks in the community, in rapid pathogen identification, and in proactive surveillance systems. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of zoonotic outbreaks occur, there remains the perennial risk of outbreaks of new or re-emerging pathogens for which no vaccines or treatments are available. As the Ebola virus disease, COVID-19, and mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) outbreaks highlight, a major paradigm shift is required to establish an effective infrastructure and common frameworks for preparedness and to prompt national and regional public health responses to mitigate the effects of future pandemics in Africa.}

Phase 1 consisted of the design of the Flipped PARSER (problem-attempt-research-solutions-evaluation-reflect) Model (FPM) through the study of documentation and research. Phase 2 involved using nine experts to assist with the model's development and evaluation using in-depth interviews and content analysis. Phase 3 involved the application and use of the FPM by 30 student-teachers, from which their AA, PSS, and satisfaction were evaluated against the control group of 31 participants. The results from the nine experts' input on the FPM design were significant. Instructor activities included selecting content, media, materials, and their design and development. Other components included learning activities, tools, lesson delivery, and evaluation. Also, PBL methods were again confirmed as an instrumental pedagogy in teaching PSS. When combined with online learning and flipped classrooms, the study's results were higher than those using traditional classroom methods. The study contributes to the literature by determining that online teaching models effectively teach PSS and raise AA scores.}

But, as opposed to a teleological framing that prioritizes ends, we propose using the metaphor of trading zones to construct a framing for computational empowerment that is based on collaborative multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge between people with different expertise. This leaves the co-design and implementation of CS education open to emergent directions and possibilities. Using a descriptive case study methodology, we detail trading zones in two different co-design projects that sought to situate CS education in relationship to cultural contexts through multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge: (1) a co-design project in a youth boxing gym with coaches, mentors, and staff; (2) a co-design project in a high school barbering program with a barbering instructor and barbering students. Our findings show that the metaphor is useful for the concept of computational empowerment in ways that are reflexive and interventionist.}

abstract = {The “Industry 4.0” production scenarios are determining a paradigm shift in the design of building components. The growing trend of orienting technological innovation in the building sector towards the eco-efficiency of industrial manufacturing processes increasingly requires to identify methods and tools able to support the design/manufacturing/construction process as a whole. In this sense, the intellectual and operational dimension of design is discovering a new digital and data-driven technological paradigm. Digital tools are pushing the investigation of the building component manufacturing process into an increasingly virtual dimension, in which the constant integration between environmental and material/geometric parameters identifies the meta-design phase as the “ideal place” to experiment the creative use of data and technical knowledge. Starting from these assumptions, the paper illustrates an original design methodology and the related digital/parametric workflow aimed at optimizing performances and production of a façade shading system realized in UHPFRC (Ultra High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete). The workflow described in this paper includes all the constraints arising from production and the assembly aspects of the components and, with the support of genetic algorithms, aims to improve indoor thermal comfort and indoor daylight performance while containing costs.}

abstract = {Background
There is an alarming trend in sub-Saharan Africa in the use of codeine-containing pharmaceuticals, but its risk of common comorbidities, such as mental health, remains unquantified at a national-level. We investigated the relationship between codeine use and onset of depression in South Africa at a population-level.
Methods
We used nationally representative panel data from the South Africa National Income Dynamic Study to investigate the relationship between exposure to codeine use in the community (i.e. residing in a codeine hotspot) and onset of depression. Geographical hotspots of codeine use were identified using Kulldorff spatial scan statistic in SaTScan. We quantified depression onset at Wave 5 (year 2017) between individuals residing inside and outside a codeine hotspot who were depression-free at enrolment (Wave 4: 2015) using generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression models.
Results
We identified four statistically significant hotspots of codeine use, mostly located at the northern part of the country. Among 13,020 participants who were depression-free at enrolment, residing within a codeine use hotspot was significantly associated with higher subsequent onset of depression (aRR=1.21, 95% CI:1.08-1.44).
Limitations
Data on diagnosis of depressive disorder were not available.
Conclusion
South Africa, a resource scarce nation with chronically limited mental health services, is not spared from the global opioid epidemic and its impact on depression. Targeted scale-up access to agonist therapy to effectively treat (opioid) addiction in communities at risk for high exposure to codeine use could reduce the risk of subsequent mental health challenges.}

Programmable toys, activities with physical materials and various games are some of the resources available. Amongst those, digital games possess important elements for learning programming, such as incremental challenges, personalised immediate feedback, and visualisation of the consequences of errors. In this work, we explore the results of an experience based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children. Our aim was to investigate how such concepts are presented in the games’ interface and what is the impact of the interaction elements on children’s comprehension. This work took place in Informatics classes of a Brazilian school, with 42 students aged 5 to 7 years. Data were collected through participant observation, and semi-structured and unstructured interviews, focusing on the main difficulties faced by the children when interacting with the games. Topics, skills and competences were considered according to the syllabus proposed by Computing at School, and encompassed sequences of instructions, repetition loops and conditionals. Results indicate a satisfactory understanding of sequences of instructions and conditionals, but also show challenges with respect to graphical symbols, text and interaction elements identified as hard to understand for the children, making the support of an adult fundamental. Another critical point was the comprehension of the concept of repetition, which made the use of complementary approaches necessary, in particular unplugged playful activities. This shows that despite the increasing number of available digital games that involve programming basics, good solutions for conveying the main concepts to young children have not yet been found, demanding further investigation, possibly towards structured hybrid approaches combining digital games and unplugged activities.}

The paper aims at widening the scope of Educational Robotics and expanding the pedagogical possibilities of this field. To this end, the paper draws on the outcomes of two case studies carried out with primary and secondary school children aimed at investigating their views about robots. These studies allow framing and identifying five themes we believe are particularly relevant to rethink the pedagogy of Educational Robotics. Using these themes as cornerstones for reflection, we delineate a set of dimensions and paths to move Educational Robotics beyond the focus on technical skills but instead explore its potential as a boundary object to involve children in reflective processes around the ethical, social and cultural implications of emerging intelligent technologies.}

The study findings indicated that participants developed significantly more positive dispositions toward mathematics after computer game making. The study also found that experience-driven game design processes helped to activate children's reflection on everyday mathematical experiences. Mathematical thinking and content experience were intertwined within the process of computer game authoring. On the other hand, children designers were involved in game-world and story crafting more than mathematical representation.

Low-code/no-code (LCNC) is an emerging technology trend that extends software development beyond professionalsoftware engineers, making it accessible to individuals throughout organizations and society.
Objective
We aim to provide a systematic review of the current research on the adoption of LCNC technologies within citizen development (CD) practices for digital transformation (DT), and to propose a research agenda for this field.
Method
This review is primarily conducted using a multi-phase systematic literature review of publications from the past five years, i.e., between 2017 and 2023.
Results
We identified 40 primary studies that describes the application of LCNC development and CD practices, the theoretical lenses/frameworks used, and the associated benefits and challenges.
Conclusion
In this study, we present three key contributions. First, we provide a comprehensive review of the benefits, challenges, theoretical perspectives, and methods used to explore LCNC and CD adoption. Second, we introduce a framework designed to guide managers in effectively adopting LCNC and CD practices. Finally, our systematic review uncovers gaps in existing research and identifies opportunities for further exploration, which paves the way for a future research agenda.}

Researchers have developed various assessments for maker activities to examine students' learning outcomes. However, a systematic review of research on such assessments is lacking. To fill this gap, we reviewed empirical studies on maker-based assessments in education. We systematically examined 60 studies regarding the overall features of the maker activities, the learning outcomes that were measured, the assessment formats, and the psychometric evidence of the assessments. Our review results indicate that more than 20 types of maker platforms have been employed in the activities, with e-textiles and LilyPad Arduino being the most popular. Five types of assessment tools have been used prevalently to examine students' diverse learning outcomes, specifically artifact assessments, tests, surveys, interviews, and observations. Most assessments are used in STEM-related maker activities, especially technology-centric activities, to measure STEM-related learning outcomes. Only 15% of the studies provide psychometric evidence of reliability and validity for the assessments. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions for future research which include developing more low-tech maker activities for students in lower-grades and with lower technology proficiency. In addition, future studies should improve rubrics for artifact assessment and explore more assessment tools for non-STEM subjects.}

Recent works stress the importance of aiming beyond the acquisition of corresponding technical competences and call for fostering children’s empowerment and participation in digitalization. Computational Empowerment (CE) pursues that goal through a creative and reflexive participatory design approach. However, remaining conceptual vagueness with regard to what CE entails may hinder its implementation in formal education. This paper addresses this gap, with the aim to demonstrate what is needed to advance CE’s position in this context. To this end, we elaborate on our understanding of CE’s vision, approach and impact. We then examine CE in the context of formal education, and contrast it with selected contemporary educational theory and practice. Specifically, we position CE in relation to an established learning framework (Bloom’s revised taxonomy), educational policy (DigComp) and practices in the classroom. This is complemented by an analysis of four different projects: we present lessons learned in the context of pedagogical interventions and take a closer look at the accompanying empowerment processes. As a result, this paper provides a foundation to make CE’s ideas more tangible and, thus, actionable, for researchers, policy makers and educators.}

At the beginning and the end of the project, each participant separately completed (a) computer programming knowledge assessments and (b) questionnaires rating their affinity for their partner. Results support the proposition that liking promotes learning: Greater partner affinity predicted greater subsequent increases in computer programming knowledge for both partners. One partner's initial programming knowledge also positively predicted the other partner's subsequent partner affinity.}

With a response rate of 72%, 54 primary schools participated in the study. A survey was conducted and four hundred and thirty-two students were included in the moderated mediation analysis. The results showed that high achievers' attitudes towards programming positively related to their flow experience, which further positively associated with their programming intentions. In addition, teacher support moderated the relationship between high achievers’ attitudes and their flow experience; such that when teacher support increased, the flow experience was weaker for those with comparatively higher positive attitudes. The practical implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed.}

Having a high intelligence quotient does not guarantee a successful and happy life. Success also necessitates self-awareness and emotional control. Our idea was to create a computational paradigm that would educate students in both programming and emotional intelligence. This experiment was successful in addressing the problem of excessive screen use by providing a student interface without displays.}

abstract = {Free and open source tools present numerous opportunities to support current urban planning practice. However, their overview is fragmented, and the uptake among planning professionals remains lacklustre. Recent discourse in the domain of planning support tools attribute poor take up to the lack of understanding on the landscape and functionality of available tools, and how tools can add value to the planning process. We provide an understanding of the state of the art concerning open source tools for urban planning from journal articles, software repositories, and social media. Our search documented 70 open source tools that support different stages of the urban planning process. We cover an additional set of 54 peripheral tools to support domains related to urban planning. In the process, we formalise and describe the urban planning process and find that the entire planning process can be conducted using open source software. Tools focusing on street networks and geographic spatial analysis are the mainstay of current implementation. Sixty percent of tools are only accessible through an application programming interface, while 43% rely on Python for development. The scenario planning, public participation, and evaluation phases of the planning process present many untapped opportunities for open source software development. Findings will help urban planners and researchers to employ these tools for professional practice, and assist software developers to identify opportunities for software development in urban research.}

abstract = {Despite the multiple deep knowledge tracing (DKT) methods developed for intelligent tutoring systems and online learning environments, there exists only a few applications of such methods in educational computer games. One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners’ knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy. Interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to RNN and LSTM in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners’ performance in game tasks.}

Building on four existing principles in child–computer interaction, namely Closeness, Embodied Learning, Design Process and Decoding, we explore how computational empowerment can be scaffolded in practice. This study was part of an interdisciplinary research project exploring emerging technologies in education (CEED). We involved 9 teachers and 26 students (14–15 y) in Denmark in teaching about machine learning and augmented reality. In the article we develop a framework for applying computational empowerment in formal educational contexts. Based on the study, we found that computational empowerment builds on distinct layers which are these four principles. Specifically, merging the principles Closeness and Embodied Learning can increase student engagement and motivation in the activities; in addition, Decoding and Design Process are key principles for promoting student awareness of the societal impacts of emerging technologies. Based on qualitative data from this intervention, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for child–computer interaction in moving toward computational empowerment in practice.}

However, most offer only restricted access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other computers or accessing resources and data on the internet), the limited support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. We argue that it is feasible to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely-used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. The paper presents the architecture of and design decisions behind NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas. We show how NetsBlox expands opportunities for learning considerably: NetsBlox projects can access a wealth of online data and web services, and they can communicate with other projects. Moreover, the tool infrastructure enables young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction, whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. In this way, NetsBlox offers an illuminating example of how tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.}

A quasi-experimental design was employed in this study. The participants consisted of 180 students taking general courses at a university in southern Taiwan. Instruments included the Test of Basic Programming Concept and a self-efficacy questionnaire. The results indicated that the VPL teaching improved learners' understanding of basic programming concepts in the experimental group. The effect on basic programming concepts was especially large in students with moderate and low self-efficacy.

A quasi-experimental study that utilized a non-equivalent groups design was conducted with 91 fifth-grade students, comprising a control group (n = 46) who received the PBP intervention, and an intervention group (n = 45) who received the REP intervention. Creative self-efficacy, Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking Figural (TTCT-Figural), and assessment of the students’ robotic creative products were conducted to evaluate students’ creativity. In addition, t tests, ANCOVA, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data to determine whether REP could improve students’ creativity better than PBP. The results showed that REP could enhance students’ creative self-efficacy and their robotic creative products score more than PBP could, but not the TTCT-Figural score after the confounding effect of fluency was controlled for. In the intervention group, creative self-efficacy and creative thinking were improved after intervention. Overall, REP has more advantages than PBP for promoting primary school students' creativity. The findings of this study provide a reference and teaching strategies guidance for the cultivation of K-12 students' creativity in robotics education.}

Although studies in mathematics education have shown that reading strategies are positively related to mathematics learning, the relation may not be linear as widely believed. Recent research in language assessment has found that the association between reading strategies and reading performance fluctuates as language proficiency increases, a pattern metaphorically called the Island Ridge Curve (IRC). Inspired by the IRC, we hypothesize that the relation between reading strategies and mathematics learning also fluctuates in the pattern of the IRC as students' reading proficiency increases. To verify this assumption, we used a public dataset of 529,091 15-year-old students (M = 15.79, SD = 0.29) from 77 countries/territories. Results of multilevel mixture regression analysis indicated that reading strategies (in our case, understanding and memorizing strategies) are related to mathematics learning through reading proficiency and this relation fluctuates like the IRC. Implications for applying IRC to reading strategies instruction in mathematics education are discussed. (170 words).}

Drawing on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), we gathered teachers' perspectives through eight variables of technology integration, social influence, AI ethics, attitudes, TPACK, perceived self-efficacy, AI professional development, and AI preparedness. To analyze the 430 teachers' data involved in this study, we used a structural equation modeling analytical approach with SmartPLS software version 4.1.0.0. Our results indicate that technology integration, social influence, attitudes, and perceived self-efficacy influence teachers’ preparedness for AI.

abstract = {Background
In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa, there is paucity of data on SARS-CoV-2 infections among children attending school, including seroprevalence and transmission dynamics.
Objective
This pilot study aims to assess (1) the prevalence of self-reported or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 prior infections, COVID-19 symptoms (including long COVID), seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and general/mental health, (2) longitudinal changes in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 acute infections, immune responses, transmission dynamics, and symptomatic versus asymptomatic contacts in a unique cohort of unvaccinated primary school learners, their parents, teachers, and close contacts in semirural primary school settings.
Methods
Learners (grades 1-7) from primary schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, their parents, and teachers will be invited to enroll into the COVID kids school study (CoKiDSS). CoKiDSS comprises 3 parts: a cross-sectional survey (N=640), a follow-up survey (n=300), and a nested case-cohort substudy. Finger-prick blood and saliva samples will be collected for serological and future testing, respectively, in the cross-sectional (451 learners:147 parents:42 teachers) and follow-up (210 learners:70 parents:20 teachers) surveys. The nested case-cohort substudy will include cases from the cross-sectional survey with confirmed current SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=30) and their close contacts (n=up to 10 per infected participant). Finger-prick blood (from all substudy participants), venous blood (from cases), and nasal swabs (from cases and contacts) will be collected for serological testing, immunological testing, and viral genome sequencing, respectively. Questionnaires covering sociodemographic and general and mental health information, prior and current SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and testing information, vaccination status, preventative behavior, and lifestyle will be administered. Statistical methods will include generalized linear mixed models, intracluster correlation, descriptive analysis, and graphical techniques.
Results
A total of 645 participants were enrolled into the cross-sectional survey between May and August 2023. A subset of 300 participants were followed up in the follow-up survey in October 2023. Screening of the participants into the nested case-cohort substudy is planned between November 2023 and September 2024. Data cleanup and analysis for the cross-sectional survey is complete, while those for the follow-up survey and nested case substudy will be completed by the third quarter of 2024. The dissemination and publication of results is anticipated for the fourth quarter of 2024.
Conclusions
This study provides data from an LMIC setting on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on school-attending learners, their parents, and teachers 3 years after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was declared and 21-24 months after resumption of normal school attendance. In particular, this study will provide data on the prevalence of self-reported or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 prior infection, prior and current symptoms, seroprevalence, changes in seroprevalence, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immune responses, and symptoms of long COVID and mental health among a triad of learners, their parents, and teachers.

abstract = {In the literature, metaheuristics are proposed as alternatives to traditional techniques such as grid search, gradient descent, randomized search, and experimental methods in tuning the hyperparameters of Machine Learning (ML) models. Metaheuristics have fast convergence times, flexibility, robustness, local optima avoidance, and intelligence. The performance of ML models is highly dependent on choosing optimal hyperparameters. This chapter explores the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and five of its selected improvement capabilities in optimally tuning the hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVMs are margin-based ML classifiers and are popular owing to their simplicity, high generalization, and accuracy. SVMs' hyperparameter tuning is analyzed with seven standard datasets, including Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Iris, MNIST, Wine Recognition, Glass Identification, Cars Evaluation, and Indian Liver Patients.}

abstract = {Nowadays, programming skills are receiving widespread attention for different age groups alongside occupational education programs to better prepare individuals for their future careers. However, introducing programming concepts in an appropriate manner is a challenge in higher education. The main assumption of this study is that enhancing the classical introduction to programming courses through real-life problem-based game development with Scratch programming environment potentially improves the learners' programming skills and motivation. Accordingly, in this study, during one academic semester period, the Introduction to Programming course for engineering students is enriched up to a certain level through real-life game development projects with Scratch. The students are followed within a four-year period starting from freshman until their graduation. The progress of the students who have taken the Introduction to Programming course in enriched or classical form in the fourth year Senior-project course are evaluated. The results show that by slightly improving the course curriculum through real-life game development projects in the Scratch environment, students’ performance on the graduation projects improved significantly. As a conclusion, game-based learning, problem-based learning, visual programming and projects are technologies that can potentially help learners to perform better in the introduction to programming course, in turn affecting their performances in projects.}

Specifically, we attend to the ways in which children can be centered at the computational science exhibit (moments in which their goals, histories, and desires are driving the exhibit’s interaction) by the actions of parents and museum facilitators or be decentered by them. Through qualitative analysis of video-recorded interactions of adults and children at the exhibit, we present categories of centering or decentering interactions while preserving the nuance and ambiguity involved in sociocultural contexts of learning. We also highlight two cases that illustrate the complexity and heterogeneity involved in facilitating a computational science exhibit. We close with a discussion and a call to eschew technocentric views of computing education that focus solely on device-level engagement and instead attend to the complex human–human interactions involved in computing education.}

The present study examines the effectiveness of an after-school version of the GDL program using a quasi-experimental design. Students enrolled in the GDL program were guided in the process of designing games aimed at solving problems. Compared to students in a control group who did not attend the program (n = 24), the children who attended the GDL program (n = 20) showed a significant increase in their problem-solving skills.

The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccines or infection. However, whether Omicron triggers cross-reactive humoral responses to other variants of concern (VOCs) remains unknown. We used plasma from 20 unvaccinated and 7 vaccinated individuals infected by Omicron BA.1 to test binding, Fc effector function, and neutralization against VOCs. In unvaccinated individuals, Fc effector function and binding antibodies targeted Omicron and other VOCs at comparable levels. However, Omicron BA.1-triggered neutralization was not extensively cross-reactive for VOCs (14- to 31-fold titer reduction), and we observed 4-fold decreased titers against Omicron BA.2. In contrast, vaccination followed by breakthrough Omicron infection associated with improved cross-neutralization of VOCs with titers exceeding 1:2,100. This has important implications for the vulnerability of unvaccinated Omicron-infected individuals to reinfection by circulating and emerging VOCs. Although Omicron-based immunogens might be adequate boosters, they are unlikely to be superior to existing vaccines for priming in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals.}

abstract = {Background
Medical postgraduates’ demand for data capabilities is growing, as biomedical research becomes more data driven, integrative, and computational. In the context of the application of big data in health and medicine, the integration of data mining skills into postgraduate medical education becomes important.
Objective
This study aimed to demonstrate the design and implementation of a medical data mining course for medical postgraduates with diverse backgrounds in a medical school.
Methods
We developed a medical data mining course called “Practical Techniques of Medical Data Mining” for postgraduate medical education and taught the course online at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). To identify the background knowledge, programming skills, and expectations of targeted learners, we conducted a web-based questionnaire survey. After determining the instructional methods to be used in the course, three technical platforms—Rain Classroom, Tencent Meeting, and WeChat—were chosen for online teaching. A medical data mining platform called Medical Data Mining - R Programming Hub (MedHub) was developed for self-learning, which could support the development and comprehensive testing of data mining algorithms. Finally, we carried out a postcourse survey and a case study to demonstrate that our online course could accommodate a diverse group of medical students with a wide range of academic backgrounds and programming experience.
Results
In total, 200 postgraduates from 30 disciplines participated in the precourse survey. Based on the analysis of students’ characteristics and expectations, we designed an optimized course structured into nine logical teaching units (one 4-hour unit per week for 9 weeks). The course covered basic knowledge of R programming, machine learning models, clinical data mining, and omics data mining, among other topics, as well as diversified health care analysis scenarios. Finally, this 9-week course was successfully implemented in an online format from May to July in the spring semester of 2020 at PUMC. A total of 6 faculty members and 317 students participated in the course. Postcourse survey data showed that our course was considered to be very practical (83/83, 100% indicated “very positive” or “positive”), and MedHub received the best feedback, both in function (80/83, 96% chose “satisfied”) and teaching effect (80/83, 96% chose “satisfied”). The case study showed that our course was able to fill the gap between student expectations and learning outcomes.
Conclusions
We developed content for a data mining course, with online instructional methods to accommodate the diversified characteristics of students. Our optimized course could improve the data mining skills of medical students with a wide range of academic backgrounds and programming experience.}

This exploratory study engaged teams of elementary and middle school students in the collaborative design of digital games. Game design is theoretically examined in this study as a form of knowledge-creating learning that is characterized by collaborative efforts to advance a shared object of activity, i.e., the game being designed. Using mixed methods, we examined how students experienced the game design project and how the project fostered connected learning, that is, integration of students’ personal interests and supportive peer relations with their schoolwork, and how their self-assessed digital competences developed.
Methods
The digital competences of 98 comprehensive school students across Finland were traced using pre- and post-questionnaires. The post-questionnaire also included validated measures on connected learning. Quantitative methods were used to analyze structured measures, and qualitative methods were used to analyze open-ended measures.
Findings
Students experienced game design as an inspiring, challenging activity. Game design engaged student teams in sustained, collaborative efforts to create shared digital artifacts. Their efforts involved a great deal of mutual support and knowledge sharing. Participation also improved students’ self-reported technical and artistic digital competences. The game design project fostered informal, interest-driven, sociodigital participation; inspired learning engagement; and improved schoolwork practices.
Contribution
The game design project appeared to be a pedagogically meaningful way of engaging students in knowledge-creating learning and of connecting students' formal and informal learning. The project sparked students’ motivation to learn, fostered digital competences, and enriched the learning environment.}

abstract = {Background
Nursing education increasingly emphasizes academic writing and communication, critical for delivering quality patient care and professional advancement. Rapidly emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot are transforming educational methodologies, and a focus is being placed on embedding AI literacy to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. These technologies have the potential to reshape nursing education in a technology-driven health-care landscape.
Aim
This study investigated the effectiveness of AI literacy and the application of ChatGPT and Copilot in academic nursing report writing. It assessed the level of AI literacy of nursing students, examined the integration of basic AI concepts into a curriculum, and analyzed the impact of these tools compared with traditional teaching methods.
Methods
The study adopted a sample of 203 senior nursing students from Southern Taiwan to compare an AI-enhanced teaching approach using ChatGPT and Copilot with conventional methods. The curriculum, centered on the “Writing Case Reports and Seminars” course, employed the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate model and incorporated scaffolding techniques to synergistically integrate clinical skills with academic learning. AI literacy was measured using the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS). Summative assessments, adhering to the Taiwan Nursing Association standards, focused on individual and group case report evaluations.
Findings
Following an 18-week AI intervention, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in all dimensions of the MAILS. A ChatGPT usage of 100 % was found, with a notable enhancement discovered in the “Nursing Plan” section of case reports. Although the experimental group outperformed the control group in overall case report evaluations, the connections between identified problems and proposed plans were weaker and nursing interventions tended to be less individualized for the experimental group.
Conclusions
The incorporation of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot into a scaffolding teaching framework significantly boosted students' AI literacy and performance in summative assessments. Effective AI training for students, supervised use of these tools, and continuous professional development for educators are paramount to successful implementation. Addressing the current limitations of AI has the potential to further improve academic writing, foster critical thinking, and ensure responsible application in patient care, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more effective nursing education.}

However, teachers have repeatedly reported a set of impediments that hampers them to succeed. This integration requires a set of changes in the school organization, resourcing and a proper teacher training. A Community of Practice formed by different stakeholders of a local educational community might provide the necessary grounds to lead to this transition. In this paper, we report our experience of creating and scaffolding a local Community of Practice for a period of ten months. We present the different activities we carried out during this period, emphasizing a digital fabrication training that we conducted, at our university Fab Lab premises, for teachers and school principals separately. We also explore the influence of this training on scaffolding of the development of the Community of Practice. We expect the training structure, discussion and insights presented in this paper would inspire other researchers and practitioners trying to bring digital fabrication to formal education.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this collaborative self-study inquiry was to enhance the professional practice of faculty members through the adoption of lesson study. A seven-member faculty of education self-study group engaged in lesson study in a computer and learning resources for primary/elementary teachers’ course with teacher candidates.
Design/methodology/approach
This study focused on providing teacher candidates with increased opportunities for action and expression during in-class instruction. This collaborative lesson study inquiry (Fernandez et al., 2003; Fernandez and Yoshida, 2004; Murata, 2011) involved the four-step process of planning, doing, checking and acting (PDCA) (Cheng, 2019). Several data collection methods were adopted and data sources analyzed.
Findings
Challenges the group encountered during the study included ascertaining the goals of lesson study and offering critical feedback to each other. While this made decision-making more intricate and intentional, there was exceptional value in participating in the lesson study process. The results revealed three overarching themes: 1) challenges in classroom observations; 2) hesitation in providing supportive feedback to colleagues and 3) deliberations regarding what constitutes expertise within subject-specific preservice teacher education.
Originality/value
While lesson study has been adopted fairly extensively in K-12 settings, its adoption in postsecondary education is limited (Chenault, 2017). Considering the merits of lesson study for K-12 practitioners, this research investigated the similar advantages that lesson study might have for postsecondary education faculty, students and programs.}

Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet theory, where the Gauss–Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein–Scalar–Gauss–Bonnet model, the Gauss–Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe’s early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate.}

A formal research protocol collected 602 articles. After using exclusions criteria, 123 proceeded to a detailed analysis. This investigation allowed answering the following research questions: How are makerspaces implemented and used in schools? Under what pedagogical aspects are maker practices justified and developed in Basic Education? Results indicate that most mapped works address issues related to maker practices at school and active learning methodologies. Current studies show proposals or exemplify actions with students, broadening the debate on the effectiveness and limitations of maker activities in the school environment. Noteworthy is the importance of teacher training for a better understanding of Maker Education and a greater affinity for using manual, electrical, and digital tools. The social role of the school makerspace as an environment that promotes inclusion, accessibility, diversity, equity, identity, and empowerment is an emerging theme that requires attention. However, there needs to be more information regarding the management and transformation of school spaces to adequately and safely shelter maker practices, coherently connecting the principles of the maker movement to educational ones, indicating that there is still a vast area of research on this subject.}

The study employed a mixed-methods design. Data were collected from multiple sources including, pre and post survey data on teacher knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology (N = 94), as well as interviews and classroom implementation data from eight case study participants. Findings from this work indicated that participants reported improvements in their knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology. They also applied new learning into their practice, though implementation varied among participants. Responding on the value of the professional development design features, teachers noted the importance of focusing on CS content knowledge as well as opportunities to engage with pedagogical practices for teaching computing. Findings also indicated the important role of contextualized follow-up classroom support in the implementation of new learning into practice. These findings have implications for the design of professional development programs grounded in best practices with the potential to support broad efforts intended to prepare teachers with the knowledge and skills needed to deliver CS education.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Young women in sub-Saharan Africa continue to bear a high burden of HIV infection. Combination anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies are a potential HIV prevention technology that could overcome adherence challenges of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis. In this phase 1 clinical trial we aimed to determine the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of the broadly neutralising monoclonal antibody CAP256V2LS.
Methods
CAPRISA 012B, a first-in-human dose-escalation phase 1 trial evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and neutralisation activity of CAP256V2LS alone and in combination with VRC07-523LS in young HIV-negative women in Durban, South Africa. Groups 1 and 2 were open label with CAP256V2LS administered at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg intravenously and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg subcutaneously. In group 3, participants were randomly allocated to receive a combination of CAP256V2LS and VRC07-523LS at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg subcutaneously comixed with ENHANZE, a recombinant human hyaluronidase. Once safety was established in the first three participants, dose escalation took place sequentially following review of safety data. Primary endpoints were the proportion of participants with mild, moderate, and severe reactogenicity or adverse events, graded as per the Division of AIDS toxicity grading. The trial is registered on the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR202003767867253, and is recruiting.
Findings
From July 13, 2020, to Jan 13, 2021, 42 HIV-negative women, aged 18–45 years, were enrolled. All 42 participants, eight with intravenous and 34 with subcutaneous administration, completed the trial. There were no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. Most commonly reported symptoms following intravenous administration were headaches in seven (88%) and nausea in four (50%) participants. Commonly reported symptoms following subcutaneous administration were headache in 31 (91%), chills in 25 (74%), and malaise or fatigue in 19 (56%) participants. Adverse events included transient lymphocytopenia in eight (19%), proteinuria in nine (21%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase in ten (24%), and alanine aminotransferase in five (12%) participants.
Interpretation
CAP256V2LS administered alone and in combination with VRC07-523LS was safe with favourable pharmacokinetics and neutralisation activity, supporting further assessment in larger clinical studies.

This paper presents the design of such an instrument—PCBUQ. It is rapid in that it consists of few items. It is inclusive because designed for different young children. It is for the basics of physical computing in that it considers physical input and output devices, basic patterns and programs that use them for interacting with the physical world. Data gathered from experts, primary and middle schools were used to validate PCBUQ. The first items assess children’s capability of classifying physical devices as input (e.g., buttons), and output devices (e.g., LED, speaker). The other items evaluate whether children can interpret problematic scenarios and infer how to resolve them with adequate input and output devices, patterns and programs. PCBUQ was found to have adequate reliability. The reported statistical analyses highlight the items that strongly and weakly correlate with the construct under analysis, their difficulty and discrimination. Results are discussed to guide future physical computing initiatives for children and their assessment.}

Digital fabrication (DF) and design thinking (DT) have been suggested as approaches to developing students’ understanding of technology and their agency in a digitised world. However, nowadays teachers are not being trained in this field. In order to prepare the next generation for a rapidly changing and unknown future heavily influenced by computing it thus seems necessary to focus on the professional development (PD) of teachers. This study investigates how development of professional practice can be conducted to empower teachers and principals to implement DF and DT activities in schools. Initially, the paper gives an overview of nine educational initiatives in the field, followed by a closer examination of the Danish FabLab@SCHOOLdk organisation. The paper identifies the different PD programmes aimed at empowering in-service teachers, pedagogues, and principals in the field of DF and DT. As the main contribution to the research community, the study identifies five important stakeholders that are supporting and operating in synergy inside the FabLab@SCHOOLdk initiative as well as the surrounding gatekeepers with influence on the development processes. The paper further illustrates how the stakeholders operate in the organisation to enable educators to apply DF and DT in schools and discusses the development of professional practice in this field. Finally, a 1:1:1 -model for realising research-based suggestions in PD programmes is presented.}

However, apart from this beneficial effect, increased levels of population mean set-point viral load (SPVL), an estimator for HIV virulence, have been observed in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the decade following the introduction of ART in The Netherlands. Several studies have been devoted to explain these counter-intuitive trends in SPVL. However, to our knowledge, none of these studies has investigated an explanation in which it arises as the result of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) co-factor in detail. In this study, we adapted an event-based, individual-based model to investigate how STI co-infection and sexual risk behaviour affect the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM before and after the introduction of ART. The results suggest that sexual risk behaviour has an effect on SPVL and indicate that more data are needed to test the effect of STI co-factors on SPVL. Furthermore, the observed trends in SPVL cannot be explained by sexual risk behaviour and STI co-factors only. We recommend to develop mathematical models including also factors related to viral evolution as reported earlier in the literature. However, this requires more complex models, and the collection of more data for parameter estimation than what is currently available.}

According to findings, the students' assembling bricks, sharing ideas and experiences, and the teachers' providing guidance and asking questions were the most frequent behaviors. Regarding behavioral sequences, the teachers' guidance significantly followed the students' behavior of expressing and sharing their ideas that followed the teachers’ questions. The students also significantly tended to play with robots that they themselves designed. Moreover, the teacher-student interactions were discussed in detail in terms of gender differences and difficulty level of robotics activities.

Our analysis shows that while there are a number of ongoing initiatives dedicated to developing instruments and curricula for assessment of 21st century skills, there are also fundamental challenges for the development of relevant assessments on a systemic level and for transforming practices related to 21st century skills more broadly. The lack of representation from several parts of the world, in international assessment initiatives on 21st century skills, is also striking. By taking a meta-perspective, we identify evolving themes within this field and provide a critical perspective on these developments. We conclude there are a number of opportunities and pitfalls for creating good synergies between 21st century skills in curricula and practices, as well as for developing assessment strategies.}

Two challenges of constructing an accurate and comprehensive learner model integrating cognitive and metacognitive were summarized. A plan of constructing a comprehensive learner model was made based on analysis of existing massive online learning environment, sensor information technology and educational data-mining. As a case study, a method of how to map learning data onto learners’ cognitive and metacognitive was proposed based on an analysis of a number of pupils’ Scratch projects. Three mapping table were established. Pupil’s cognitive skill could be evaluated from technology shown from Scratch project, namely, data structure, algorithm, computational practices and overall evaluation. Content shown from Scratch project were used to infer pupil’s cognitive style. Meta-cognitive ability can be measured from computational practices and behavior in programming process.}

abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) literacy is key to solving future societal challenges and to leading an independent and responsible life in an increasingly globalized and digitalized world. Hence, countries around the world have promoted research on students' ICT skills and their inclusion in curricula. Despite these efforts, little is known about what predicts future ICT literacy, and prior research has almost exclusively conducted cross-sectional studies. In the present study, we addressed this gap by using data from a large-scale longitudinal study of 6810 students in 311 schools from Germany. These students participated in the National Educational Panel Study over the course of secondary school (in Grades 6, 9, and 12). We were particularly interested in investigating potential spillover effects from skills and dispositions that are inherently fostered in school on ICT development. Thus, we considered a rich set of different types of predictors related to the students' social, cultural, demographic, and learning backgrounds; their subject-specific motivation; and the composition of their schools, and we assessed the extent to which these variables explained variation in ICT literacy development at two key stages in the educational system (Grades 9 and 12). Our results indicated that prior ICT literacy was the most important predictor of future ICT literacy but more so for the development between Grades 9 and 12. In addition, variables related to the students' learning backgrounds, followed by variables related to the composition of their schools and students' subject-specific motivation explained future ICT literacy. Overall, the predictors explained between 49% and 67% of the variation in future ICT literacy. Our longitudinal findings suggest that the learning environment and students’ skills and dispositions are crucial for understanding ICT development and are indicative of the deliberate design of ICT interventions.}

We use word embeddings to automate the identification of teachers' community contributions as representing ‘active’ engagement by manipulating course materials, or ‘constructive’ engagement through the generation of new knowledge. We explored individual variation in engagement across units. Our findings demonstrated that the participants' cognitive engagement is influenced by the nature of MOOC tasks. We adopted a manual content analysis approach to explore constructive contributions. From 67 cases considered, all but one case was identified as containing ‘constructive knowledge’, providing a solid basis for replicating our proposed methodology to analyse cognitive engagement within the community-centric MOOC models.}

This article looks at how students organize the use of different artifacts when creating computer games about historical topics. The data informing this article consist of video data collected from one sixth-grade class and one seventh-grade class in Norway. A sociocultural perspective is used to show how the students use a combination of different artifacts as resources in the game design process, focusing on how students take epistemic stances and how the artifacts are given different epistemic status. The students jointly construct knowledge that they then integrate into computer games using artifacts such as textbooks, world maps, Google, and timelines. The article shows how designing games about historical topics is a complex process in which students use artifacts as the basis for knowledge claims and storytelling, and students need to negotiate and balance their own design preferences with historical accuracy and the expectations of the classroom setting.}

Yet no currently available programming tools exist that have been specifically created to enable youth to create such systems. Similarly, industrial and academic programming practices often involve the simultaneous production and subsequent integration of code by multiple collaborators. But few youth-focused programming tools have been designed to support this form of authentic participation in computing. We describe the design of a new programming environment that addresses both of these needs. It empowers adolescents to design, make, and program interactive, tangible networked technologies, indicating the feasibility of networked technology as a design and programming genre for youth. We show how distributed programming tools can offer young people agency to work within a variety of collaboration structures. We present results from two U.S. middle school classroom implementations. Students created a wide variety of projects that included interaction design, physical artifact design and making, and network programming. Students enacted a variety of collaboration approaches that were responsive to their creative goals and inter-personal relationships. They programmed a system of small single-board computers that process input and output information from connected sensors, actuators, or synthesizers, and communicate over a network. Students constructed different collaborative structures, from pair to jigsaw programming. Our contribution is to show what the technical content and social structure of future computing education environments for youth could be.}

abstract = {Recent years have seen the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in every facet of society. The ubiquity of AI has led to an increasing demand to integrate AI learning experiences into K-12 education. Early learning experiences incorporating AI concepts and practices are critical for students to better understand, evaluate, and utilize AI technologies. AI planning is an important class of AI technologies in which an AI-driven agent utilizes the structure of a problem to construct plans of actions to perform a task. Although a growing number of efforts have explored promoting AI education for K-12 learners, limited work has investigated effective and engaging approaches for delivering AI learning experiences to elementary students. In this article, we propose a visual interface to enable upper elementary students (grades 3–5, ages 8–11) to formulate AI planning tasks within a game-based learning environment. We present our approach to designing the visual interface as well as how the AI planning tasks are embedded within narrative-centered gameplay structured around a Use-Modify-Create scaffolding progression. Further, we present results from a study of upper elementary students using the visual interface. We discuss how the Use-Modify-Create approach supported student learning as well as discuss the misconceptions and usability issues students encountered while using the visual interface to formulate AI planning tasks.}

abstract = {Zero–valent copper engineered nanoparticles (Cu–ENPs) released through unintentional or intentional actions into the agricultural soils can alter the availability of inorganic phosphorus (IP) to plants. In this study, we used adsorption–desorption experiments to evaluate the effect of particle size of 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) on IP availability in Santa Barbara (SB) volcanic ash soil. X–Ray Diffraction results showed that Cu–ENPs were formed by a mixture of Cu metallic and Cu oxides (Cu2O or/and CuO) species, while specific surface area values showed that Cu–ENPs/25 nm could form larger aggregate particles compared to Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm. The kinetic IP adsorption of SB soil without and with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) followed the mechanism described by the pseudo–second–order (k2 = 0.45–1.13 x 10−3 kg mmol−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.999, and RSS ≤ 0.091) and Elovich (α = 14621.10–3136.20 mmol kg−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.984, and RSS ≤ 69) models. Thus, the rate–limiting step for IP adsorption in the studied systems was chemisorption on a heterogeneous surface. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms without Cu–ENPs were fitted well to the Freundlich model, while with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm), isotherms were described best by the Freundlich and/or Langmuir model. The IP relative adsorption capacity (KF) was higher with 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm (KF = 110.41) than for 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm (KF = 74.40) and for SB soil (KF = 48.17). This study showed that plausible IP retention mechanisms in the presence of 1% Cu–ENPs in SB soil were: i) ligand exchange, ii) electrostatic attraction, and iii) co–precipitate formation. The desorption study demonstrated that 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm increased the affinity of IP in SB soil with a greater effect than 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm. Thus, both the studied size ranges of Cu–ENPs could favor an accumulation of IP in volcanic ash soils.}

According to the t-test results, teaching programming to primary school students in the code.org site did not cause any differences in reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. However, there is a slight increment in the means of female students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving over the males’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. On the other hand, qualitative data provided more information about the students’ experiences. Students developed a positive attitude towards programming, and female students showed that they were as successful as their male counterparts, and that programming could be part of their future plans.}

While this is a step in the right direction, it brings a new public health challenge into focus, namely psychological challenges associated with such chronic and often stigmatising condition in SA, home to the largest HIV epidemic. Given the current lack of national-level evidence, we investigated the role of the HIV epidemic on depression onset in SA using nationally representative panel data from the South African National Income Dynamics Study (SA-NIDS). Our incident cohort consisted of 13,020 sampled adult participants who were depression-free in Wave 4 (baseline year of 2015). We then measured the risk of depression onset in Wave 5 (year 2017) based on the level of HIV prevalence in the community where study participants resided at baseline. A High-resolution map of HIV spatial heterogeneity (i.e., community HIV prevalence) was generated using ordinary kriging mapping methods from a separate nationally representative data source that corresponded to the investigation period. Geospatial analyses were conducted to identify the spatial structure of HIV and depression onset, and generalised estimating equations (GEE) regression models were fitted to determine the risk of depression onset over time based on community HIV prevalence. Our geospatial analyses indicated that HIV and depression onset prevalence spatially overlapped in the eastern part of the country, particularly in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Free State province. The GEE regression analyses indicated that individual residency in a community with high HIV prevalence was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression than a low HIV prevalence community (adjusted odds ratio =1.45, 95% CI=1.12-1.48). For the first time, we identified a geospatial overlap between HIV and depression, with a greater risk of depression onset in high HIV prevalence communities, at a national scale in SA. There is a need for place-based policy interventions that prioritise the availability of and access to mental health services in high HIV prevalent SA communities, in an ageing HIV epidemic.}

Exploring the relationship between the Scratch project and its remix would provide a new perspective for understanding users’ creative behaviors. To this end, this study used 20 projects and their 957 remixes as samples to analyze creative behavior in Scratch through quantitative statistics and correlation analysis. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What creative levels are there among the remixes? (2) What relationships are there between the project and its remixes? and (3) What creative trends are there indicated in the remixes? The main results are concluded as follows. First, four creative levels of remixes based on the SOLO taxonomy are found, including feature change, appearance change, element creation, and structure creation. Feature change has the highest sum of remixes, which indicates that most remixes are at a low creative level. Second, the internal characteristics of projects are related to the lower creative level of remix, while the external characteristics are attached to the higher creative level of remix. Finally, the two-level, three-level, and four-level iteration chain of remixes are found, in which remixes with high creativity is more likely to inspire remixes with lower or equal creativity. Based on these results, suggestions for further research and improvement are discussed. This study has important implications for understanding the creative level of remix among users in programming community and guiding users to make valuable remixes.}

abstract = {We solve the gravitational field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime within the framework of the symmetric teleparallel theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive new solutions within the context of power-law f(Q) gravity and the nonmetricity scalar-tensor theory. For the connection in the non-coincidence gauge, we present the point-like Lagrangian that describes the employed field equations. Furthermore, we construct two conservation laws, and for different values of these conserved quantities, we analytically solve the gravitational field equations. New solutions are obtained, we investigate their physical properties and their general relativistic limit. Finally, we discuss the algebraic properties for the derived spacetimes.}

Although measurement is a central dimension of learning analytics, there has thus far been little research that examines links between learning analytics and assessment. This special issue of Computers in Human Behavior highlights 11 studies that explore how links between learning analytics and assessment can be strengthened. The contributions of these studies can be broadly grouped into three categories: analytics for assessment (learning analytic approaches as forms of assessment); analytics of assessment (applications of learning analytics to answer questions about assessment practices); and validity of measurement (conceptualization of and practical approaches to assuring validity in measurement in learning analytics). The findings of these studies highlight pressing scientific and practical challenges and opportunities in the connections between learning analytics and assessment that will require interdisciplinary teams to address: task design, analysis of learning progressions, trustworthiness, and fairness – to unlock the full potential of the links between learning analytics and assessment.}

Specifically, where the goal is to help individuals develop their understanding of computation and/or use computation in real world settings, we question whether natural language might be a preferred notation to traditional programming languages, given its familiarity and ubiquity. We describe three empirical studies investigating the use of natural language for computation in which we found that although natural language provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. We distilled our findings into a set of design guidelines for novice programming environments which consider the ways in which different notations, including natural language, can best support the various activities that comprise programming. These guidelines were embodied in Flip, a bi-modal programming language used in conjunction with the Electron toolset, which allows young people to create their own commercial quality, narrative based role- playing games. Two empirical studies on the use of Flip in three different real world contexts considered the extent to which the design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation. The guidelines have potential to be of use both in analysing the use of natural language in existing novice programming environments, and in the design of new ones.}

Computational data-centric research techniques play a prevalent and multi-disciplinary role in life science research. In the past, scientists in wet labs generated the data, and computational researchers focused on creating tools for the analysis of those data. Computational researchers are now becoming more independent and taking leadership roles within biomedical projects, leveraging the increased availability of public data. We are now able to generate vast amounts of data, and the challenge has shifted from data generation to data analysis. Here we discuss the pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities facing the field of data-centric research in biology. We discuss the evolving perception of computational data-driven research and its rise as an independent domain in biomedical research while also addressing the significant collaborative opportunities that arise from integrating computational research with experimental and translational biology. Additionally, we discuss the future of data-centric research and its applications across various areas of the biomedical field.}

We trained these algorithms on a dataset that we collected and curated, consisting of texts about and images of architecture. We describe our design process, present the final proposal, reflect on the usefulness of such tools for early-stage design, and discuss implications for future research and practice. By analysing the results from training the text-to-text generators we could establish a specific design brief that informed the final concept. The results from the image-to-image generator gave an overview of the shape grammars of previous submissions. All results were intriguing and can assist creativity and in this way, the tools were useful for gaining insight into historical architectural data, helped shape a specific design brief, and provoked new ideas. By reflecting on our design process, we argue that the use of language when employing such tools takes a new role and that three layers of language intertwined in our work: architectural discourse, programming languages, and annotations. We present a map that unfolds how these layers came together as a contribution to making machine learning more explainable for creatives.}

However, in a broader perspective, it can be crucial to consider the pervasiveness of technology, and the effect it can have not only on individuals but also on their peers in the context of diverse everyday-life situations. Within this view, which emphasises the social side of digital well-being, the paper argues the need of educating young generations to participate in the making of technology for a social goal and have a reflective attitude towards technology and its impact on society. It, therefore, presents a design toolkit as a means to (i) engage young generations to become active in design for social digital well-being and, thanks to the exposure to how technology works, (ii) reflect deeply on the pros and cons of technology in use in their everyday life. By presenting the results of a study with 24 high-school pupils and their teachers, the paper discusses how a phygital toolkit, which structures the design process, engages them in the rapid prototyping of their own smart things, and how it acts as a proxy for soliciting their own reflections around technology and social digital well-being.}

To address these issues, this study proposed a Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model by applying design thinking (DT). The DT process for the Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model was first constructed in terms of applying Action Design Research (ADR). In addition, primary issues of Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design were identified by applying Empathize Map and Delphi Method. The prototype for Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design was then obtained through brainstorming, Adobe Experience Design, and so on. Moreover, the application of this Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model was conducted with developing a Xinjiang brocade innovative design system, and it was validated. The results show the effectiveness of the Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model, which not only organizes the knowledge and product information of existing Xinjiang brocades but also facilitates innovative customization, thereby enhancing user satisfaction.}

This study adopts the theoretical lens of New Literacy studies to suggest a combined perspective for investigating social media literacies. This perspective considers both social media skills that are transversal across different social media (global skills), and those that pertain to a specific social media platform (local skills). It examines practices that are decontextualized (literacy as something to be acquired), and those that are situated and context-dependent (literacy through participation). To map current research on social media skills, a systematic literature review was conducted. Analysis of 54 publications was carried out following the UNESCO DLGF framework for digital literacy competencies, and also using a critical lens based on four metaphors whereby, for learning purposes, social media are seen as a tool, as a process, as collaboration, and as participation. The results show that most of the studies consider global social media skills, while only a few examine skills sets specific to a particular social media platform. In addition, most of the identified skills concern decontextualized practices, with very few studies emphasizing the importance of fostering situated social media practices. We conclude that there is a need for more expansive theoretical elaboration in the field, and provide a number of recommendations for investigating, understanding, and designing educational curricula and activities that support the development of social media literacy.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has been the focus of significant attention in recent years because of its growing social importance and pedagogical value. In Hong Kong, an increasing number of K-12 schools are planning or piloting their grassroots AIED incorporation practices. However, progress is reportedly slow due to a number of barriers. Unfortunately, because of their limited scope, disputed interpretations and contextual irrelevance, current research literature seems to be of limited referencing value in aiding schools to address the issues and overcome the barriers. This paper highlights the necessity of embracing AIED as wide-ranging given the current understanding of it as a collective notion. Three major directions of AIED are identified: Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI. A collective case study, which examined the perceived barriers to AIED incorporation in Hong Kong K-12 schools with different AIED directions, was conducted. Qualitative data were gathered via ten semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from two schools. Ertmer’s (1999) typology was applied to segregate the barriers. The findings showed that both first-order and second-order barriers existed, although they varied between the cases. It was also found that the barriers did not hinder in isolation but appeared to be interconnected. The findings suggest that schools use differentiated strategies to tackle barriers according to their approach to incorporating AIED. Moreover, there is a need to trace the links between barriers and prioritise school efforts to remove or reduce them with high linkage. Several recommendations for practice are given.}

However, the uneven quality of campus culture teaching is also increasingly exposed. Therefore, we propose a set of campus culture intelligent quality assessment feedback system driven by data and knowledge. Based on real multi-modal campus culture data, the evaluation system covers different online teaching forms, and can comprehensively consider and measure the core elements of quality evaluation from the perspective of teachers and students, so as to achieve accurate evaluation and feedback of campus culture. This paper proposes to combine emotion computing with big data analysis, construct a theoretical framework of multi-modal emotion analysis from the perspective of multi-spatial fusion, and explore the students' learning emotion recognition and intelligent assessment based on multi-modal data fusion. By studying the key issues, logical path and implementation path of multimodal learning emotion analysis in campus culture, this paper reveals the mechanism of student emotion development from the perspective of campus culture, expands the intervention practice of student group emotion, and provides technical support and action guidance for after-school teaching and research on campus culture.}

abstract = {This article presents the results of a study conducted in collaboration with two universities – one in Lapland (Finland) and the other in Hong Kong (China) – during the development of an international university course on global media education. The objective of the study was to examine international students’ changing conceptual understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy as part of the course. The need for this study arose from the recent rapid spread of AI across industries, which has connected human learning to machine learning. This requires competence in AI to contribute to future society. Five hours of online lectures on AI literacy were delivered during two workshops to students (N = 29) from 13 countries with no or limited prior knowledge of the subject in 2021 and 2022. The participants filled out pre- and post-workshop quantitative questionnaires and wrote diaries about their learning process, the development of their understanding of AI-literacy concepts, and their thoughts on the pedagogical approaches used. The quantitative data were analysed using a paired-samples t-test, while the qualitative data were examined using thematic-content analysis. The findings show that the students’ knowledge of AI and their awareness of the importance of AI literacy and media education increased significantly. Further research is needed so that a more appropriate curriculum can be designed for them. We outline some key activities that offer interactive and participatory ways to learn AI in order to assist educators in planning and delivering AI-literacy courses as part of cross-cultural media education.}

abstract = {Research suggests that children can learn educational concepts from well-designed applications (apps), including foundational science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) concepts. Parents may be important for promoting children's STEM learning from touchscreen apps, as parents can help their children learn from other media. However, little research has explored how parents and children use coding apps together for learning, and whether specific parent-child interactions in these contexts promote children's learning from apps. Therefore, we observed 31 parents and their 4.5- to 5.0-year old children playing a coding app together and coded for spatial talk, question-asking, task-relevant talk, and responsiveness. Results show that parents and children engaged in high-quality interactions during coding app play, with parents and children exhibiting high responsiveness and task-relevant talk, and parents exhibiting a higher proportion of question-asking and spatial talk compared to their children. Importantly, linear regression analyses show that the dyad's ability to stay on task during the coding task predicts children's learning of coding, while question-asking was a negative predictor of children's learning. These results suggest that coding apps may be a rich context for STEM learning, and that specific parent-child interactions can scaffold their children's learning from STEM apps.}

abstract = {Science consists of a body of knowledge and a set of processes by which the knowledge is produced. Although these have traditionally been treated separately in science instruction, there has been a shift to an integration of knowledge and processes, or set of practices, in how science should be taught and assessed. We explore whether a general overall mastery of the processes drives learning in new science content areas and if this overall mastery can be improved through engaged science learning. Through a review of literature, the paper conceptualizes this general process mastery as scientific sensemaking, defines the sub-dimensions, and presents a new measure of the construct centered in scenarios of general interest to young adolescents. Using a dataset involving over 2500 6th and 8th grade students, the paper shows that scientific sensemaking scores can predict content learning gains and that this relationship is consistent across student characteristics, content of instruction, and classroom environment. Further, students who are behaviorally and cognitively engaged during science classroom activities show greater growth in scientific sensemaking, showing a reciprocal relationship between sensemaking ability and effective science instruction. Findings from this work support early instruction on sensemaking activities to better position students to learn new scientific content.}

In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. We are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum.}

Traditional manual grading is time-consuming, often inconsistent, and prone to subjective biases. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) for the automated evaluation of programming assignments. LLMs can use advanced natural language processing capabilities to assess code quality, functionality, and adherence to best practices, providing detailed feedback and grades. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs through experiments comparing their performance with human evaluators across various programming tasks. Our study evaluates the performance of several LLMs for automated grading. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves an exact match accuracy of 86% and a ±1 accuracy of 98%. GPT-4o also demonstrates strong performance, with exact match and ±1 accuracies of 69% and 97%, respectively. Both models correlate highly with human evaluations, indicating their potential for reliable automated grading. However, models such as Llama 3 70B and Mixtral 8 × 7B exhibit low accuracy and alignment with human grading, particularly in problem-solving tasks. These findings suggest that advanced LLMs are instrumental in scalable, automated educational assessment. Additionally, LLMs enhance the learning experience by offering personalized, instant feedback, fostering an iterative learning process. The findings suggest that LLMs could play a pivotal role in the future of programming education, ensuring scalability and consistency in evaluation.}

Although the significance of critical thinking in primary education has been discussed in many studies, the number of studies conducted on the subject is limited. This study aims to systematically review and analyse the literature by taking a holistic approach to previous studies in order to clearly identify the gaps in the field and the steps to be taken for future studies. In this context, two different analysis methods were employed in the study. This review aims to reveal information that has not been fully captured or evaluated previously, including information related to important sources, documents, countries, and keywords used in the field. According to the results obtained from the study, the country with the highest publication performance is the United States of America, and the most cited publication source is the Journal of Thinking Skills and Creativity. The most frequently studied concepts in the documents are identified as 21st century skills, assessment, creativity, learning, teaching, teacher, education, and primary school. Another result obtained reveals that articles on critical thinking, which increased between 2015 and 2020, mostly discussed critical thinking in the fields of mathematics and science education. Studies that examine the development of critical thinking skills through the implementation of different teaching methods are particularly in the majority. According to the analysis results of the article methodologies, it is revealed that the majority are based on the qualitative research approach, the criterion sampling method is used with small sample groups, and the most preferred data collection tool is the document. In addition to revealing the current status regarding the research tendencies of critical thinking in primary education, these results have the potential to guide researchers, countries and primary school teachers working in the field.}

abstract = {Using computational methods to produce and interpret multiple scientific representations is now a common practice in many science disciplines. Research has shown students have difficulty in moving across, connecting, and sensemaking from multiple representations. There is a need to develop task-specific representational competencies for students to reason and conduct scientific investigations using multiple representations. In this study, we focus on three representational competencies: 1) linking between representations, 2) disciplinary sensemaking from multiple representations, and 3) conceptualizing domain-relevant content derived from multiple representations. We developed a block code-based computational modeling environment with three different representations and embedded it within an online activity for students to carry out investigations around the earthquake cycle. The three representations include a procedural representation of block codes, a geometric representation of land deformation build-up, and a graphical representation of deformation build-up over time. We examined the extent of students' representational competencies and which competencies are most correlated with students’ future performance in a computationally supported geoscience investigation. Results indicate that a majority of the 431 students showed at least some form of representational competence. However, a relatively small number of students showed sophisticated levels of linking, sensemaking, and conceptualizing from the representations. Five of seven representational competencies, the most prominent being code sensemaking (η2 = 0.053, p < 0.001), were significantly correlated to student performance on a summative geoscience investigation.}

To understand the stratification of the net into the surface Web and the hidden Web, a model structure is proposed that provides navigation through the net as a whole. For logical expressions, a relativized evaluation map is given, which is parameterized by the indexing system. It is allowed to use concepts that are generated using partial functions, the variables of which run over the range of possible individual information processes. A generalized operator providing virtualization is presented for individuals. The process is accompanied with the dynamic generation of Web-pages, which triggers their indexing. This way they are thereby transferred to the surface layer of the network. A commutative diagram is proposed that establishes a cognitive model of semantic constructions of variable domains, the connection of virtual individuals with actual ones which corresponds to transitions over the stages of knowledge. The knowledge stages are modeled by indexing systems.}

However, gender segregation in higher education in this sector is creating a gender gap that means that for some disciplines female representation does not even reach 30% of the total. In order to propose measures to address the phenomenon, it is necessary to understand the possible causes of this issue. A systematic literature review and mapping were carried out for the study, following the PRISMA guidelines and flowchart. The research questions to be answered were (RQ1) What studies exist on the gender gap in relation to the choice of higher education in the STEM field; and (RQ2) How do gender roles and stereotypes influence decision-making related to higher education? The review of peer-reviewed scientific articles, conferences texts, books and book chapters on the European education area was applied. A total of 4571 initial results were obtained and, after the process marked by the PRISMA flowchart, the final results were reduced to 26. The results revealed that gender stereotypes are strong drivers of the gender gap in general, and the Leaky Pipeline and Stereotype Threat in particular. To narrow the gender gap, it is necessary to focus on influences from the family, the educational environment, and the peer group, as well as from the culture itself. Positive self-concept, self-efficacy, self-confidence, and self-perception need to be fostered, so that the individual chooses their studies according to their goals.}

The two co-robots are: (1) a Glider for Underwater Problem-solving and Promotion of Interest in Engineering or GUPPIE and (2) a Neurally controlled manipulator called Neu-pulator. The co-robots are easy and inexpensive to manufacture, with readily available lightweight and durable components. They are also modular to accommodate a variety of learning activities that help young students to learn crosscutting concepts and engineering practice. The early assessment results show that students’ interests in activities related to robotics depend on their perception of the difficulty and their confidence level. The key is to start early when the students are young. The challenge is to break the barriers and define tasks as fun activities with a learn and play approach that can be rewarding. In this work, using a meaningful context – as in co-robots that help humans – in a hands-on project-based program that integrates different aspect of design, science, and technology is found effective in increasing students’ enthusiasm and participation. The co-robots and the hands-on activities can be easily adopted in classrooms by teachers with no engineering background who seek innovative ways to connect interdisciplinary core ideas and standards to the concepts they need to teach.}

abstract = {With the advancement of technology, emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) have also been growing rapidly and becoming more common than ever before. Kenya has taken tremendous steps in adopting the use of emerging technology in different sectors of the economy. In realization of the need to have a skilled digital workforce to develop solutions using these emerging technologies, Kenya has undertaken curriculum reforms and introduced the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) which has included digital literacy and coding in elementary school. Furthermore, computer science has been introduced in Junior Secondary School. In view of these changes, teachers should be adequately prepared with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to effectively teach these new technologies. However, in Kenya, AI was not and still is not part of the teacher training curriculum. Additionally, there are inadequate professional development opportunities in AI for both pre-service and in-service teachers since AI is not part of the CBC curriculum. That notwithstanding, it is inevitable for teachers in the current world to introduce AI to learners. Therefore, this study's objectives were to assess the confidence in AI, attitudes toward AI, AI ethics, subjective norms, perceived threats, and the readiness to teach AI among Kenyan K-12 in-service teachers and to assess how these factors influence their readiness to teach AI. To achieve these objectives, this study employed a quantitative research methodology by administering a survey using Google Forms to a random sample of 308 teachers from different grades from 37 out of 47 counties in Kenya. The findings showed that confidence in AI, AI ethics and subjective norms significantly influenced AI readiness while attitude towards AI and perceived threats did not significantly influence AI readiness. These results are significant in providing a basis for education policy change on AI education in Kenya, such as transforming the teacher training curriculum to include AI and designing AI professional development programs for in-service teachers to ensure they are well-equipped to teach AI.}

abstract = {Visual diagrammatic programming and block diagrams have been indispensable tools for systems modeling and simulation across research, development, and educational fields for several decades. Despite the availability of mature commercial and free software tools, there is a lack of information publicly accessible on algorithms for processing block diagrams that represent dynamical systems and simulate the corresponding models. A gap in the existing literature is the absence of mathematically formal and complete proposals of algorithms for processing block diagrams that are multigraphs containing directed cyclic graphs, and not just simpler directed graphs. The lack of a detailed exposition concerning the practical implementation of such algorithms is also a gap. This gap is likely because the simulation systems based on block diagram descriptions that have become de facto industry standards use proprietary solutions, even if their origins can be traced back to work done in research centers and universities more than seven decades ago. In response to these challenges, this paper summarizes the historical evolution of related paradigms, such as data flow diagrams, signal flow graphs, bond graphs, and block diagrams. We propose a general algorithm for block diagram processing and present an open-source software tool for Python that implements a diagrammatic visual programming interface and the proposed block diagram processing algorithm. The key contributions to the field of systems modeling and simulation can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the exposition of the algorithm formally proving its correctness, offers transparency which facilitates further research and development in the field, enabling academics and professionals to adapt, enhance, or expand upon the existing capabilities of the tool. Secondly, the implementation of a Python library and tool released as an open-source solution for simulating signal processing and dynamical systems through block diagrams by integrating the proposed algorithm capable of efficiently handling multigraph representations, including those with directed cyclic graphs. Ensuring accessibility of the tool to researchers, developers, and educators fosters innovation, research and empowers educators by providing them with a versatile tool that can be used to teach complex systems modeling and simulation concepts in a practical, hands-on manner across various domains, such as control systems, electrical engineering, and computer science.}

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 evolution in specific geographies may help predict properties of the variants that come from these regions. We mapped neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain that evolved over 6 months from ancestral virus in a person with advanced HIV disease in South Africa; this person was infected prior to emergence of the Beta and Delta variants. We longitudinally tracked the evolved virus and tested it against self-plasma and convalescent plasma from ancestral, Beta, and Delta infections. Early virus was similar to ancestral, but it evolved a multitude of mutations found in Omicron and other variants. It showed substantial but incomplete Pfizer BNT162b2 escape, weak neutralization by self-plasma, and despite pre-dating Delta, it also showed extensive escape of Delta infection-elicited neutralization. This example is consistent with the notion that SARS-CoV-2 evolving in individual immune-compromised hosts, including those with advanced HIV disease, may gain immune escape of vaccines and enhanced escape of Delta immunity, and this has implications for vaccine breakthrough and reinfections.}

With their history of working with the socially disadvantaged, NGOs have a unique role in clarifying the nature of demand since social innovation must often address ill-formulated “wicked problems”. Similarly, NGOs can fill the “institutional voids” which limit socioeconomic transactions in the Global South. The paper discusses the wicked nature of visual-impairment, which is both widely prevalent and has biopsychosocial attributes i.e., the functional limitations are reinforced by the psychological perceptions of the blind and visually impaired (BVI), and the sociological stigma of impairment. The empirical setting is India where policies for the BVI population are being formulated within a broader framework of social inclusion. The paper investigates how the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB) has taken advantage of state policies to embrace an academic mandate which includes social innovation. Specifically, it explores IIITB's incubation of the NGO Vision Empower, and the partnership that has followed, to overcome the neglect of the BVI in science and mathematics education.}

abstract = {Background
eHealth is the use of information and communication technologies to enable and improve health and health care services. It is crucial that medical students receive adequate training in eHealth as they will work in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. This trend is especially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it complicates traditional face-to-face medical consultations and highlights the need for innovative approaches in health care.
Objective
This review aims to evaluate the extent and nature of the existing literature on medical student training in eHealth. In detail, it aims to examine what this education consists of, the barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum. This review focuses primarily on some key technologies such as mobile health (mHealth), the internet of things (IoT), telehealth, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Methods
Searches were performed on 4 databases, and articles were selected based on the eligibility criteria. Studies had to be related to the training of medical students in eHealth. The eligibility criteria were studies published since 2014, from a peer-reviewed journal, and written in either English or French. A grid was used to extract and chart data.
Results
The search resulted in 25 articles. The most studied aspect was mHealth. eHealth as a broad concept, the IoT, AI, and programming were least covered. A total of 52% (13/25) of all studies contained an intervention, mostly regarding mHealth, electronic health records, web-based medical resources, and programming. The findings included various barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum.
Conclusions
Trends have emerged regarding the suboptimal present state of eHealth training and barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for optimal training. We recommend that additional studies be conducted on the following themes: barriers, enhancing factors, propositions for optimal training, competencies that medical students should acquire, learning outcomes from eHealth training, and patient care outcomes from this training. Additional studies should be conducted on eHealth and each of its aspects, especially on the IoT, AI, programming, and eHealth as a broad concept. Training in eHealth is critical to medical practice in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. The need for innovative approaches in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlights the relevance of this training.}

Gamification has been used successfully to promote various desired health behaviors. Previous studies have used gamification to achieve desired health behaviors or facilitate their learning about health.
Objective
In this scoping review, we aimed to describe digital gamified tools that have been implemented or evaluated across various populations to encourage vaccination, as well as any reported effects of identified tools.
Methods
We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Web of Science Core Collection, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Academic Search Premier, PsycInfo, Global Health, and ERIC for peer-reviewed papers describing digital gamified tools with or without evaluations. We also conducted web searches with Google to identify digital gamified tools lacking associated publications. We consulted 12 experts in the field of gamification and health behavior to identify any papers or tools we might have missed. We extracted data about the target population of the tools, the interventions themselves (eg, type of digital gamified tool platform, type of disease/vaccine, type and design of study), and any effects of evaluated tools, and we synthesized data narratively.
Results
Of 1402 records, we included 28 (2%) peer-reviewed papers and 10 digital gamified tools lacking associated publications. The experts added 1 digital gamified tool that met the inclusion criteria. Our final data set therefore included 28 peer-reviewed papers and 11 digital gamified tools. Of the 28 peer-reviewed papers, 7 (25%) explained the development of the tool, 16 (57%) described evaluation, and 2 (7%) reported both development and evaluation of the tool. The 28 peer-reviewed papers reported on 25 different tools. Of these 25 digital gamified tools, 11 (44%) were web-based tools, 8 (32%) mobile (native mobile or mobile-enabled web) apps, and 6 (24%) virtual reality tools. Overall, tools that were evaluated showed increases in knowledge and intentions to receive vaccines, mixed effects on attitudes, and positive effects on beliefs. We did not observe discernible advantages of one type of digital gamified tool (web based, mobile, virtual reality) over the others. However, a few studies were randomized controlled trials, and publication bias may have led to such positive effects having a higher likelihood of appearing in the peer-reviewed literature.
Conclusions
Digital gamified tools appear to have potential for improving vaccine uptake by fostering positive beliefs and increasing vaccine-related knowledge and intentions. Encouraging comparative studies of different features or different types of digital gamified tools could advance the field by identifying features or types of tools that yield more positive effects across populations and contexts. Further work in this area should seek to inform the implementation of gamification for vaccine acceptance and promote effective health communication, thus yielding meaningful health and social impacts.}

This systematic literature review and meta-analysis explores whether and how ChatGPT impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. We used the PRISMA method to select, analyze, and report the results. We screened 766 articles from four databases and identified 17 empirical studies with 1735 students for analysis. We compared the effect on student engagement between ChatGPT-based and non-ChatGPT learning. We found a medium effect size on overall student engagement in ChatGPT-based learning in the random effects model. Our analyses further suggest that ChatGPT-based learning is more effective in fostering student behavioral (medium effective size), cognitive (large effective size), and emotional engagement (medium effective size) than non-ChatGPT learning. Our findings revealed ChatGPT is an effective tool for engaging students in learning. We also suggested three roles ChatGPT plays in fostering student engagement: personalized tutoring, programming and technical assistance, and content generation and collaboration. Our systematic literature review revealed potential risks and results in student disengagement, such as over-reliance.}

The aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. A mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a Mechanical Engineering Master's program at a Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students' grades. Results show that students used ChatGPT for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. While students reported advantages of using ChatGPT, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. Furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from ChatGPT usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. The findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of AI tools. Complex programming assignments remain appropriate in programming education, but pair programming as a didactic approach should be reconsidered in light of the growing use of AI Chatbots.}

The maker culture can be described as a philosophy in which individuals or groups of individuals create artifacts that are recreated and assembled using software and/or physical objects. Typical topics of interest in maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as electronics, robotics, 3D printing, and computer numerical control tools, as well as more traditional activities such as sewing or arts and crafts. Scholars and educators have reported a variety of outcomes from the Maker Movement as an instructional process; however, the lack of a summary of these empirical studies prevents stakeholders from having a clear view of the benefits and challenges of this instructional culture. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the Maker Movement approach in order to summarize the current findings and guide future studies. Forty-three peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. The results of this survey show the direction of Maker Movement research during recent years and the most common technologies, subjects, evaluation methods, and pedagogical designs. Suggestions for future research include a further investigation into the benefits of using a specific technological tool and analysis of the Maker Movement approach, particularly in classrooms. These future research efforts will allow us to better indicate which aspects and ingredients of “making” work better for which circumstances and student groups. The findings will ultimately allow us to form best practices and a unified framework for guiding/assisting educators who want to adopt this teaching style.}

Twenty-five types of assessment approaches were employed to examine these outcomes and to identify the assessment characteristics. The results indicate that a consideration of the assessment of learning outcomes at the beginning of course design could support the formulation of explicit assessment goals and, in this way, instruct learners to work toward learning outcomes. A combination of knowledge tests and skill tasks can be used to examine cognitive outcomes in a particular MOOC. Outcome-oriented feedback rubrics are beneficial to support learner essay performance and interpretations of the utilization of rubrics could better guide providers to give peer feedback. A variety of behavioral and affective outcomes reflect multiple aspects of participant learning in MOOCs, which might contribute to better understanding by teachers and the provision of learning support. Furthermore, assessment tasks throughout the course may differ in difficulty and complexity, which could align with different levels of learner motivation. The findings provide a holistic picture of learning outcomes and related assessment instruments in current MOOCs. Curriculum designers and teachers could benefit from this study to consider appropriate learning outcome variables and instruments to apply in their MOOC practices. Future research might investigate the motivation of learners to participate in a MOOC and how this changes during a MOOC. This could help MOOC designers and teachers to align how learners are motivated, what they want to learn, and what they actually do learn.}

We developed an online educational game designed to enhance core media and information literacy competencies and to help young adults become information literate citizens. We examined the game's effects on skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills, two of the most important MIL competencies. In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. Before treatment, the participants' perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. After treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. The results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). In addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. These findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource. We extend our discussion to the advantages and limitations of games in fostering learners' abilities to evaluate online information.}

A class of systems named “enactive” aims to support fluid interaction between technology and people via feedback cycles — the effect of technology on the human agent is fed back by the human action on the technology — based on the use of data sensors. We have extended this concept in a long-term project on socioenactive systems, by emphasizing social aspects in the enactive phenomena. In this article, we investigate how a robot-based experience can promote social behavior among children in an educational context. The study was conducted in workshops with 26 children (4–5 years old), organized in two groups. The system scenario used a narrative based on an adaptation of the Little Red Riding Hood tale to investigate children's interaction in playing embodied-based situations. Data captured from video-recorded workshop sessions were analyzed post hoc using the Grounded Theory methods. In total, 26 interaction coding were identified, with a high interrater reliability assessed by Cohen's Kappa (k = 0.84). Our findings indicate that 50.5% of the children's actions were the result of children-children and group-robot interactions, compared to the 38% of children interacting individually with the robot. This indicates children's high degree of embodied peer collaboration and initiative to accomplish the tasks in the proposed scenario. These results contribute to inform the design and construction of future socioenactive systems.}

Self-determination theory (SDT) can explain student engagement from the needs satisfaction perspective. Therefore, this project aimed to investigate how SDT-based needs support by teachers and student attributes (gender and achievement level) affect AI learning at secondary school level. It adopted a two-study design, with each study using a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design with student needs support from teachers as one factor and one of the student attributes as the other: gender in Study 1 and achievement level in Study 2. In both studies, there were two groups – SDT-based (teacher needs support) and control (without). The analyses revealed that in the SDT-based program, (1) the students had a more positive perception of AI learning and felt that their needs were satisfied, and (2) there were non-significant differences in AI learning between boys and girls and between high and low achievers. The findings suggest that a focus on needs satisfaction could engage boys and girls, and high and low achievers in AI learning. As they become more engaged, they are likely to gain more confidence, feel that the content is more relevant, and become intrinsically motivated to pursue further AI learning.}

Bibliometric Analyzes (BAs), however, provide researchers with an overview through Co-occurrence Networks (CNs), Strategic Diagrams (SDs), Thematic Subnetworks (TSs), and Thematic Evolution Diagrams (TEDs). Nevertheless, their use in SWD research has been limited, with minimal attention given to them. Thus, we created a bibliometric dataset, compared it with other BAs, and developed CNs, SDs, TSs, and a TED for SWD. Furthermore, key term searches (Energy, Solar, Reverse Osmosis, Modeling and Optimization, Membrane Distillation, Environmental, Economics, Fouling, Nanofiltration, and Ultrafiltration) and their literature are discussed. Geographical analysis shows China and the US lead SWD research, shifting from process design to membrane fabrication and solar energy. Furthermore, RO remains the leading technique despite high energy demands. Solar desalination shows promise but faces cost and scalability challenges. Environmental and economic concerns are discussed, as well as emerging solutions regarding, solar desalination, blue energy, “blue carbon”, and zero liquid discharge.

However, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the perception of ChatGPT, specifically among design students. This study aimed to understand the product design (PD) and user experience design (UXD) students' views on ChatGPT and focused on an Indian university. The study employed a survey research design, utilizing questionnaires as the primary data collection method. The collected data (n = 149) was analyzed using descriptive statistics (i.e., frequency, percentage, average, and standard deviation (SD). Inferential statistics (i.e., one-way ANOVA) was used to understand the significant differences between the programs of study, gender, and academic level. The findings indicate that the students expressed admiration for the capabilities of ChatGPT and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool for their studies. In addition, the students' motivation towards using ChatGPT was moderate. Furthermore, the study observed significant differences between PD and UXD students and differences based on gender and academic level on certain variables. Notably, UXD students reported that ChatGPT does not understand their questions well, and formulating effective prompts for the tool was more challenging than for PD students. Based on the findings, the study recommends how educators should consider integrating ChatGPT into design education curricula and pedagogical practices. The insights aim to contribute to refining the use of ChatGPT in educational settings and exploring avenues for improving its effectiveness, ultimately advancing the field of AI in design education.}

Drawing on concepts of teacher agency and learner agency, and viewed through a figurational sociology lens, this paper explored the realities of teaching LCCS and the role teacher agency and learner agency played in such enactment. Through a case study design, four teachers were interviewed in a focus group semi-structured manner. To delve deeper into the pedagogical approaches used in LCCS, a further one teacher and their nine students were interviewed. The findings highlight an influential relationship (positive and negative, encouraging and discouraging) between teachers’ agentic decisions in their process of achieving teacher agency and the students process of achieving learner agency. The paper offers a figurational viewpoint of the relationship between teacher agency and learner agency through a constructed Figure. We explicitly argue that the responsibility should not be placed on the teacher and student in achieving agency (as a product) but it is a combination of the teacher and the students and the other interdependent relationships within their figurations, alongside contextual factors, and educational social processes, which determine the fluctuation of the process of achieving teacher and learner agency. The paper provides considerations for computer science teacher education.}

Gender has been consistently controlled as a variable in usability and playability tests. However, there is no consensus on whether and how gender differences should influence the design of digital environments. According to some research, digital environments may be unintentionally designed especially for males as a result of the existing gender biases which risks reproducing gender-polarized culture in a computational field. This study attempts to highlight that females are still being negatively affected by existing gender stereotypes and prescribed gender identities despite relatively equal access and use of computer technology. This qualitative study aims to provide insights about the first-time user experience in a home environment of 16 middle school children in Turkey (8 males - 8 females), aged between 11 and 14 years, with a code learning game named “Code Combat”. The analysis is supported with complementary quantitative findings. The present study investigates the participants' conceptualizations and opinions toward coding concept and this specific coding game. Further, it explores how existing gender stereotypes and gender biased expectations impact their behaviors and attitudes in the context of game experience. Our results indicated that perceived computer competence and perceived coding difficulty had important effects on the participants’ performance relatedly with their gender identity. According to our findings, there are important gender differences to be found in our 9 constructs, namely; perceived computer competence, perceived coding difficulty, identification, perceived game difficulty, perceived success, level of enjoyment, level of anxiety, the likelihood of playing it another time and the likelihood of trying new features.}

The predictors are Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Technological Collaboration Knowledge (TCoK), and Attitudes. These constructs are measured by newly developed self-assessment instruments. Structural equation modeling using a sample of 212 in-service teachers from commercial schools in German-speaking Switzerland lend support to the soundness of the measurement instrument and the conceptual framework. Overall, 36% of the variance of the use of technology as a means and 45% of the variance for the use as the content of instruction can be explained. Mediation and multigroup analyses, a finite-mixture segmentation, comparisons of competing models, and factor score regression yielded evidence for the robustness of the conceptual framework.}

abstract = {Objective
The utility of biomedical information retrieval environments can be severely limited when users lack expertise in constructing effective search queries. To address this issue, we developed a computer-based query recommendation algorithm that suggests semantically interchangeable terms based on an initial user-entered query. In this study, we assessed the value of this approach, which has broad applicability in biomedical information retrieval, by demonstrating its application as part of a search engine that facilitates retrieval of information from electronic health records (EHRs).
Materials and Methods
The query recommendation algorithm utilizes MetaMap to identify medical concepts from search queries and indexed EHR documents. Synonym variants from UMLS are used to expand the concepts along with a synonym set curated from historical EHR search logs. The empirical study involved 33 clinicians and staff who evaluated the system through a set of simulated EHR search tasks. User acceptance was assessed using the widely used technology acceptance model.
Results
The search engine’s performance was rated consistently higher with the query recommendation feature turned on vs. off. The relevance of computer-recommended search terms was also rated high, and in most cases the participants had not thought of these terms on their own. The questions on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use received overwhelmingly positive responses. A vast majority of the participants wanted the query recommendation feature to be available to assist in their day-to-day EHR search tasks.
Discussion and Conclusion
Challenges persist for users to construct effective search queries when retrieving information from biomedical documents including those from EHRs. This study demonstrates that semantically-based query recommendation is a viable solution to addressing this challenge.}

abstract = {Information and communication technology (ICT) have become indispensable in contemporary schools in post-industrialized countries. Whether schools have succeeded in vesting students with the needed digital skills important in today's highly digitalized societal landscape however remains unclear. In this paper, we examine whether school resources in terms of ICT infrastructure, use of ICT in education, and availability of technical expertise are pertinent to students' digital skillfulness. We also investigate whether such school ICT resources are unevenly distributed among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether students of different socioeconomic backgrounds unevenly benefit from these resources. In doing so, we illuminate school ICT resources' role in the process of intergenerational transmission of inequalities. To test our expectations, we employ ICILS 2018 data on 14,183 students in 751 schools across seven OECD countries. Our findings indicate that schools indeed play a meaningful role in nurturing digital skills, namely through students' use of ICT in educational tasks. We also find that students from more advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds more often attend well ICT-resourced schools, pointing at the uneven distribution of school ICT resources in a way that reflects social reproduction processes. Alongside that, the availability of technical expertise in schools seems particularly fruitful for low-SES students' digital skills development. This evinces that schools compensate for limited ICT skills socialization in the family, pointing at social mobility processes.}

abstract = {Understanding the variation patterns of tunnel boring machine (TBM) operational parameters is crucial for assessing engineering geological conditions and quality grades of surrounding rock within tunnels. Studying the multifractal characteristics of the TBM operational parameters can help identify the patterns, but the relevant research has not yet been explored. This paper proposed a novel classification model for quality grades of surrounding rock in TBM tunnels based on multifractal analysis theory. Initially, the statistical characteristics of eight TBM cycle data with different grades of surrounding rock were explored. Subsequently, the method of calculating and analyzing the multifractal characteristic parameters of the TBM operational data was deduced and summarized. The research results showed that the TBM operational parameters of cutterhead torque, total thrust, advance rate, and cutterhead rotation speed have significant multifractal characteristics. Its multifractal dimension, midpoint slope of the generalized fractal spectrum, and singularity strength range can be used to evaluate the surrounding rock grades of the tunnel. Finally, a novel classification model for the tunnel surrounding rocks based on the multifractal characteristic parameters was proposed using the multiple linear regression method, and the model was verified through four TBM cycle data containing different surrounding rock grades. The results showed that the proposed multifractal-based classification model for tunnel surrounding rocks has high accuracy and applicability. This study not only achieves multifractal feature representation and surrounding rock classification for TBM operational parameters but also holds the potential for adaptive adjustment of TBM operational parameters and automated tunneling applications.}

CoDeT aims to scaffold children's collaboration and design thinking in co-design settings characterised by a high child-to-adult ratio (ca. 1 adult for 15 to 20 children), such as schools, museums and maker spaces. In these settings, children have to work relatively independent from adults who become guides on the side. This can be challenging due to children's limited understanding of the design process and their lack of skills to collaborate productively towards a shared design goal. CoDeT addresses these challenges by integrating principles of Social Interdependence Theory (SIT) and Design Thinking (DT), which together form the theoretical backbone of the approach. CoDeT was first applied in a case study and yielded promising results in terms of children's collaboration and design thinking skills, yet possible improvements were found. The insights of this case study informed the revised version of CoDeT presented at the end of this article, in a what-why-how structure, allowing researchers and practitioners to apply the co-design approach in a wide variety of contexts characterised by high child-to-adult ratios.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of modern society, extending digital transformation to daily life and psychological evaluation and treatment. However, the development of competencies and literacy in handling digital technology has not kept pace, resulting in a significant disparity among individuals. Existing measurements of digital literacy were developed before widespread information and communications technology device adoption, mainly focusing on one’s perceptions of their proficiency and the utility of device operation. In the contemporary landscape, digital transformation is evolving within specialized domains, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of digital competencies, attitudes, and proficiency in technology application to bridge the digital divide and ensure digital compliance.
Objective
This study was designed to address the shortcomings of existing scales and formulate a digital sensitivity scale tailored to the requirements of today’s society.
Methods
Initial items of the Yongin Severance Digital Sensitivity Scale (YI-DSS) were collected through a literature review, and expert opinions were gathered to ensure content validity. An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis included 986 adult participants evaluating 14 digital literacy items and 6 digital efficacy items. The Cronbach α confirmed internal consistency reliability, and 2-tailed t tests, ANOVAs, and post hoc tests analyzed demographic differences in digital literacy and efficacy.
Results
A robust 4-factor digital literacy solution was identified: digital application, digital communication, critical thinking, and digital ethics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.891; Bartlett × 2=9829.713; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.782-0.947). A 2-factor solution defined digital efficacy: digital confidence and digital anxiety (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.735; Bartlett × 2=3282.217; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.787-0.912). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for each model (digital literacy model: χ271=676.0, comparative fit index=0.938, Tucker-Lewis index=0.921, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.093; digital efficacy model: χ28=81.9, comparative fit index=0.977, Tucker-Lewis index=0.958, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.097), which indicated a good fit. The YI-DSS also showed high correlation with the previously developed Digital Literacy Scale (r=0.809; P<.001).
Conclusions
The YI-DSS, as a self-assessment tool, has the potential to bridge the generational information gap by promoting acceptance, motivation, and adaptation to digital technology. Furthermore, given the remote nature of digital therapeutics, an individual’s familiarity with required technologies and digital communication strongly influences their acceptance of digital treatments and the efficacy thereof. This scale can play a pivotal role in enhancing compliance with digital therapeutics by preemptively assessing individuals’ technological literacy and competency.}

A controlled experiment was conducted, followed by an online questionnaire with 65 students. Partial Least Square (PLS) Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is used to assess and test the model. The results show that student cognitive strategies impact student perception and engagement with technology and learning tasks, with AR positively impacting student academic self-efficacy in higher education. Interestingly, neither the learning space nor the students' perception of task value was shown to impact their intention to use AR. Instead, it was the characteristics of the technology itself which encouraged adoption. The study's findings reinforce the need to (1) teach and facilitate effective cognitive strategies among third level students and (2) identify and overcome negative cognitive strategies that harm student self-efficacy and engagement.}

abstract = {In the current information society, the need for securing human resources acquired with ICT competency is becoming a very important issue. In USA, England, Japan, India and Israel improving students’ ICT competency has become a pedagogical issue. Accordingly, education on ICT competency is changing in many countries emphasizing the basis of computer science. The Korean government revised the ICT curriculum of 2001 focused on the basic concepts and principles of computer science as educational policy in 2005. However, it is still difficult to determine a student’s ICT competency level and the outcome of ICT curriculum based on changed direction. Thereupon, this study has developed test tool for measuring the level of Korean elementary school students’ ICT competency based on computer science. In this study, ‘Content’ and ‘Information processing’ are established as the two axes of the test frame standard through literature research, consideration and discussion. The validity and reliability of questions are verified though the preliminary test and the main test tool has completed through question revisions considering the distribution of answers. About 40,000 students, roughly 1% of the total elementary school students, are selected for the main test. There were several findings made in this study. Korea’s elementary school students have a weakness in ‘algorithm and modeling’. Information processing stage has been found to vary by grade. A modified ‘Angoff method’ is used to confirm the spread of the ICT competency levels of the target students. From the results, the cutoff score employed to divide the subjects into three levels, excellent, average and below average, the ratio of excellent levels decreases and the ratio of below average increases in higher grades. To solve these problems, we need to emphasize algorithmic thinking oriented more principal of computer science in ICT curriculum. For more effective ICT elementary education, teaching and learning strategies appropriate for young children to teach computer science should be introduced.}

To address this gap, our study aims to construct the AI-Assisted L2 Learning Attitude Scale for Chinese College Students (AL2AS-CCS) and evaluate its reliability, validity, and relationship with L2 proficiency. Our research comprises two phases, each involving separate samples. In Phase One (Sample 1: n = 379), we conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factor structure of the AL2AS-CCS. The resulting two-factor structure consists of 12 items, categorized into cognitive and behavioral components. In Phase Two (Sample 2: n = 429), we performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the factor structure and assess model fit. CFA in Sample 2 confirmed the factor structure and demonstrated a good model fit. Additionally, the AL2AS-CCS exhibited high criterion validity, internal consistency, and cross-gender invariance. Our findings suggest that the AL2AS-CCS is a valid measurement tool for assessing Chinese college students' attitude toward AI-assisted L2 learning. Moreover, Chinese college students were discovered to maintain a moderately positive attitude toward AI-assisted L2 learning. Additionally, a positive correlation was identified between this attitude and their L2 proficiency.}

Study data were obtained by using the “Problem-Solving Skills Perception Scale for Secondary School Students”, “Critical Thinking Disposition Scale for Secondary School Students”, and “Middle School Self-Efficacy Scale.” It was examined whether the scores of the variables in the study were normally distributed. After it was understood that the data were normally distributed, the analyses were conducted. The relationships between the variables were analyzed with Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis and significant relationships were found between the variables. Then, a mediation model was established to analyze whether critical thinking has a mediating role in the relationship between middle school students' self-efficacy and problem-solving skills. The significance of the indirect effect in this mediation model was tested by the bootstrapping procedure. In the study, it was concluded that all variables were positively and significantly related to each other and critical thinking significantly mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and problem-solving skills in secondary school students.}

Considering the role of community outreach of a Higher Education Institution (HEI) in promoting sustainable regional development, based on the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda, the present study aims to verify, with the usage of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool, the alignment of community outreach actions of an HEI to the SDGs and identify its actions with the greatest impact.
Design/methodology/approach
The study is descriptive through a case study at a university in Brazil. Documentary analysis was carried out using data on more than 15,000 community outreach projects developed from 2009 to 2022, using natural language processing (NLP). In addition to the descriptive aspects, combining NLP with statistical techniques allowed us to discuss the alignment between community outreach projects and the SDGs from a longitudinal perspective.
Findings
The results demonstrated that the main SDGs in community outreach actions are SDG 17: Partnerships and Means of Implementation; SDG 4: Quality Education; SDG 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production and SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. These results are prominent because community outreach aims to establish a dialogical relationship between society and the university, conceiving the exchange of knowledge based on the actions developed and sharing knowledge with those involved in community extension.
Originality
The use of AI technologies to identify and monitor data on community outreach actions in HEI towards the SDGs, and to propose ways to share this information with internal and external stakeholders of the institution.}

This configurative review explores how the concept of creative learning has been understood and put into practice across 112 education studies since 2010. Specifically, the review addresses two questions: First, what are the constitutive features and actions that characterize creative learning? Second, what are the overarching themes that can be identified in the literature? The study reports on the findings of an extensive thematic analysis, which indicated four general approaches to creative learning: namely (1) creative agency over learning, (2) affective and embodied pathways, (3) relational ecologies, and (4) learning by doing and making. The review concludes with a discussion of each of these themes, deriving from them a set of practical recommendations and a revised definition of creative learning.}

This paper presents a systematic literature review on the use of the term reflection in FabLearn research. With this review, we provide an answer to the questions (1) what reflection means in FabLearn research, (2) how these reflections are stimulated and scaffolded in practice (i.e., teachers/facilitators and students/participants), and (3) what types of concerns or subject matters take place in reflective practices. The review is conducted in FabLearn US and Europe proceedings between 2014–2019, and resulted in 68 papers included in the analysis. The findings show that FabLearn research need to develop solid theoretical groundings and frameworks as guidelines to scaffold students’ reflection, and more in-depth understanding of reflection to investigate and carry out a more comprehensive conceptualization of the term.}

This fact made us think about the reason for this inequality. We attempted to answer such questions by means of a survey filled out by 138 students of STEM university degrees. Thanks to this survey, we have been able to understand the motivations and opinions of the students of STEM degrees regarding gender perspective. Our study highlights the possible influence of computer and video game use on enrollment in STEM degrees. Furthermore, it points out the differences between men and women in computer science skills before they start their studies. The answers provided by the surveyed women showed a correlation between women who play video games and those who get better grades. In addition, women who play video games feel more integrated into STEM degrees. Finally, differences were found in gender perspective between the male and female participants.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The convergence of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases in South Africa is challenging to health systems. In this analysis, we assessed the multimorbidity health needs of individuals and communities in rural KwaZulu-Natal and established a framework to quantify met and unmet health needs for individuals living with infectious and non-communicable diseases.
Methods
We analysed data collected between May 25, 2018, and March 13, 2020, from participants of a large, community-based, cross-sectional multimorbidity survey (Vukuzazi) that offered community-based HIV, hypertension, and diabetes screening to all residents aged 15 years or older in a surveillance area in the uMkhanyakude district in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data from the Vukuzazi survey were linked with data from demographic and health surveillance surveys with a unique identifier common to both studies. Questionnaires were used to assess the diagnosed health conditions, treatment history, general health, and sociodemographic characteristics of an individual. For each condition (ie, HIV, hypertension, and diabetes), individuals were defined as having no health needs (absence of condition), met health needs (condition that is well controlled), or one or more unmet health needs (including diagnosis, engagement in care, or treatment optimisation). We analysed met and unmet health needs for individual and combined conditions and investigated their geospatial distribution.
Findings
Of 18 041 participants who completed the survey (12 229 [67·8%] were female and 5812 [32·2%] were male), 9898 (54·9%) had at least one of the three chronic diseases measured. 4942 (49·9%) of these 9898 individuals had at least one unmet health need (1802 [18·2%] of 9898 needed treatment optimisation, 1282 [13·0%] needed engagement in care, and 1858 [18·8%] needed a diagnosis). Unmet health needs varied by disease; 1617 (93·1%) of 1737 people who screened positive for diabetes, 2681 (58·2%) of 4603 people who screened positive for hypertension, and 1321 (21·7%) of 6096 people who screened positive for HIV had unmet health needs. Geospatially, met health needs for HIV were widely distributed and unmet health needs for all three conditions had specific sites of concentration; all three conditions had an overlapping geographical pattern for the need for diagnosis.
Interpretation
Although people living with HIV predominantly have a well controlled condition, there is a high burden of unmet health needs for people living with hypertension and diabetes. In South Africa, adapting current, widely available HIV care services to integrate non-communicable disease care is of high priority.

This study investigates the nuanced relationship between generative AI use and university students' self-efficacy and technological dependence, illuminating the underlying paradoxes and implications for inclusive education practices. Through a survey of 348 university students, with 200 valid responses analyzed, we uncover the direct and indirect impacts of generative AI usage frequency on AI dependence. Our findings reveal a paradoxical effect: enhanced AI usage significantly amplifies students' confidence and efficiency in learning, yet simultaneously intensifies their dependence on AI. This dual impact both supports and complicates the incorporation of AI technologies into educational settings, underscoring the need for a balanced approach to leveraging AI in teaching and learning. Our study underscores the critical importance of a nuanced understanding of AI's role in education. It highlights the necessity of crafting an educational landscape where technology augments learning processes without compromising independent learning capabilities. By navigating the complex interplay between technological advancement and educational inclusivity, our findings guide the development of AI-assisted learning environments that are not only effective but also equitable and accessible.}

By using the procedural data generated in collaboration, the multidimensional item response theory and the hierarchical linear model, the present study examined the characteristics of student teachers’ collaborative problem solving competency in two real online learning tasks in a sample of 42 student teachers. The results suggested that the bigram-indicator may be more representative of student teachers’ collaborative problem solving competency than the unigram-indicator. Moreover, student teachers’ collaborative problem solving competency in the two online learning tasks was a five-factor structure. In addition, the social and cognitive dimensions of collaborative problem solving competency were unfolded orderly in collaborative tasks. Finally, the conclusions, implications, limitations, and future research directions were discussed.}

Assessing HOTS can increase students’ awareness of their cognitive abilities and promote the development of advanced cognitive skills. This study proposes an automated assessment approach for HOTS, to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on experts and are often short-term. The exceptional knowledge base and advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted academics to extend their application to various areas, where they outperform models limited to specific domains. Inspired by this, we propose a framework for the automated assessment of HOTS using LLMs, called LLM4HA. The framework consists of two distinct models: a text-based exercise classification model constructed from pre-trained BERT, and a student HOTS assessment model based on response data, constructed by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. To validate the performance of our framework, we established a classification rule based on Bloom’s taxonomy for exercise classification. We collected 43,070 exercise data points from 181 undergraduate students, from which exercise text data and response data were obtained. The results demonstrate that LLM4HA successfully classifies exercises and assesses students’ HOTS. The BERT-based classification model outperforms ChatGPT-4, and the LLMs-based fine-tuning model significantly outperforms the RNNs-based model. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify the causes of this outcome. The findings indicate that the robust knowledge base and sophisticated architecture may be crucial for achieving optimal performance in the HOTS assessment task. The implementations are available at https://github.com/xxiongGG/LLM4HA-mian-0302.}

However, due to limitations in current techniques, they are unable to deal with lecture’s complex structures, which contain multiple knowledge themes. To address this issue, we proposed an original theme-based lecture summary (TLS) system that combines graph-based theme segmentation algorithms and LLMs, consisting of data preparation, theme segmentation, summary generation, and consistency evaluation stages. To assess the effectiveness of the system, an education intervention was implemented using a mixed-methods research design. Forty-six undergraduate students took part in an authentic lecture context for eight weeks. The quantitative study used a 2 × 2 factorial design, with intervention conditions including lecture type (conceptual vs. procedural) and TLS-generated summaries (with vs. without). Then, eight of the participants were chosen for a focus-group interview to learn about student satisfaction. The study finds that: 1) TLS-generated summaries have a significant positive influence on knowledge recall; 2) lecture type has no effect on the intervention outcomes of TLS-generated summaries, regardless of whether it is conceptually or procedurally oriented; and 3) TLS-generated summaries can increase student satisfaction. The current study broadens the use of LLMs in authentic educational settings to promote student success.}

In each of the classrooms a small number of computers and an interactive whiteboard (IWB) were utilised. This paper uses a case study approach to describe how engagement with Scratch and independent use of the IWB enabled children to work collaboratively to solve design challenges. Initial results indicate that the Scratch program is engaging for children. It created an environment where the children were, by necessity, using problem-solving processes such as goal setting, and generating and testing of ideas. The interactive whiteboard afforded rich opportunities for children to collaborate and share their thinking. Some questions and implications for the learning and teaching of elementary school mathematics are explored at the conclusion of the paper.}

While teacher support is crucial for learning, little is known about how it influences students' attitudes and flow experience across different achievement groups in programming education. This study examined the interrelationships among perceived teacher support, students' attitudes, and flow experience in programming learning across different achievement levels. Data were collected through surveys from 549 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Students were categorised into three groups based on their programming achievement levels: above-average, average, and below-average. A multi-group mediation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between variables. The above-average group showed significantly more positive perceptions across all variables than other groups. Students’ attitudes mediated the relationship between perceived teacher support and flow experience differently across achievement groups. The findings highlight the importance of differentiated teacher support strategies across achievement tiers and suggest that fostering positive attitudes towards programming is crucial for all achievement levels, particularly through enhancing the perceived usefulness of programming.}

We combined thematic and interaction analyses of empirical data and identified three themes: 1) engagement and spontaneous concepts, 2) programming and making physical objects, and 3) subject integration. Our conceptual framework for the analyses integrated two features of the Vygotskian sociocultural theory of learning: concept development as a dialectical process of scientific and everyday concepts and the “tool and symbol” duality. Our findings show that both top-down and bottom-up approaches to integrating school subjects into a makerspace were effective but underused. We illustrate this by mapping pupils' shared understanding in a sociotechnical space, visualized as a process of “rising to the concrete”, which may require teacher's scaffolding at different levels of abstraction and use of instructional materials in different modalities.}

Specifically, the two studies examined (a) change in PI and career aspirations during a single semester, (b) the relationship between change in career aspirations and change in PI, and (c) the influence of career aspirations, PI, and change in career aspirations and PI on achievement in computer science courses. Findings from both studies revealed that students experienced a decrease in endogenous PI and career aspirations and an increase in exogenous PI during the semester. Study 1 showed that non-computer science majors experienced greater shifts in PI and career aspirations than computer science majors. Study 2 showed that the change in PI happened in parallel and was curvilinear, with more change happening in the first half of the semester than the second half. Both studies also showed that computer-science-related career aspirations were associated with PI, and that aspirations and PI had a stronger relationship with scores on a computer science knowledge test than with course grades. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.}

abstract = {The paper considers methods to organize a network of links to parameterized data objects. A data object is an object identified by standard methods, including the network identifiers URI, URL and URN. The data objects can be either atomic or have a complex structure, including links to other objects, and this ensures the linking of objects into a network, which can be considered as an information graph. It turns out to be possible to formulate a number of criteria for supporting the integrity of such a structure; the paper proposes language tools to formulate such criteria. An essential feature of this network is the dependence of the objects’ information content on a number of parameters, first of all, on time. Depending on the parameter, the information content of the object can change both with the preservation of the integrity of the structure, and with its damage. The paper considers methods for a parameterized description of objects while maintaining integrity based on the formalism of category theory. The formalization used allows defining two relations between objects and their names (identifiers): access and links. The paper studies the basic properties of such relations and reveals the differences between them. Category theoretical means of describing objects require appropriate support tools for practical application. The paper proposes a configuration of support tools for a network of links to parameterized data objects based on a combination of conceptual modeling tools and applicative computing tools. The proposed tools provide basic methods of access to the network of information graphs. An essential feature of the proposed tools is the ability to determine the subjective way of considering the information graph (based on the category of correlations), as well as harmonizing an objective and subjective way of considering. The proposed tools were tested in the development of applied information systems in the field of implementation of the best available technologies (BAT).}

This allows accurate data analysis and completion of scientific research on data obtained at geologically different places. This study used 4 lithologies datasets with high dimensionality and multiclass imbalance problems for analysis and classification. The imbalance of data classification is one of the most important problems facing current data analysis. Data imbalance can considerably influence classification performance, especially when dealing with other difficulty variables such as the presence of overlapping class distributions. This impact is especially obvious in multi-class conditions when mutual imbalance relations across classes complicate matters even further. Moreover, the problem of high dimensionality can lead to increased computing complexity and overfitting, and thus these issues can affect classification performance. To overcome these problems, we developed a new hybrid deep learning multi-class imbalanced learning method that combines Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to resample the data, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most useful predictive features. Finally, we believe that our developments can help improve geology research by providing accurate classification and rapid answers about interpreting data obtained in various study areas.}

abstract = {Introduction: The construction industry, characterized by its hazardous working conditions, particularly in extreme environments such as high temperatures, presents significant challenges for construction workers in mitigating heat-related illnesses (HRIs). Method: This study advances the application of evidence-centered design (ECD) in developing an effective heat stress training program for construction and general workers. The methodology encompasses comprehensive steps, including: (1) defining training objectives, (2) determining relevant knowledge domains, (3) designing assessments, (4) providing evidence of training effectiveness, and (5) developing practical tasks using real-world case studies. The training’s effectiveness was evaluated through an experimental training session in which 311 construction and general workers participated. The efficiency of the training was measured by calculating short-term, middle-term, and long-term knowledge gains about heat-related illnesses. Results: Statistical analysis revealed significant improvements in workers’ understanding of heat stress concepts, risk factor identification, prevention strategies, symptom and sign recognition, and first aid application from the short-term to the middle-term and into the long-term. Trainees’ feedback also affirmed the training’s effectiveness in enhancing awareness and preparing them to implement preventive measures against heat stress. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that a heat stress training program utilizing ECD significantly enhances the efficiency of heat stress awareness. These assessments effectively evaluate construction workers’ ability to recognize and respond to heat-related hazards. Practical applications: This finding contributes to the theoretical knowledge of construction worker safety and provides a practical framework for guiding the design of training assessments. The study addresses a gap in literature regarding the assessment of training effectiveness, offering insights for iterative improvement of safety training in construction industry.}

In K-12 education, educators have started to employ different pedagogical strategies to foster students' AI literacy. Using digital story writing (DSW) in the classroom is an effective inquiry-based pedagogical approach to address literacy development by improving language and technological abilities across disciplines. This study recruited 82 primary students in Hong Kong to attend a three-month DSW journey to learn AI and completed a knowledge test at the end of the program. Among the students, 16 best-achieving students were further invited to participate in artefact-based interviews, and we further analysed their work to understand how they formulate AI understandings. It is found that the participating students were able to propose an authentic scenario, apply their new knowledge of AI and think up meaningful AI-driven solutions in their digital stories. Furthermore, we examined students' DSW process in terms of inquiry-based pedagogical cycle (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion) to demonstrate how they learn AI. Overall, DSW as an inquiry could effectively foster students' AI literacy in using and applying AI knowledge to solve real-life problems, far beyond merely knowing and understanding related concepts. We suggest that using DSW as a pedagogy has the potential to support students to scaffold students’ AI understanding, particularly for young children.}

It is suggested that a much broader education is required in cyber-physical system (CPS) than has traditionally been the case for degree and masters' level students. CPS developers will need to be knowledgeable about natural, applied and social sciences. The curriculum for a TCPS engineer emerges as a vast range of knowledge requirements and it is suggested that ideally students will graduate with a T-shaped curriculum vitae that provides for a broad knowledge of many subjects and a deep knowledge in one or two. Studies into the appropriate curriculum for CPS have been conducted since the early 2000s, but it is noted that many of these failed to give adequate weight to ethics and topics in the social sciences. A framework for TCPS graduate and postgraduate education is provided: delivery of the curriculum must ensure students are taught in a transdisciplinary manner and develop an holistic approach to TCPS development and operation.}

We developed an augmented reality (AR)-based learning system to make programming concepts tangible. Specifically, we adopted a high interactive AR mode that allows students to freely assemble puzzle cards to compare various 3D animated programming results. This study adopted a quasi-experimental design and recruited 98 fifth graders as participants. Three groups, named the high interactive AR, low interactive AR, and the traditional learning (control) groups, were formed. The results revealed that the AR-based instruction, especially the high interactive AR mode, helped the students improve their programming achievements, gain higher learning motivation, reduce their cognitive load, and acquire a high degree of technology acceptance. The interview data mainly showed that the students in the high interactive group attained more positive experiences of assembling puzzle cards to learn programming. Our study suggests that using AR technology alone did not facilitate learning motivation, although it did produce better programming achievements compared to the traditional learning. A high interactive design such as “puzzle cards” is vital for arousing higher motivation, which can in turn facilitate a more in-depth understanding of programming logic.}

The purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of DT training on the DT and RT tendencies of pre-service teachers and to elicit the opinions of pre-service teachers on this process. The study group consisted of a total of 44 s-year pre-service teachers, 32 female and 12 male, attending the Department of Primary Teaching in a state university. The study employed an embedded design, one of the mixed methods, and qualitative research was embedded within quantitative research. An quasi-experimental method was used in the quantitative dimension of the study, and the case study design was used in the qualitative dimension. In the experimental dimension the study, data were collected by using the “Design Thinking Scale”, “Reflective Thinking Level Determination Scale” and a “Personal Information Form” developed by the researcher. The qualitative data of the study were collected by using a semi-structured interview form prepared by the researcher.

After a systematic search in online database via keyword search and snowballing approach, 22 SSCI journal papers are included in this review. Nine major factors are examined for each paper: sample groups, duration, robot types, robotics content knowledge, study type, intervention approaches, measurement instruments, major findings and instructional suggestions. The results indicate that: (1) most empirical studies were endured less than two months with a small sample size, the largest sample group was elementary school students, and most studies used LEGO robots; (2) more than half of the studies conducted a non-experimental research design, and observation, questionnaire, interview and evaluation of artifacts are commonly-used measurement instruments; and (3) instructional suggestions proposed in the 22 papers can be clustered into four themes: open environment, targeted design, appropriate pedagogy and timely support. Overall, the 22 papers suggest that RE shows great educational potential in K-12, however, there are indeed situations in which RE did not bring significant improvement in student learning. In view of this, we prospect the future research directions of RE and propose that more intervention studies with rigorous research design could be conducted in K-12.}

Based on a particular IBL framework that synthesizes the core attributes of IBL by combining the strengths of various models, the study explores educators' potential utilization of GenAI tools across the framework's phases. Among other capabilities, GenAI tools were examined for their support in content creation, assessment and feedback processes, as well as in the design of learning activities and lesson plans. This examination informed the classification of GenAI tools in this study, organizing them according to their potential utility for educators. These groups and subgroups of tools were then aligned with each phase of the IBL framework, demonstrating their role in achieving the objectives of each phase. Several practical examples across different grade levels and disciplines were also provided to highlight their prospective use. The systematic classification of GenAI tools introduced in this study fills a notable gap in the literature, thus making a valuable contribution to the field of GenAI in education. Additionally, by demonstrating how this classification can be applied as educators craft and deliver IBL lesson plans, the study further contributes by providing guidance on the effective use of these tools in real-world educational contexts.}

abstract = {Purpose
In a socio-educational context impregnated by social networks, feminist organizations and individuals have turned to social media to spread their knowledge. This paper aims to approach how feminist tweets are produced to ignite meaningful informal learning (IL) processes.
Design/methodology/approach
This study uses an interdisciplinary mixed methodology. By using Twitter tracking tools, a database has been enabled to catalogue feminist hashtags into topics and categories for further analysis. These data have been contrasted with surveys to the managers of the most followed feminist accounts in Spain and Catalonia.
Findings
From an educational perspective, the analysed feminist hashtags have been organized in 13 different topic categories. The different propagation processes on Twitter – tweeting and retweeting – imply diverse learning processes. Moreover, tweets with complementary information such as images or links generate the most interaction, being the preferred format for IL.
Research limitations/implications
Researching with Big Data in educational sciences is a field in development, and Twitter data collection tools are mostly addressed to marketing and economic sectors; thus, free tools with limited services were used, offering the analysis of a brief and concrete situation of a platform in constant change. Although this ephemeral data and its relevance does not prevail over time, it has an impact on citizens’ learning.
Originality/value
It is the first study in Spain that illustrates the informal education that feminism offers to the community, facing the complexity of measuring Twitter with an educational perspective through the use of marketing tools.}

Data collection was performed within an ethnographic approach with participant observation, questionnaires and social network interaction, and analysis was based on the constructs of Activity Theory. Four groups of students were identified with similar needs and motivations, each engaged at different levels according to the nature of the tasks, interaction with peers and educators, and personal expectations. Results reveal that, even in a supposedly fun and innovative context, the relationship between the object of the activity and the students' needs is crucial to promote engagement and learning. Identifying and taking into account students' needs and expectations is reinforced as an indispensable step in educational interventions.}

Due to the opaqueness of these assistants, however, children in particular might be unaware of potential negative consequences (e.g., with regard to privacy). To gain a deeper understanding of children’s knowledge about VAs, of how to facilitate knowledge regarding VA technology (focusing here on parental interventions), and of how children’s knowledge and understanding affects their communicative behavior towards VAs (focusing here on telling a secret to the VA), we conducted a longitudinal field study with 16 families (N=20 children). The emphasis was on differentiating between how VAs store and process data, as both aspects are important for a sophisticated usage but vary in how they are experienced or understood. The qualitative data demonstrated that children draw observable inferences from VAs’ behavior, which explains why children know more about how data is processed than about how it is stored or accessed. Our results indicate that parental interventions positively affect children’s understanding of data processing, but that this cannot be transferred to data storage, indicating the need for self-explaining systems. Lastly, knowledge about how data is stored negatively predicts the willingness to entrust a secret to the system, which underlines the importance of a basic understanding of how technologies work, also for younger users.}

Studies show that higher education adult-learners are wary of the digital environment in computer-mediated courses, and hence refrain from online interaction resulting in lower learning outcomes and lower perceived learning satisfaction. Without an instructional model that supports adult-learners’ online interaction, teachers may fall back on traditional in-class teaching in an effort to make up for missed learning opportunities. To remedy this, design principles, specifically supportive for adult-learners, were co-designed into an instructional model reflecting the concentric dynamics that strengthen said programmes. In order to validate and improve the quality of the model a Delphi study was carried out among experts (n = 8) to evaluate the various components of the model, including its overall supportiveness for adult-learners in computer-mediated learning. The experts were selected based on their expertise and research in blended learning. Two evaluative rounds through surveys in the programme Crowdtech took place until full alignment of the experts’ opinions was had. The resulting model is a concentric one, illustrating how activities are best distributed across the online environment and the in-class environment, and how social presence can be evoked. This study provides insights into the design of computer-mediated learning programmes tailored for higher education adult-learners as it closes the gap in literature on instructional models and blended learning design. This validated instructional model may help course designers in designing or improving computer-mediated learning programmes.}

The Design-Bid-Build (DBB) project delivery method further exacerbates these issues by hindering effective stakeholder collaboration. By contrast, integrated project delivery and building information modeling (BIM) have shown potential for enhanced coordination and waste reduction. Yet, the continued reliance on manual rebar modeling in BIM highlights a pressing need for intelligent automation. This study presents a novel BIM-based algorithm that leverages Dynamo for rebar layout optimization and Navisworks for automatic clash detection, integrating rebar optimization prior to BIM model creation to minimize data exchange errors. The methodology was validated on a continuous-column rebar arrangement, supported by a standardized rebar summary sheet to streamline the optimization and clash-detection process. Key findings indicate that this approach significantly reduces working hours while achieving high modeling accuracy compared to traditional manual methods. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to transform rebar layout practices, enabling smart, efficient, and sustainable construction through automated clash-free rebar layout generation.}

abstract = {Honey bee foraging is a complex behavior because it involves tens of thousands of organisms making decisions about where to collect pollen and nectar based on the quality of resources and the distance to flowers. Studying this aspect of their biology is possible through direct observations but the large number of individuals involved in this behavior makes the implementation of technologies ideal to scale up this type of study. Consequently, there is a need for instruments that can facilitate accurate assessments of honey bee foraging at the colony level. To address this need, this work aimed to develop an automated imaging system for monitoring the in-and-out activity of honey bee foragers as they walk through a customized entrance with a camera sensor at the hive entrance. We used AprilTags attached to each bee’s thorax to provide unique identification numbers that allowed the system to track in-and-out events throughout the foraging season of the colony. Our design relies on low-cost Raspberry Pi computers and cameras, along with commercially off-the-shelf components, making it easily reproducible with the open-source documentation provided. We successfully deployed and evaluated our system in six locations, demonstrating consistent results. In this paper, we present the details about the development of the system, data collected from multiple colonies, and post-processing analysis from one of our apiaries. Our results highlight the system’s effectiveness in monitoring honey bee trips, capturing various behaviors associate with their activities outside the colony, which lay the groundwork for future estimations of foraging distances.}

One way to address this challenge is to provide practice problems for students in these topics that are considered difficult to comprehend — such as nested loops. It is proven that practice aids program comprehension, hence, since it is time consuming to manually create many practice problems; synthesising these problems is an Expert Artificial Intelligence Task that is worth investigating. In this paper we present the synthesis of nested loop exercises in Python for practice using a context-free grammar. We defined the grammar rules for modeling program templates. Algorithms were designed and implemented for the generation of structurally different nested loop exercises based on the defined production rules of the context-free grammar. Each program generated consists of two or more looping statements, with a nesting, and the context-free grammar rules also allow for the spawning of infinitely many sub-loops for every loop. We checked for the correctness of the synthesised nested loop programs with an experimental procedure of iteratively supplying these programs to the Python interpreter. The first 120,000 iterations returned no syntactic bugs, hence, showing that these programs do compile and have outputs. Furthermore, an evaluation of the programs was carried out in a survey with 210 participants (novice and expert programmers). The results of the evaluation show that over 82% of the participants agreed that the synthesised exercises were correctly generated, solvable and can be used as practice exercises for novice programmers in introductory programming modules. 120,000 iterations of synthesised loop programs can be found at: https://tinyurl.com/nestedloops2021.}

The EUAIPS scale encompasses impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness in using AI for problem-solving. We collected data from a diverse sample of Hong Kong senior secondary and university students before (N = 477) and after the course (N = 409). Results demonstrated that the EUAIPS scale with a three-factor structure had good reliability and validity. Students also felt significantly more empowered to use AI for problem-solving after a 14-h course using AI for problem-solving. These findings empirically support the affective dimension of AI literacy and show that psychological control/competence is particularly important for students to harness AI to solve problems at the affective level.

To understand how such agent-based complex systems function and respond to change and disturbances, agent-based modeling (ABM) is increasingly recognized as the main way forward. Many motivating examples of agent-based models exist that are realistic enough to successfully support the management of complex systems, but these solutions are case-specific and contribute few general insights into the functioning of systems. General theory, though, is highly needed because we cannot model each system and question. Still, across disciplines, a critical mass of expertise has accumulated that could transform ABM into a more coherent and efficient approach to discover the functioning of complex social-economic-ecological systems. To this end, we need a cross-disciplinary discussion among researchers and a goal-oriented synthesis to identify the general principles and theories essential to improve our understanding and management of complex systems.}

abstract = {This study aims to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the quality of college physical dance education using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and deep learning methods. The study introduces a teaching quality evaluation (TQE) model based on one-dimensional CNN, addressing issues such as subjectivity and inconsistent evaluation criteria in traditional assessment methods. By constructing a comprehensive TQE system comprising 24 evaluation indicators, this study innovatively applies deep learning technology to quantitatively assess the quality of physical dance education. This TQE model processes one-dimensional evaluation data by extracting local features through convolutional layers, reducing dimensions via pooling layers, and feeding feature vectors into a classifier through fully connected layers to achieve an overall assessment of teaching quality. Experimental results demonstrate that after 150 iterations of training and validation on the TQE model, convergence is achieved, with mean squared error (MSE) decreasing to 0.0015 and 0.0216 on the training and validation sets, respectively. Comparatively, the TQE model exhibits significantly lower MSE on the training, validation, and test sets compared to the Back-Propagation Neural Network, accompanied by a higher R2 value, indicating superior accuracy and performance in data fitting. Further analysis on robustness, parameter sensitivity, multi-scenario adaptability, and long-term learning capabilities reveals the TQE model's strong resilience and stability in managing noisy data, varying parameter configurations, diverse teaching contexts, and extended time-series data. In practical applications, the TQE model is implemented in physical dance courses at X College to evaluate teaching quality and guide improvement strategies for instructors, resulting in notable enhancements in teaching quality and student satisfaction. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive evaluation of university physical dance education quality through a multidimensional assessment system and the application of the 1D-CNN model.

The field of artificial intelligence and its applications in the education sector give rise to a multidisciplinary field that brings together computer science, statistics, psychology and, of course, education. Within this context, this review aimed to synthesise existing research focused on provide improvements on primary/secondary student assessment using some AI tool. Thus, nine original research studies (641 participants), published between 2010 and 2023, met the inclusion criteria defined in this systematic literature review. The main contributions of the application of AI in the assessment of students at these lower educational levels focus on predicting their performance, automating and making evaluations more objective by means of neural networks or natural language processing, the use of educational robots to analyse their learning process, and the detection of specific factors that make classes more attractive. This review shows the possibilities and already existing uses that AI can bring to education, specifically in the evaluation of student performance at the primary and secondary levels.

It interrogates one policy instrument, namely CONPES 3988, which establishes the importance of digital technologies in national-level educational policies and subsequent strategies. CONPES 3988 draws a strong focus on educational ‘innovation’, which is explicitly conceptualised through digital technology, understood as the transformation of traditional educational practices through educational technologies to improve educational quality. CONPES 3988 establishes the actions needed to realise a process of educational innovation through educational technologies and has four pillars: to increase access to digital technologies for the creation of innovative learning spaces, to improve Internet connectivity of official educational institutions, to promote the appropriation of digital technologies in the educational community, and to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of the use, access and impact of digital technologies in education. CONPES 3988 draws a strong focus on educational ‘innovation’, which is explicitly conceptualised through digital technology, understood as the transformation of traditional educational practices through educational technologies to improve educational quality. CONPES 3988 captures and surfaces digital imaginaries that speak to rural education, particularly in how it is framed and performed and how digital technology use is explicitly tied to market discourses of quality, sustainability, transformation, and breaks from tradition. Rural education in Colombia, and indeed rurality itself and its attendant plurality, are potentially disadvantaged in this framing as they become transactional actors in a larger educational system framed increasingly in digital technologies emerging from the urban centres of the Colombian government. Such an analysis provides insights that extend well beyond Colombia, particularly in noting how rurality and rural education are reframed when there is policy and governance emphasis on digital technology use in education.}

Following a review of the literature on epistemic practices including examples of argumentation, modeling and explanations, we focus on teachers' learning of argumentation. An important element of teachers' understanding of argumentation in science as an epistemic practice involves how they might potentially distinguish it from argumentation in other subject domains. In other words, given a broad set of subjects can be considered from an argumentation perspective (e.g., religious education, history, English), what differentiates argumentation as an epistemic practice of science? We will address this question by contrasting how argumentation is framed broadly in epistemic practices of two contrasting school subjects: science and religious education. Following this theoretical account, we will then draw on some empirical data from the Oxford Argumentation in Religion and Science project based in England to illustrate how in-service science teachers view argumentation and engage in its teaching. Implications for curriculum reform as well as teacher education are discussed.}

The ability to generate code snippets using AI chatbots has introduced new opportunities and challenges in teaching programming. However, there is limited agreement on how students integrate them into their learning processes. This study aims to explore how students utilize AI chatbots in the "Object-Oriented Programming" course and examine the relationship between chatbot usage and academic performance. To address this, 231 students completed a survey assessing the frequency and manner of chatbot usage. Descriptive statistical methods were employed to analyze usage and perceptions, while Spearman’s correlation was used to investigate the connection between chatbot usage and course performance. Results indicated that students primarily relied on AI chatbots for programming tasks. Interestingly, students’ performance negatively correlates with the reported frequency of using these tools. These findings provide valuable insights for programming educators, offering a better understanding of students' perceptions and use of AI chatbots. This knowledge can inform strategies for integrating these tools effectively into computer science education.}

At the same time, augmented reality (AR) technology, which combines physical objects with digital visualizations, is becoming increasingly applicable for makerspace activities and has potential to address challenges for student learning in makerspaces. However, there is a lack of understanding of how to use and integrate AR in real makerspace environments. In this research we use a co-design methodology to address the following questions: (1) How can AR be useful for education in makerspaces? (2) How are students impacted by the process of co-designing AR technology? and (3) What are practical considerations for integrating AR in makerspaces? We engaged in a co-design process in a semester-long makerspace course attended by 18 students in a graduate school of education. Through this process, we generated six prototypes with seven student co-designers, exploring AR use in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. We also identified areas where AR technology can benefit makerspaces, such as teaching STEM skills, facilitating construction activities, enhancing contextualization of learning, and debugging. We observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and AR, and increased critical thinking about AR technology. These results suggest considerations and guidelines for integrating AR technology into makerspace environments.}

abstract = {Background
Critical thinking (CT) is an important 21st-century skill which enables individuals to actively use their knowledge and problem-solving skills to overcome life challenges. Educators, employers, and policymakers focus on CT skills to foster scientific thinking in education. In many countries, the development of CT skills has become a major component in education. CT skills training is offered to students based on the assumption that every student learns these skills in the same manner (i.e., homogeneity assumption). However, if heterogenous groups exist, accounting for this may provide more effective CT skills training.
Methods
Latent profile analysis (LPA) was applied to the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) with middle school students from South Korea (N = 520), Turkey (N = 996), and the United States (N = 1,599), separately, to determine if CT subpopulations exist for each country. Generalizability of the latent profiles across countries were investigated through a multi-group LPA similarity assessment.
Results
Employing multiple fit criteria, a three-profile solution was identified for each country, and multi-group LPA analysis supported the similarity of the profiles across countries.
Conclusion
Similar CT skill profiles across countries suggest that interventions for developing CT skills may be appropriate across educational contexts. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind a student's CT profile and inform interventions or curricula for fostering CT skills. Future directions and limitations were discussed.}

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has exerted a greater influence on EFL learners' digital multimodal composing (DMC) process. GAI focuses on creating new textual and multimodal content using large language models (LLMs), and it puts different demands on EFL learners. Although much research has been conducted on EFL learners' AI literacy in various socio-cultural contexts, more attention should now be paid to EFL learners' GAI literacy in the DMC context, a new autonomous model of literacy. It should be noted that even though some studies may concentrate on users' perceptions and experiences with GAI, which may be closely tied to GAI literacy, there lacks the development of a scale for assessing GAI literacy in DMC. Thus, this study attempted to fill these research gaps by developing and validating an applicable and generalizable instrument to measure Chinese EFL learners' multimodal GAI literacy in their DMC process. Two subsamples (n1 = 296, n2 = 294) were randomly invited to respond to the GAIDMCS, and the data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the validity and reliability of the instrument. The findings suggested that a four-factor solution with 17 items can help explain Chinese EFL learners’ GAI literacy in DMC in terms of affective learning, behavior learning, cognitive learning, and ethical learning. Our GAI literacy in DMC scale may help improve GAI education for researchers and practitioners by providing a comprehensive and plausible framework that can serve as an outline for further syllabus design.}

However, further research is needed to understand how AWE is perceived by middle school students in the United States, as they have received less attention in this field. This study investigated U.S. middle school students’ perceptions of the MI Write AWE system. Students reported their perceptions of MI Write's usefulness using Likert-scale items and an open-ended survey question. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent topics in students’ comments, followed by qualitative analysis to interpret the themes related to those topics. We then examined whether these themes differed among students who agreed or disagreed that MI Write was a useful learning tool. The LDA analysis revealed four latent topics: (1) students desire more in-depth feedback, (2) students desire an enhanced user experience, (3) students value MI Write as a learning tool but desire greater personalization, and (4) students desire increased fairness in automated scoring. The distribution of these topics varied based on students’ ratings of MI Write's usefulness, with Topic 1 more prevalent among students who generally did not find MI Write useful and Topic 3 more prominent among those who found MI Write useful. Our findings contribute to the enhancement and implementation of AWE systems, guide future AWE technology development, and highlight the efficacy of LDA in uncovering latent topics and patterns within textual data to explore students’ perspectives of AWE.}

This study explores how lesson study (LS) can promote elementary Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers’ professional development (TPD) in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes and beliefs in the maker education (ME) context.
Design/methodology/approach
This is a case study of a LS conducted in China involving four primary school teachers, 20 grade-4 students, and one researcher who also acted as a facilitator. This study adopted an integrated model that combined the unique characteristics of Chinese LS (CLS) with the Dutch LS (LSNL) model.
Findings
This study revealed that LS participation facilitates teachers’ integration of new ME pedagogical practices in their classrooms, while their attitudes and beliefs regarding teaching and learning are increasingly aligned with ME principles. However, challenges such as time constraints, lack of research skills, and insufficient learning resources have also been identified.
Research limitations/implications
This was a small-scale study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
Practical implications
This study expands the use of LS in the ME context by highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing teachers’ PD in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes, and beliefs. It also recommends incorporating diverse international LS models to address the limitations associated with localized models of TPD.
Originality/value
The originality of this study lies in its adoption of an integrated LS model to enhance STEM teachers’ PD in an ME context. The findings of this study further strengthen evidence supporting the positive impact of LS on teachers’ PD.}

abstract = {This paper describes a four-year observation using a model designed and tested in a middle school maker space, called problem-based science (PbS). PbS was used as the primary model for a middle school science curriculum adapted by the tools and mindsets of the maker movement. PbS is learning through inventing and problem solving — while using the latest in fabrication technology, like 3D printers and laser cutters, as well as more traditional making skills, like electronics, robotics, sewing and carpentry. PbS is based on Seymour Papert’s constructionism, set to a science curriculum taught full time in a makerspace or fablab. Bridging ideas in design thinking, maker education, and applied math and science, the term problem-based science was used to describe how learning would look, sound, and feel different in a makerspace, when a focus was on learner-centered curriculum. The design and testing of this curriculum took place as part of the 5th and 6th grade science courses offered at a private (non-public) school in California (USA) the fall of 2012, through the spring of 2016. Through daily formative assessment, as well as exit surveys, the patterns and benefits of learning in a self-directed learning space, designed for constructionism, were observed. This paper shares the highlights of those years. Video taped exit surveys conducted by the author, show that self-direction is both challenging and rewarding, students often felt trusted and respected, even if they did not always feel supported in a manner common in a more teacher directed classroom setting. Daily informal classroom observations revealed that using student driven, open-ended problem solving, rather than a 100% teacher led, step by step lab, lends to a more diverse pool of leadership practice in students and higher engagement in hard problems. Students typically seen as struggling in traditional classrooms, identified as experts and successful learners in this setting. Lastly, using PbS as a model for science literacy allows the youngest of learners to practice mindsets and habits typical of real scientists and inventors, fostering early identify formation in STEM fields.}

Building on the learning theory of Constructionism, this intervention study used a curriculum intervention program, “Making a Makerspace” (MM), to integrate the makerspace into Chinese kindergartens. We used a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the effects of this curriculum intervention, with 120 children enrolled in the experimental classrooms, while the other 111 children enrolled in the waitlist control classrooms. Teacher-report child performance (N = 231) showed that the MM program resulted in significantly higher scores in children's STEM habits of mind in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Analyses of parent-report child behaviors revealed that there was a significant effect of the MM program on post-intervention temperamental surgency. Our evidence shows that such a scalable program encourages and guides teachers to build a positive learning environment for supporting young children's making and thinking in everyday preschool experiences. The makerspace further sets a solid foundation for the development of children's STEM thinking skills and socioemotional skills in a rapidly changing digital society.}

This paper focuses at the problem mentioned as the individual migration in a problem domain. There is a lack of computational models which operate in an environment of variable domains and the contribution is to develop such a model. The advance is in establishing the mechanism for driving the dynamics of the sets and individuals. As a consequence, the behavior of the variables in query logical expression becomes predictable suppressing the possible semantic instability.}

abstract = {Health systems worldwide are confronted with enormous amounts of heterogenous data from various clinical sources. Additionally, the trend toward precision medicine, in order to tailor decisions and therapies to the individual patient, generates enormous amounts of *omics data. Modern medicine is turning into a data science. The problem is that most of these data are in arbitrarily high dimensions, making manual analysis difficult, yet impossible for humans. This requires automated methods of data science, which is what machine learning provides. Automatic machine learning methods show impressive results in dealing with big data, because such algorithms can learn from training samples to gain knowledge from experience, thus helping to make decisions and predictions. The more data, the better these algorithms perform. Unfortunately, in medicine, we are often confronted with a small number of data sets, “little data,” rare events, and complex data, where automatic approaches suffer from insufficient training sets. This calls for interactive machine learning with a doctor in the loop, who can be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristic selection of data samples. Therefore, what would otherwise be an NP-hard problem reduces greatly in complexity through the input and the assistance of a medical professional involved in the machine learning pipeline.}

abstract = {The aim of this work is threefold. Firstly, an empirical study was designed with the aim of investigating the beliefs that High School Computing (HSC) teachers hold about: (a) their motivational orientation, self-efficacy, and self-expectations as Computing teachers, (b) the nature of HSC and its curricula, (c) how their students could be better learners in Computing, and the expectations they have of their students, and (d) their own teaching approaches and the alternatives they propose for best teaching of HSC. Secondly, an empirical study was realized to investigate the same HSC teachers' classroom practices. Thirdly, possible associations between the teachers' beliefs and their teaching practices were investigated. 25 HSC teachers participated, their beliefs being elicited through structured interviews, while their practices were investigated through non-participant observation, using structured observation sheets. The analysis of the data revealed that HSC teachers as a group held various beliefs about the aforementioned issues: some of these beliefs can ‘empower’ teachers to realize constructivist approaches while others can ‘constrain’ them to the well-known traditional behaviorist practices. The majority of HSC teachers expressed mixed beliefs (‘empowering’ and ‘constraining’) and reported feeling overwhelmed, with little control over their teaching, due to contextual barriers, the rapid evolution of Computing and, subsequently, their lack of knowledge about current trends and didactics in this discipline, as well as the perceived students' culture about Computing as playing games and surfing the Internet. Data analysis also shows that there are synergies between HSC teachers' beliefs and practices. In the case of mixed beliefs, at least one ‘constraining’ belief is reflected in teachers' real practices. However, the descriptions of practices given by most of those teachers during the interviews are not fully reflected in their practices.}

The main challenging obstacles of such globalization are: embedding semantics into the competence credentials carriers, trusted dissemination of verifiable competence tokens, the heterogeneous ontologies mapping, and sustainable service delivery infrastructure. The mainstream motivation of our research is the specification and development of a conceptual framework that fosters the interoperability of different stakeholders, whether individual or institutional, to declare, share and maintain the representative collections of information resources related to the particular Education, Learning, Teaching, Training, and Performing (Research, Development, Production, and Service) endeavors. In this article, we have specified an open, heterogeneous, interoperable conceptual framework capable of orchestrating past, current, and future paradigms to foster building the foundations for comparative analysis and evaluation of traditional and nontraditional competency-building processes, joined with students' portfolio creation, dissemination, and management. It is a starting specification that would serve for the future: open, heterogeneous, cooperative/collaborative, service-oriented software framework specification and development.}

abstract = {For decades, computing speeds seemingly doubled every 24 months by increasing the processor clock speed, thus giving software a “free ride” to better performance. This free ride, however, effectively ended by the mid-2000s. With clock speeds having plateaued and computational horsepower instead increasing due to increasing the number of cores per processor, the vision for parallel computing, which started more than 40 years ago, is a revolution that has now (ubiquitously) arrived. In addition to traditional supercomputing clusters, parallel computing with multiple cores can be found in desktops, laptops, and even mobile smartphones. This ubiquitous parallelism in hardware presents a major challenge: the difficulty in easily extracting parallel performance via current software abstractions. Consequently, this paper presents an approach that reduces the learning curve to parallel programming by introducing such concepts into a visual (but currently sequential) programming language called Snap!, which was inspired by MIT’s Scratch project. Furthermore, our proposed visual abstractions can automatically generate parallel code for the end user to run in parallel on a variety of platforms from personal computing devices to supercomputers. Ultimately, this work seeks to increase parallel programming literacy so that users, whether novice or experienced, may leverage a world of ubiquitous parallelism to enhance productivity in all walks of life, including the sciences, engineering, commerce, and liberal arts.}

abstract = {As cities are developing to smart, new systems are utilized that contain a multitude of critical infrastructures. Although these offer major advantages, they are also exposed to new external and frequently uncontrollable factors increasing their risk exposure and enhancing their vulnerability. Therefore, increasing resilience during city development has become a prerequisite for its survival, but continuous resilience improvement led by workforce will help them to prosper. According to researchers, officers should be able to catalogue and prioritize threats and vulnerabilities, but is this only the case? Discrete studies detail and analyze in-depth risks related to smart cities, however, how these risks are addressed by workforce and how these are related to their competencies have not been thoroughly understood to date. If vulnerabilities are not understood and analyzed appropriately by the city workforce and stakeholders, unanticipated consequences and cascading failures may potential occur, even when crises are expected. The objective of this article is to inquire into responsibilities regarding crisis issues concerning the necessary competencies for resilience officers, by exploring current perceptions, expectations and recommendations as these are acknowledged in experts’ opinions and experiences. To do so, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to experts in the field, across various cities in Greece, to indicate responsibilities, and prioritize competencies that resilient officers in smart cities should possess. The findings highlighted significant responsibilities related to managing smart city risks and identified a distinct set of competencies unique to officers in this area, emphasizing the need for targeted efforts to enhance urban resilience through the initiatives led by city officers. This article establishes a clear path for advancing smart city research by highlighting competencies that could be integrated into educational curriculums. These competencies are essential for training a workforce that not only enhances disaster management awareness but also equips cities to handle potential catastrophic events effectively, thereby laying the groundwork for more resilient urban environments.}

abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability that exhibits sluggish progress in vocal development, restricted interest in normal activity and repetitive disoriented behavior. This syndrome, has gained a lot of attention due to its prevalence among children across all countries and from different economic backgrounds. However, ASD detection and treatment yet remains in its infancy due to the lack of awareness among parents, limited screening of proper developmental milestones and a dearth of diagnostic tools to classify this syndrome with convincing accuracy. Recent studies report that scalable biomarkers for early detection have made little progress in research due to the erraticism of this disorder. Moreover, the study on developing tools or applications for parents, teachers, and healthcare workers to identify children who exhibit any form of autism is still a work in progress. The research work undertaken in this paper presents an analysis of supervised machine learning algorithms on mining interesting details that link the diverse nature of ASD and the possibility of computationally detecting markers for the syndrome. The preliminary findings on the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms in ASD classification is reported with the possibility of integrating deep learning architectures for ASD detection and therapy.}

Creating an automation literacy from the Primary School's age is beneficial for pupils because it supports the development of valuable skills that allow the comprehension and analysis of real-world phenomena. Even if many researchers and policymakers have advocated for engineering education since early education, it is usually kept for undergraduate and graduate-level education. What prevents systems theory and control education from being integrated into K12 education is the lack of available educational resources and the lack of indicators to represent the learning gain of students. To help teachers in the latter aspect, a solution can be studying the entire process as a cyber-physical human system (CPHS). The paper consists of a brief report about the work carried out by authors to represent the entire classroom as a CPHS where the physical robots designed by students, humans (teachers and learners), and cybertechnologies are interconnected to accomplish a goal which is learning. The entire infrastructure could be seamlessly deployed into the classroom, supporting learning assessment and the feedback process starting from the deployment of a (quasi) real-time intelligent collection system.}

While some existing literature has reviewed commonly used eye-tracking measures and analytical methods across different contexts, there remains a gap in clarifying the educational themes, cognitive theories, and specific cognitive processes most frequently examined in recent eye-tracking studies. To address this, this review synthesizes recent educational eye-tracking research analyzing student cognitive processes from January 2012 to November 2024. In total, 313 articles were reviewed, and several main findings emerged: (1) The majority of eye-tracking studies examined the themes of multimedia learning, reading performance, and problem-solving, while fewer focused on second language learning, computer-based tests, and individual differences. (2) About half of the studies were conducted under one or more theories, with Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), and Dual-coding Theory (DCT) being the most frequently applied. (3) Eye-tracking data were primarily collected from college students, and temporal and count measures were typically used to investigate the cognitive process of information organization rather than those of information selection and integration. (4) Basic statistical methods and linear mixed models were widely used to analyze student attention differences. The results of this review provide theoretical and practical insights into the strengths and challenges of using eye-tracking technology to assess the impact of pedagogical interventions in computer-based learning environments.}

Research suggests that ChatGPT can help students navigate the complexities of STEM subjects. However, only a few studies have directed attention to the use of ChatGPT in STEM subjects in upper secondary education. With the purpose of addressing this gap, the aim of this study is to explore how students experience ChatGPT for their STEM studies, encompassing their usage, perceptions, and general knowledge about this technology. Using a mixed methods approach, the data collected included a survey and semi-structured interviews involving upper secondary students. The results show widespread adoption of ChatGPT across STEM subjects among participants, particularly in biology and especially as a tool to support the understanding of concepts. Although students exhibited limited knowledge of AI, they demonstrated some effective prompting strategies to generate relevant content and tackle potential inaccuracies and hallucinations. The findings in this paper provide insights to support the exploration of students’ experiences of ChatGPT, presenting relevant topics to further research the applications of these AI technologies within STEM subjects, given their importance for future societal development.}

In order to use IVR applications as an effective teaching and learning medium, it is important to understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of this technology compared to other media. This raises the question of what type of learning environment is most effective in promoting specific knowledge and skills. To answer these questions, a systematic review of research on learning with IVR in an educational context was conducted using the PRISMA method (Liberati et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021). The study analyzed 30 relevant research articles to compare the relative effectiveness of IVR-based learning and its impact on learner engagement, as outlined in the ICAP framework (Chi & Wylie, 2014). The results indicate that IVR has a positive impact on learning compared to other types of media. The study suggests that IVR technology is suitable for learning environments that prioritize active learner engagement and practical application, such as active manipulation and constructive creation. In summary, the results offer more insights into the advantages of using IVR to accomplish particular learning objectives.}

This paper identifies the impact of computation delivered by authentic learning experiences in the form of anchored instruction on students' self-beliefs and their capacity to leverage computation to acquire disciplinary concepts in subsequent computationally-based engineering coursework. This case study included 130 students with different programing preparation (authentic or traditional), who were exposed to computational learning modules. Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions is the conceptual framework that guided the evaluation of this investigation. Measures included student self-beliefs such as control and value appraisals, and their relationship with academic performance. Results suggest that programming preparation presented in an authentic engineering context provides an important foundation that goes beyond increasing students' control self-beliefs. This preparation seems to effectively enable students to leverage computational practices for the purpose of acquiring disciplinary concepts. Implications for teaching relate to the integration of computation sooner, more often and within a disciplinary context in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. Implications for learning relate to fostering engineering computational literacy guided by anchored instruction to support disciplinary problem solving.}

Some metrics that quantify the coverage rate of the course syllabus attained by students or their understanding level of knowledge are provided by QLearn. The Artificial Intelligent component of QLearn application uses these measures to make predictions for students’ outcomes at the exam, to find out which topics need to be practised more and to recommend learning plans according to students’ individual needs. The contribution of the paper is therefore twofold. Firstly, we propose a new learning design, based on students’ involvement in a collaborative manner. The second contribution of the paper is QLearn, a software application that provides support (implementation) for the proposed learning process design. Not only does QLearn platform provide a smart learning environment for students, but it also ensures the knowledge transfer from instructors to students in an efficient and effective way.}

abstract = {Digital technologies are increasingly acknowledged for their potential to enrich early childhood learning experiences, particularly in the area of creativity. However, research has tended to focus upon end products and skill development, and little is known about creative development processes. This study sought to explore young children's creative processes as they engaged with three digital coding devices over an eight-week period as part of a Digital Discovery Program. It employed a microethnography to provide nuanced observations of five young children's (aged 4–5 years) interactions and behaviours. Data was collected through approximately 40 hours of video recordings, capturing the dynamic and multimodal aspects of the childrenʼs play and learning experiences. A multimodal interaction analysis was used to examine the multimodal design affordances of each device as mapped against Murcia et al.'s (2020) A-E of Creativity Framework. The findings revealed a clear interplay between digital technologies and various modes of communication, with children demonstrating creativity through their verbal expressions, manipulation of the devices, and spatial understanding of their physical environment. By understanding the multimodal affordances of digital devices aligned with educational frameworks and embracing child-specific definitions of creativity, educators, curriculum designers, policymakers, and researchers can collectively promote creativity and enrich digital learning and play for young children.}

abstract = {Background
Marked advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies throughout industries, including healthcare, necessitate a broader understanding their use. Particularly, intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies and its predictors among nursing students, who are prospective healthcare professionals, is required to promote the utilization of AI.
Objective
This study conducted a path analysis to predict nursing students' intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology.
Design
A cross-sectional survey was performed.
Participants
The participants were 210 nursing students from two nursing schools in Korea.
Methods
This study established hypothetical paths for the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and anxiety on intent to use AI-based technologies. Mediation of positive and negative attitudes and facilitating conditions' direct effects on intent to use were examined.
Results
Positive attitude toward AI (β = 0.485, p = .009) and facilitating conditions (β = 0.117, p = .045) predicted intent to use, whereas the path from negative attitude to intent to use was not significant. Performance expectancy, self-efficacy, and effort expectancy predicted positive attitude. Performance expectancy and self-efficacy had a negative effect on the path to negative attitude, whereas anxiety had a positive effect. Facilitating conditions did not significantly predict positive or negative attitude and only directly predicted intent to use. Social influence did not have a significant effect on intent to use.
Conclusions
Intervention programs and other measures should be developed to provide education and information to boost performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and self-efficacy regarding the use of AI to lower anxiety and foster positive attitude toward AI-based health technologies.}

Teacher training institutions are faced with the central challenge of providing student teachers and teachers with adaptive learning opportunities for their competence in digital areas. In the context of various teaching subjects, this raises questions about specific starting points and the actual needs of students, as well as university course offerings. The present study tackles this topic and explores the commonalities and differences between student teachers from three subject clusters: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); language literature arts (LLA); and social sciences (SOCS). The questionnaire-based study examines student teachers' self-assessments of their abilities in terms of digital media, attitudes, and motivational orientations towards the use of digital media in teaching. Group comparisons show that STEM student teachers rate themselves better in competence facets such as technological knowledge, technological content knowledge, and technological pedagogical knowledge, although their attitudes and motivation towards learning with digital media do not differ. Despite the different interrelation effects of investigated influencing factors on motivation depending on subject clusters, the findings suggest the promotion of technological competencies and positive attitudes to increase motivation.}

The results revealed that, first, female students were more likely to perform well in listening, talking, and integrating during class, and in the quality of posts after class, whereas male students tended to engage more in irrelevant behavior in collaboration. Second, same-gender groups were more active in collaborative discussion, but all-male groups performed worst in quality of posts after class. Third, both male and female students were more active in same-gender groups than in mixed groups. Finally, same-gender groups tended to have greater interpersonal connectedness than mixed-gender groups.

To analyze the evidence available in the literature on the pedagogical practices developed with children through hospital classes.
Method
An integrative review was conducted on July 20, 2022, in Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ERIC, Educ@, and Scielo using the following descriptors in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, extracted from DECS/MeSH, CINAHL, Brased/INEP, and ERIC Thesaurus: “Child, Hospitalized”, “Education, Special”, “Education Department, Hospital”, “Hospital Classroom”, “Hospital Class”, “Child Rearing”, “Educational Practices”, “Early Childhood Education”, “Education”, “Hospital Pedagogy”, and “Hospital Special Class”. No time restriction was applied. The EndNot Web reference manager and the Rayyan software were used to select studies, and later, the methodological rigor and level of evidence were assessed.
Results
The 22 articles described pedagogical practices, including ludic activities, individualized work, working with regular school content, stimulation activities, pedagogical and dialogic listening, learning based on the exchange of knowledge, video games, computational robotics, and theatrical performance.
Conclusion
Although difficulties were identified in implementing pedagogical practices in the hospital, they were shown to allow educational continuity and clinical improvement of hospitalized children.
Implications for practice
Studies on the educational process within the hospital setting can contribute to the development of public policies and the guarantee of the right to education for hospitalized children.

Results show that tse, sociodemographic factors, and school characteristics explain Colombian tdc, whereas only tse explains Korean tdc. Colombian teachers had higher tse than Korean teachers before and after the pandemic. While tse levels decreased for both countries, there was a surprising increase in the means for tse related to ict.

Current efforts may significantly underestimate the role of data, the fundamental component of an AI system. If the goal is to enable students to understand how AI systems work, knowledge of key concepts related to data processing is a prerequisite, as data collection, preparation, and engineering are closely linked to the functionality of AI systems. To advance the field, the following research provides a comprehensive collection of key data-related concepts relevant to K-12 computer science education. These concepts were identified through a theoretical review of the AI field, aligned through a review of AI curricula for school education, evaluated through interviews with domain experts and teachers, and structured hierarchically according to the data lifecycle. Computer science educators can use the elaborated structure as a conceptual guide for designing learning arrangements that aim to enable students to understand how AI systems are created and function.}

To do so, we analyzed the responses to an online survey from 1391 active teachers across 20 countries in the region. This revealed varying understandings of 21st century skills, with little common understanding. Most teachers failed to mention the skills included in the most popular framework (the 4 Cs); those who did reported using the same strategies, regardless of the skill being taught. These strategies included project-based learning, oracy activities, literacy strategies, and teamwork. We conclude that there is little or no common understanding around these skills, nor the best strategies for developing them. Our study helps understand the potential causes preventing the teaching of these skills in the classroom, a problem that extends beyond Latin America.}

We asked 32 participants to assign colour properties (hue and brightness) and emotional categories (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) to stimuli of varying amplitude and angular frequency. We found that perceptions of pleasure and arousal increased with amplitude and angular frequency, but negative and relaxing emotional states were not able to convey. We also found associations between vibrotactile stimuli and colour properties. High amplitude stimuli were linked to warm colours and darker shades, while low amplitude was associated with brighter shades and greater variance in hue. We finish by discussing the causal mechanisms of crossmodal correspondences and contribute a design space for creating multisensory experiences.}

abstract = {Despite the growing body of research on developing K-12 teachers' generative AI (GenAI) knowledge and skills, its integration into daily teaching practices remains underexplored. Using a snowball sampling method, this study examined the preparedness, practices, and barriers encountered by 89 U.S. teachers in the state of Idaho. Participants were predominantly White, female teachers serving in rural schools. A mixed-methods analysis of survey responses revealed that teachers were generally underprepared for integrating GenAI, with fewer than half incorporating it into their educational practices. Unlike the widespread classroom integration patterns observed with general educational technologies, teachers in this study tended to use GenAI for out-of-classroom duties (i.e., lesson preparation, assessment, and administrative tasks) rather than for real-time teaching and learning. These preferences could be attributed to key barriers teachers faced, including doubts about GenAI's ability to manage risks (i.e., technology value beliefs), reduced human interaction in instruction (i.e., pedagogical beliefs), ethical considerations, and the absence of policies and guidance. This study highlights the need to develop support systems and targeted policies to facilitate teachers' GenAI integration, offering implications for Idaho's education system and the broader U.S. context.}

abstract = {Since its introduction, pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) has been widely written about in the science education research literature. It has served as an alluring concept amongst many of the discussions on the teaching and learning of science. This paper reviews and draws together empirical research on a specific PCK lens, consisting of two tools: a Content Representation (CoRe) and Pedagogical and Professional Experiences Repertoires (PaP-eRs). Both tools were originally developed by Loughran et al. (2006) and have since been used by a variety of educational researchers and practitioners within their own contexts. This paper seeks to present how CoRes and PaP-eRs have helped conceptualise and advance PCK research, including the impact this has had on the professional practice of teachers. This paper, in so doing, also demonstrates how this PCK lens can facilitate effective teaching and learning in science education.
Resumen
Desde su aparición, la expresión conocimiento didáctico del contenido (PCK, por sus siglas en inglés) ha sido ampliamente citada en la literatura sobre investigación en las ciencias de la educación, y ha protagonizado muchos de los debates sobre la enseñanza y el aprendizaje de las ciencias. Este artículo revisa y perfila con una mirada específica los PCK, que constan de 2 herramientas: una representación del contenido (CoRe), y un repertorio de experiencias profesionales y pedagógicas (Pap-eRs). Ambas herramientas fueron desarrolladas originalmente por Loughran et al. (2006), y desde entonces han sido empleadas por muchos investigadores y docentes en su contexto particular. El objetivo del presente artículo es mostrar cómo el uso de CoRes y PaP-eRs ha ayudado a conceptualizar y avanzar en la investigación del PCK, incluyendo el impacto que este ha tenido en la práctica profesional de los docentes. Al hacerlo, también se muestra cómo el PCK puede facilitar una enseñanza y un aprendizaje eficaz en educación científica.}

Although previous reviews have examined the impact of PAs on learning and learning-related outcomes, it still remains unclear what specific design features, social cues, and other contextual elements of PA implementation can optimize the learning process. These questions are even more prevalent with regards to the K-12 population, as most reviews to date have largely focused on post-secondary learners. To address this gap in the literature, we systematically review empirical studies around the design of PAs for K-12 learners. After reviewing 1374 studies for potential inclusion, we analyzed 44 studies that met our inclusion criteria using Heidig and Clarebout's (2011) frameworks. Our findings showed that learners had preferences for specific types of PAs. While these preferences were not always associated with increased learning outcomes, there is a lack of research specifically investigating the intersection of perceptions and learning. Our results also showed that pedagogical strategies that are effective for human teachers were effective when used by PAs. We highlight what specific design features instructional designers can use to design PAs for K-12 learners and discuss promising research directions based on the extant work in the field.}

Moreover, this loss of competencies can reduce their employment opportunities while society itself is deprived of that human capital. Remote laboratories have emerged as a way of countering the effects of insufficient investment in equipment or the inability to acquire the latter. By way of example, the goal of Project R3, which is presented in this article, is to reduce the absence or shortage of laboratories in the rural world via the use of remote experimentation. Specifically, this article presents the experience, the results, and the main conclusions of Project R3 during its first year of life. It is worth noting that Project R3 has been deployed not only in rural but also in urban environments, making it possible to compare learning results and satisfaction levels for students in both spheres and identify those experiments that provide the best learning experience and are most popular among pupils and teachers. The main objective is that from the local analysis (the Project has only been conducted in Spain) it might be possible to draw conclusions of a global nature that might be extrapolated to other countries in the European Union with similar socio-demographics. Initial results are in the direction of certifying that student achievement and satisfaction are higher in rural than in urban environments.}

In the process of computations the data is connected with semantic characteristics that describe the channel of computations, which can be considered as a method of semantic data enrichment. The system of information channels as a whole can be considered as an information graph describing the structuring of the processed data. The information graph supports the data model in the form of a network, the framework of which are objects and the relationships between them. The paper proposes language tools for determining the information graph and interpretation tools that provide practical computations. The set of information channels that make up the information graph can be considered as a low-level tool for data enrichment. The paper studies the possibility of determining tools of higher level. An applicative type language is proposed for defining information graphs, the syntax and semantics of the language are specified. The proposed language can be considered as an intermediate level tool for defining semantics. A procedure is proposed for compiling the language into a low-level construct, preserving the semantics of the language. The supporting system for the proposed computing system includes a low-level language interpreter, as well as an intermediate-level language compiler into a low-level language. The supporting system is implemented in an applicative programming environment. Some elements of the supporting system were tested when developing applied information systems in the field of jurisprudence.}

Nowadays, car wash facilities give numerous car wash or car detailing services such as foam washing, waxing, and polishing, which are handy for consumers. However, there are certain limits revealed that customers must queue up for a long period till their turn. During busy hours, clients could have to wait for a few hours, which wastes customers’ time. Besides, it is problematic for people living in apartments because there is no place for them to wash their cars. Other than that, most individuals are frightened to leave their homes because worried about the COVID-19 virus. Hence, the recommended solutions in this application can address the issues by integrating the booking system while being online. The Mobile Application Development Life Cycle (MADLC) has been used as a methodology for the entire research, including all phases except the deployment and maintenance phases. The purpose of this research is to make it more convenient for the user by providing door-to-door vehicle wash services at shopping malls, parking lots, places of employment, residential driveways, and other locations.}

If critical thinking is seen as a complex mix of knowledge, skills and dispositions that can be articulated and made an object of study in themselves, then there is scope for intentional and explicit targeting of such things. If, however, critical thinking is seen as a general skill more or less impermeable to pedagogical influence and best realised through the development of content knowledge, then an explicit focus on developing thinking skills is misplaced and potentially distracting. The latter view is that of cognitive load theory (CLT), a theoretical framing of thinking and learning that has gained traction in education including with practitioners. This paper will explore some of the assumptions of CLT and show that they are either (1) in error, (2) vaguely or confusingly expressed and/or (3) the conclusions drawn within the theory are often errors of inference. Moreover, I point out that important educational research that weakens the claims of CLT is often not engaged with or addressed.}

This study proposes a framework for designing personalized project-based learning (P-PjBL) experiences. To evaluate the effectiveness of P-PjBL, this study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, a two-tier diagnostic test was developed using data from over 1,000 students. Subsequently, students’ prior knowledge and understanding were assessed through the diagnostic test, and personalized activities and resources were created based on the test results. In the second stage, 106 fourth-grade students were divided into three groups and participated in a three-period unit. Control Group 1 followed traditional teaching methods, Control Group 2 engaged in general project-based learning (G-PjBL), and the Experimental Group used P-PjBL. The results indicated that P-PjBL can effectively improve academic performance and reduce the student performance gap. Notably, P-PjBL had a more positive effect on students with moderate prior knowledge than those with limited prior knowledge. Moreover, students with higher-level prior knowledge demonstrated greater improvement in P-PjBL than those with low-level prior knowledge. These findings provide valuable insight into the potential benefits of P-PjBL for improving academic performance.}

AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.}

Using the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, a systematic literature review was conducted on management education research relating to COVID-19 published between 2020 and 2022. A total of 56 relevant articles were found in and retrieved from the Web of Science database and subsequently analyzed using descriptive and content analyses. The descriptive analysis revealed a steep increase in research on the impact of COVID-19 on management education over time, with most research appearing in The International Journal of Management Education. The contributions came from various countries, with the top five being the USA, the UK, Australia, India, and China. The content analysis showed that most research adopted empirical methodologies while self-determination theory emerged as the most popular theoretical lens for study. The related research revolved around five major themes—i.e., digital teaching and learning, collaboration and partnership, embracing uncertainty and building resilience, transformation and innovation, and developing an entrepreneurial mindset—and provided implications for management education in the new normal, wherein the priority is focused on enhancing education quality and preparing future business leaders for profound challenges in the new normal, thereby necessitating the development of innovative pedagogies and leadership competencies.}

Drawing inspiration from taxonomies within the field of Information Visualization, we derived a framework for the analysis of educational tools in this domain comprising four categories: supported goals, expressiveness, abstraction, and transparency. We situate six existing BBP environments within the design space of the framework and illustrate its application by describing the design of PlayData, a BBP environment developed to address a gap in data visualization tools for young audiences. Our goal is to contribute to a more theoretically grounded discussion on the topic by connecting well-established research on professional tools for data visualization and the design of related educational environments targeted at middle and high school students.}

Early education has a huge impact on the further development of children, so preschool teachers must be competent and use appropriate teaching and educational methods. In this study, the development of self-directed learning (SDL) of future preschool teachers is investigated by considering two variables, namely the type of study (full-time and part-time students) and the learning modalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-, during and post-COVID-19 confinement). We collected data from 418 participants and analysed them using descriptive statistics, 2 × 3 factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a two-step cluster analysis. The results show the status of pre-service preschool teachers' perceptions of their SDL development and how the variables influenced it. There were significant differences in the students' self-reported SDL skills, depending on the learning environment and the type of study. The status indicator helps educators identify and change the curriculum and how they work with students. It allows the faculty to highlight the positive aspects of the different educational modalities encountered, as well as the characteristics of the study types and their impact on the learning process to improve students’ SDL skills. The results of the study may help in the design of tailored metacognitive scaffolds that take into account different modalities. Further studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of digital open learning environments that address both SDL and preschool educational practices.}

Therefore, learning opportunities that foster creativity and reasonable promote the so-called ‘maker mindset’ are requested to speed up business innovation and stay competitive within an increasingly turbulent market. The demand for Internet-of-Things-Laboratories will be underlined based on a gap analysis. For this purpose, the key aspects of a previously designed “Industry 4.0” competence profile (to fit the requirements of a digitized industry) and a content analysis regarding the learning objectives of mechanical engineering curricula are taken into account. Afterwards, the conceptual design of the IoT-Lab – attracting three target groups (high school students, undergraduates and graduates as well as representatives of industry) and including a strong focus to action-oriented learning – will be presented in detail. Each workshop covers design and production of the housing – using additive manufacturing –, the sensor and / or circuit configuration, the programming process and integration into the IoT-Labs’ or any other network system.}

abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence into education has emerged as a promising avenue for enriching teaching and learning experiences. Nevertheless, the successful implementation of artificial intelligence in educational contexts hinges upon various factors, one of which is the perspective of instructors. With this in mind, this study aimed to examine the perspectives of 536 instructors in STEM and non-STEM disciplines regarding AI integration. The respondents’ thoughts, opinions, and concerns regarding advantages, disadvantages and challenges were gathered through an online questionnaire featuring both closed and open-ended questions. Additionally, a series of semi-structured interview sessions were conducted with a cohort of instructors to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The findings revealed that both STEM and non-STEM instructors expressed positive attitudes toward the integration of AI technologies into education. However, notable differences in responses and concerns were also identified in relation to the perceived capabilities and limitations of AI technologies within educational contexts. The results further elucidated a spectrum of opinions on the benefits (e.g., scalability and tirelessness), drawbacks (e.g., deepfake technology and comfort-seeking behavior), and potential challenges (e.g., educational disillusionment and espionage) associated with AI integration. The study concluded by discussing the implications of these findings for STEM and non-STEM education and offering recommendations for the effective and ethical integration of AI technologies in classrooms.}

However, this literature is dominated by game-play approaches, rather than game-making approaches. Drawing upon constructivist, motivation, dual-coding, and constructionist theories, this study examined elementary English language learners’ vocabulary learning experiences in a game-based learning context and investigated their experience as they built their own games based on their understanding of different non-fiction texts. This mixed-methods case study involved novel use of network analysis to examine student learning, investigate the relationships between various aspects of learner experiences, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the program. Findings indicated that a complex set of interdependencies between enactments of theoretical principles including generativity, agency, tinkering, intrinsic motivation, and contextualized learning lead to enjoyment and powerful language learning experiences. Design principles for future digital game-based language learning include optimizing visual aspects, spending more time on technical skill development, increasing learner agency, and focusing more on generative and joyful learning experiences.}

Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a sample of 200 Arab and Jewish teachers in Israel completed online questionnaires. The findings indicated a positive attitude towards AI among teachers. We found a significant positive correlation between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and positive attitude towards AI. TSE fully mediated the relationship between attitude towards AI and adoption intentions AI, while a SOC partially mediated the relationship between TSE and teachers' attitude towards AI. The findings underscore the importance of developing TSE and fostering a SOC among teachers as part of the AI implementation process in the education system. The findings offer a new understanding of AI technology adoption processes in education by incorporating psychological variables into the TAM framework and providing practical insights for decision-makers in the Israeli education system and beyond.}

It reflects on the value that is promised for tertiary education, teaching, and learning. Separating hype from the realistic possibilities, the connections between advances in technology, policy, and development challenges are critically examined to consider how the 4IR could impact on tertiary education, and teaching and learning, in the future. It then proceeds to examine the enabling conditions which need to be cultivated at national, institutional, and individual levels, and the challenges and obstacles to be overcome at these levels, for enduring benefits to be realized. The paper explores what the phenomenon of the 4IR is, drawing on the arguments of key proponents, including skeptics. It explores what kinds of changes are envisaged as the phenomenon progresses. It then proceeds to examine how institutions may be positioned to harness the 4IR for the benefit of human wellbeing, and in support of national and international social and economic benefits. The promise of the 4IR to resolve our developmental challenges has been sharply questioned—perhaps being overhyped, given existing and enduring disadvantage and marginalization that was not ameliorated in previous industrial revolutions. These are elaborated upon. At the institutional level, more sophisticated use of digital technology is called for—in administration, teaching, learning support, and e-learning. Online data and information management; aggregation of vast amounts of data; and analyses of data for student success and student support promise a positive impact on success and throughput rates. Key imperatives for action include redesigning, streamlining, and aligning the education system. This requires flexibility in admission criteria, curriculum design, learning and teaching modes, and assessment, with appropriate support systems and services across the institution.}

Despite findings suggesting various benefits of social robot use in schools, clinics, and homes, stakeholders have voiced concerns about the potential social and emotional effects of children engaging in long-term interactions with robots. Given the challenges of conducting large long-term studies of child-robot interaction (CRI), little is known about the impact of CRI on children’s socio-emotional development. Here we summarize the literature on predictions and expectations of teachers, parents, therapists, and children regarding the effects of CRI on children’s socio-emotional functioning and skill building. We then highlight the limited body of empirical research examining how CRI affects children’s social behavior and emotional expression, and we provide a summary of available questionnaires for measuring socio-emotional constructs relevant to CRI. We conclude with design recommendations for research studies aimed at better understanding the effects of CRI, before social robots become ubiquitous. This review is relevant to researchers, educators, roboticists, and clinicians interested in designing and using social robots with developmental populations.}

This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings.}

Considerable studies explore the necessary integrated learning perspectives, emphasizing AI's adaptive role as a mind tool. In AI-mediated language learning, the technology's metacognitive importance enables students to learn with AI as a partner, encouraging independent critical thinking. Within Zimmerman's SRL model, AI as a mind tool is integrated for improving language students' strategic employment in a cyclical process. A systematic review, following PRISMA protocols, examines the intersection of AI and self-regulated language learning (SRLL) over 2000–2022. Findings highlight AI's evolving role, predominantly through algorithms and systems, aiming for micro and macro integration. Interactive AI has not fully engaged in two-way directions, despite a familiar process approach in reviewed studies. In the favored ESL/EFL research context, task-specific AI is utilized to encourage cyclical improvement with learner autonomy enhancement mainly among higher education students at intermediate level or above. Pedagogical values are possible when major SRL phases are fully practiced, even without highly autonomous AI. Future research is directed toward adaptive personalized technology by exploring the dynamic interplay between AI technologies and SRLL as educational practices under Education 4.0 principles.}

The study focuses on the Maker mindsets transformation of three students with varying abilities, deliberately chosen as information-rich participants. A project-specific questionnaire, the Maker Mindsets Scale, was employed to facilitate self-assessment of Maker mindsets before and after intervention. Additionally, teachers' post-lesson discussion meetings were observed, and semi-structured interviews with participating teachers were conducted to gauge their perceptions of students' Maker mindsets transformation. The analysis encompassed students' semi-structured reflection logs and interviews to uncover the underlying factors driving Maker mindsets transformation. The results revealed distinct variations in how students of different abilities perceived their Maker mindsets transformation. Nonetheless, participant teachers consistently observed transformations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) thinking skills, self-efficacy, motivation, and collaborative learning across all students. The study further identifies a collaborative convergence of multiple factors contributing to Maker mindsets transformation, spanning teacher, student, and pedagogical perspectives. These findings carry significant implications for educators, advocating for the implementation of customized strategies, authentic contextualization, structured methodologies, and collaborative frameworks to holistically nurture Maker mindsets evolution. Moreover, our study underscores the practicality of the LS approach in fostering collaborative development of innovative pedagogical strategies aimed at fostering Maker mindsets formation.}

While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative AI integration in educational practice.}

Less is known, however, about how programming games afford learning and playing by design. To address this, we performed a qualitative, comparative analysis of 19 programming games from an instructional and game attributes perspective. The findings showed that a majority of programming games presents only a moderate alignment with established instructional principles. Furthermore, significant differences in the presence and prevalence of their game attributes were found. Our analysis resulted in a systematic classification of programming games according to their alignment with instructional principles and their positioning on a playing-versus-programming spectrum. Informed by this twofold classification, we explored whether particular programming games can still be conceptualized as games, as opposed to learning or programming environments. Accordingly, we formulated opportunities and restrictions towards their potential context-of-use.}

This study therefore explored the research trends of AIRE by conducting a systematic review of SSCI (Social Sciences Citation Index) journal articles published in the Web of Science (WoS). The study analyzed the participants, duration of the studies, learning environments, application domains, data analysis, evaluations of learners' performance, learning strategies, roles of AI-robots, and research issues. The research findings are concluded as follows: (1) The countries of Canada, Chile, and South Korea invested in AIRE research early, and focused on students' learning performance and learning behavior. (2) Most AIRE research focuses on research targets under the age of 13 and completed experiments within 4 weeks in a physical environment. Most AIRE research has been applied in the disciplines of Language and Science, and problem-solving related strategies and mixed strategies are the most commonly used strategies. (3) AI-robots are often applied and regarded as tutees or tutors. Regardless of what the AI-robot's role is, learning performance is the most widely focused variable in AIRE research. Furthermore, attitudes, opinions of learners or learning perceptions and learning behavior are other frequently discussed themes. To sum up, this study makes several recommendations for AIRE research for educators, researchers, and policy makers in higher education settings as a reference based on the results.}

Elsewhere in neurobiology, a computational revolution has shown that mathematical models of hidden biological mechanisms can bridge observations with theory building. Can we build a similar computational framework yielding mechanistic insights for brain development? Here, we outline the conceptual and technical challenges of addressing this theory gap, and demonstrate that there is great potential in specifying brain development as mathematically defined processes operating within physical constraints.

abstract = {Individuals’ computer skills have long been noteworthy for both education and the labor market. Although the support provided through curricula in schools develops these skills to a certain extent, digital divide still exists for individuals with different socio-demographic characteristics. The concept of digital divide, used to define individuals who do not have equal access to digital technologies, has started to be seen as a determining factor for digital competencies with its expanding scope. The current study aims to take a perspective to investigate the effect of socio-demographic variables, which may cause digital divide, on students' ICT literacy. With this study, it is sought to explain the effect of current inequalities regarding digital access on students' ICT skills. To this end, the socio-demographic characteristics of the students in the sample of Korea and Chile from the participating countries of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) were examined in the context of ICT literacy. The characteristics of the models created were compared for both countries. While parents’ level of education variable stands out for the Chilean model, the internet connection variable is remarkable for the Korean model. It is anticipated that the findings of the research will contribute to understanding the dynamics of the digital divide and its possible consequences, and can be a source for preventive policy steps to be developed.}

abstract = {In recent years, we have seen many examples of software products unintentionally causing demonstrable harm. Many guidelines for ethical and responsible computing have been developed in response. Dominant approaches typically attribute liability and blame to individual companies or actors, rather than understanding how the working practices, norms, and cultural understandings in the software industry contribute to such outcomes. In this paper, we propose an understanding of responsibility that is infrastructural, relational, and cultural; thus, providing a foundation to better enable responsible software engineering into the future. Our approach draws on Young's (2006) social connection model of responsibility and Star and Ruhleder's (1994) concept of infrastructure. By bringing these theories together we introduce a concept called infrastructural injustice, which offers a new way for software engineers to consider their opportunities for responsible action with respect to society and the planet. We illustrate the utility of this approach by applying it to an Open-Source software communities’ development of Deepfake technology, to find key leverage points of responsibility that are relevant to both Deepfake technology and software engineering more broadly.}

However, fostering robust social relationships among objects within intelligent environments requires considering a multitude of parameters, from historical transactions data to peer opinions on interaction experiences. Our primary objective is to introduce the VISO concept, a finely tuned approach for community formation and facilitating autonomous interactions among Social IoT objects. Key contributions of VISO include: (i) a recommendation mechanism for cultivating friendships; (ii) the virtualization of devices, known as Virtual Objects, based on the Digital Twin concept; (iii) object ranking, determined by peer evaluations at the edge; and (iv) profiling the identity of each object within the environment. The VISO approach is rooted in the link analysis model, which seeks to uncover connections between individuals and qualify interactions. Additionally, the construction of social circles is guided by the Organizational Network Analysis model, a concept grounded in social networks designed to simplify the initiation of new friendships. The VISO approach stands out through its amalgamation of dynamic trust mechanisms, object virtualization, real-time interaction monitoring, and the highlighting of the most active objects. These characteristics collectively contribute to its effectiveness in managing relationships within the social IoT, while simultaneously addressing challenges posed by alternative models. Preliminary results in a testing environment substantiate the model’s capability to categorize interactions and identify the most beneficial object roles for establishing new relationships. In particular, by selecting the most active objects 30%, they account for a staggering 90% of local actions. These validation outcomes lay the foundation for planned future work and enhancements to the VISO approach. Encouraged by the promising results, the inception of a significant project is on the horizon. The application of the VISO approach to relationship management within a smart campus for ubiquitous education underscores the remarkable versatility and potential of Social IoT. This application has the power to elevate various facets of campus life, ranging from education to resource management, creating a transformative impact within the educational landscape.}

Game designers shape player agency by including alternative storylines, optional objectives, and developing a range of mechanics thereby enriching player experience with novelty and variety during gameplay. So far, there is a dearth of studies that focus on giving autonomy to players over the use of learning mechanic in educational games. This study explores the impact of providing players with the autonomy over the use of learning mechanic. Students interacted with two versions of a computer programming game prototype differing in the level of player agency in terms of freedom to employ the learning mechanics during gameplay. We employed quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate if player agency affected students’ learning outcomes, game enjoyment, and intrinsic motivation to learn. The results have implications for design of educational games, suggesting that incorporating player agency, particularly in the context of choosing learning mechanics, can enhance enjoyment and intrinsic motivation without compromising the educational effectiveness of the game.}

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the need to equip young students with basic AI-related knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10–12.
Aims
This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment.
Sample
One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72).
Methods
Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance.
Results
The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety.
Conclusions
The DCP approach significantly improved students’ learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy. This study highlights the pedagogical value of human-AI comparisons in teaching AI, while contributing to a research agenda on the cognitive and conceptual aspects of AI education.}

abstract = {Background
In the etiology of functional chest pain (FCP), parental personality traits are worth considering in the context of the biopsychosocial model. The αlpha factor sub-dimension of the five-factor personality model (5FPM) includes agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. There is increasing evidence that this dimension may be related to psychosomatic diseases. It was aimed to investigate how maternal personality traits affect adolescents with FCP. The hypothesis was determined that adolescents diagnosed with FCP can have lower quality of life and be more depressive/anxious and their mothers can have factor-α personality traits and be more depressive/anxious.
Methods
The sample of this single-center, cross-sectional, case-control study consisted of 25 adolescents with FCP and their parents. The control group consisted of 35 age and sex matched healthy adolescents and their parents. Psychopathology was screened using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and psychiatric comorbidities were excluded. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and KINDL forms were completed by the adolescents. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Five-Factor Personality Inventory short form (FFPI) were completed by the parents.
Results
Mothers of adolescents with FCP scored significantly higher compared with mothers of healthy controls in agreeableness and conscientiousness and scored significantly lower in neuroticism. Higher levels of mothers’ neuroticism scores were associated with higher CDI and STAI-1 scores in FCP group. Agreeableness (Exp (B) = 10.097; p = .004; confidence interval [CI] = 2.049-49.745) and conscientiousness (Exp (B) = 16.414; p = .011; CI = 1.902-141.682) were statiscally significant in regression model.
Conclusions
This study showed for the first time that mother's alpha factor personality traits may be one of the factors that contribute to the presence of FCP.}

The opportunity landscape involves collecting systems-driven data sets corresponding to organizations, places, barriers and supports that collectively shape the opportunities available to youth, families, and educators. Understanding and utilizing this landscape is crucial to fully accounting for youth progress along STEM pathways. Such awareness is vital as stakeholders often operate in silos and may not fully grasp how their impact areas within the ecosystem intersect with others. For example, how do school-based out-of-school time opportunities affect programming at local parks and libraries? How does reduced bus fare impact kids' ability to move around the city after school and on weekends? How do employers create pathways for entry-level staff? Our work aims to create a cohesive landscape that brings together stakeholders, their insights, and affordances and creates opportunities for all. This paper describes the design efforts that led to one city's summer 2023 youth STEM learning opportunities. We discuss the phases of our work and approach to collaborative design with community and organizational partners to apply insights and create opportunities that increase youth freedom of movement and access to resources. We provide specific examples to illustrate the impact of our design.}

In this project, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify how DC has been operationalized in teaching practices to date. The findings reveal that DC is often used as an umbrella term for technology-related learning tasks that nevertheless fail to actively engage students in practicing DC in a critical manner. In addition, older students are often asked to develop DC in project-based learning outside the school setting. While interdisciplinary approaches to DC have been proposed, disciplines such as philosophy or ecology—apparently necessary to work on citizenship—are not considered. Finally, digital tools/environments are never questioned and always imposed; as such, a critical approach to DC is not explicitly developed in the classroom. This literature review discusses the practical implications of the current state of research.}

Using the Saudi Arabia context, this paper investigates teachers’ perspectives regarding the implementation of online education to support 21st century skills in the COVID-19 pandemic era for K-3 elementary school students. A qualitative research methodology was applied in this study. A semi-structured interview was conducted to collect data from five K-3 female teachers who implemented online education during the pandemic. Three themes emerged from the findings: 1) effects of the pandemic as related to online teaching for attainment of 21st century skills, 2) elaboration of best practices for online teaching to facilitate such attainment, and 3) challenges that exist for distance learning and student acquisition of 21st century skills. Therefore, the findings suggest that elementary teachers should find opportunities for elementary students to experience distance learning as an ongoing learning solution in order to incorporate innovative strategies that enhance their 21st century skills.}

The study explored the digital competencies that are deemed important by project managers in managing projects in the digital economy. Q-methodology was used to determine potential perspectives, and three confirming perspectives and one emergent perspective were identified. The main competence deemed important is online communication and collaboration, whereas cybersecurity is deemed unimportant. This study is the first of its kind and provides insight into the digital intelligence of project leaders. It contributes to the current debate around the future digital competencies and skills that are required.

abstract = {In gamification, personalization is considered an important field of research since it can improve user engagement and motivation. Particularly, effective gamified learning needs to strike a balance between gameful design that promotes engagement and does not negatively affect content comprehension and absorption. The existing traditional user-type questionnaires approaches are time-consuming and intrusive, hampering the user’s focus. Previous research in gamification demonstrated how to automate player profile creation through log file analysis of gameful systems instead of traditional approaches, however, psychological archetypes and motivational groups can simplify the process of collecting data to achieve a balanced level of personalization for gamified systems, which are grounded on the user’s profile and preferences which can help with their immersion. To attend to the needs of a wide range of fields that introduce gamification to systems that are not classified as games, a new ludic approach was created to define user types based on user interaction using symbolic images. In this exploratory research, we tested this approach in two card-sorting studies (N=35 and N=19). Our results show that the images can be used to predict the users’ archetypes and motivational groups accurately. Thus, we contribute with validating an image-based user type classification method that is easier to deploy in systems that do not aim to behave as a game but are looking to reap the benefits of personalizing a user’s content and gameful experience where relevant. Our second contribution is delivering guidelines to replicate this validation method to other existing approaches. We expect that with this guideline, we facilitate personalization with other user typologies without disrupting the gameful experience.}

abstract = {This paper highlights the importance of evaluating educational technology for children in naturalistic classroom contexts. We present the train the teacher method (TTM) which formalizes a method for IDC researchers to use when deploying and validating an educational system. Our key findings indicate the need to work in partnership with classroom teachers, providing both initial training and continued support. This will both result in more valuable research data, and address a gap in teachers’ continued professional development. The TTM aims to ensure that teachers, students, and researchers can benefit from innovative educational systems deployed in real classroom contexts. We believe that the TTM could be adapted to other domains of study within interaction design community. The paper goes on to argue the more general point that the interaction design and children community should shift emphasis away from technology innovation and towards reporting replicable longitudinal research findings from real-world settings. We discuss possible approaches to achieving this, for example through changes to reviewing criteria and by actively supporting data and source code sharing.}

They are the base artefacts in many engineering activities, such as product configuration, derivation, or testing. Concrete models in different domains exist; however, many are in private or sparse repositories or belong to discontinued projects. The dispersion of knowledge of feature models hinders the study and reuse of these artefacts in different studies. The Universal Variability Language (UVL) is a community effort textual feature model language that promotes a common way of serializing feature models independently of concrete tools. Open science principles promote transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research. Although some attempts exist to promote feature model sharing, the existing solutions lack open science principles by design. In addition, existing and public feature models are described using formats not always supported by current tools. This paper presents , a repository of feature models in UVL format. provides a front end that facilitates the search, upload, storage, and management of feature model datasets, improving the capabilities of discontinued proposals. Furthermore, the tool communicates with Zenodo – one of the most well-known open science repositories – providing a permanent save of datasets and following open science principles. includes existing datasets and is readily available to include new data and functionalities in the future.

Google Earth Engine, and random forest algorithm, are used to generate a dataset that help to investigate this question. A regression is performed on double differenced data to investigate the effects of interest. A k-mean cluster analysis, is also used to determine whether the distribution patterns of crop production changed with drought and disruption of agricultural production input. Results show that: (1) droughts affected the agricultural production of both areas similarly. Crop cover declined in both areas for one season after droughts were broken. Then recovery was driven by greener, more productive crops rather than the expansion of crop area. (2) The response of both areas to the COVID-19 lockdown was also similar. Both smallholder and commercial areas' Normalised Difference Vegetation Index – a proxy for crop vitality – improved in response to regulations favourable to the sector and improved rainfall. No significant adjustments in crop cover were observed. Production therefore changed primarily at the intensive margin (improved productivity of existing croplands) rather than the extensive (changing the extent of land under cultivation). (3) Cluster analysis allows for a more granular view, showing that the positive impact of lockdowns on agriculture were concentrated in areas with high rainfall and close proximity to metropolitan markets. Both smallholder and commercial farmers therefore are reliant on market access together with favourable environmental conditions for improved production.}

This paper presents an investigation of fourth- and fifth-grade students engaging in Making activities to create simulation, concept-process, and illustrative models in the science classroom. Based on video analyses of the Making-based class sessions, a generalized process model was developed for each type of science model. In addition, cross-cutting themes were found in Making-based science modeling: first, there are two loops that intersect and interact with each other (modeling for Making and modeling for Science content), and they interrelate in various ways depending on science model type; and second, showcasing Making products (sharing with peers, teachers, or helpers) is a primary factor that determines students’ overall engagement with science in the activity. We suggest that Making-based science kit and lesson design needs to support students to showcase their Making output, on top of science-related reflections, and to consider the balance between Making and science activity. We conclude that Making has the potential to support the development of scientific model thinking in the elementary science classroom, but much further research is needed in this area.}

Throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. In this vein, Zhang, Kirschner, Cobern, and Sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. In the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. We review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. We show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. We subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students' prior knowledge and other student characteristics. Furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. Therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. We conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students’ investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures.}

As guiding heuristics, the protocol used two provisional design principles based on teaching experience and previous studies that have applied tools for formulating questions, notably, the question formulation technique, SMART goals, and a typology of investigable and non-investigable questions. Two cycles comprising six lesson interventions were completed with two groups (n = 23, n = 25) of students in the same school in Malaysia. Questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and a question typology framework. Findings show the majority of students formulated comparison, exploratory, and validation of mental model questions. Some questions were posed in the prediction, descriptive, and problem-solving categories, but none were categorized as cause and effect, design and make, or pattern seeking. Implications for use of the IQFT protocol to help facilitate Malaysian students’ generation of investigable questions, design experiments, and implement open inquiry are discussed.}

Four aspects of psychological distance—temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical distance—and immersion are introduced to identify the mechanism. Through a two (with versus without metaphor) by two (with versus without board writing) between-subject experimental design, 193 participants were randomly assigned to one of four sets of video lectures on the gradient descent method, followed by an online questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the research model. The results demonstrate that metaphor has a significant effect on all four aspects of psychological distance and immersion, while board writing has an impact only on hypothetical distance. Social distance mediates the relationship between metaphor and learning performance, recommendation intention, and continuance intention; hypothetical distance mediates the interplay between metaphor, board writing, and learning performance; and immersion mediates the link between metaphor and recommendation intention.}

The existing literature on game jam learning consists mostly of descriptive individual case studies, with very incohesive and varied research aims, methods, and settings. Thus far, there have been no attempts to further analyze and classify the reported results of the previous studies. This article looks at existing research on game jams and learning, comparing the reported learning results to the future-oriented skills and knowledge. The data set, created utilizing the PRISMA checklist, consists of 25 original articles published between 2010 and 2022. The results show that participation in a game jam event will likely increase interdisciplinary, epistemic, and procedural knowledge. Furthermore, it can increase disciplinary knowledge depending on the theme and other framings of the event. Participation in a game jam event will likely further cognitive and metacognitive skills as well as social and emotional skills, provided the jam event is organized to create a safe and inclusive space for learning. Participation in a game jam will also likely further diverse practical and physical skills, but the adoption of these skills varies depending on individuals’ tasks inside their team. ICT-related skills are furthered in jam events concentrating on digital games and can be supported when making non-digital games. Thus, game jams offer a well-suited method for learning future-oriented skills and knowledge.}

Traditional methods often fall short, failing to capture individuals’ attention and ignite their motivation to actively participate in the knowledge transmission process. This article introduces Colearnis, a novel knowledge transmission platform, which allows peers to transfer knowledge in a gamified manner by using videos and quizzes which are directly created by the employees. This article also presents a long-term field study investigating the use of Colearnis with 130 employees in a worldwide metallurgy and tooling company. A multi-dimensional evaluation approach makes use of user surveys and behavior-tracking data to explore prospective avenues which might benefit knowledge transmission. Users have been profiled under demographical and managerial aspects, however also under their gamification user types according to the Hexad framework for gamification design. This study explores the connections between user profiles and engagement behaviors within Colearnis. The findings suggest that factors such as; age influence the achiever and philanthropist user types, however also that individuals with greater managerial duties are more likely to be classified as socializer, free-spirit, or philanthropist user types. Additionally, this study suggests that socializer or disruptor user types are more likely to consume or react to peers’ self-created knowledge. On the other hand, achiever user profiles are less likely to react or start quizzes. These findings equip organizations with valuable insights to further design and implement engaging ad-hoc knowledge transmission systems. These systems could be further tailored to align with individuals’ managerial profiles and gamification user types, optimizing engagement and increasing the likelihood of successful knowledge transmission.}

Distributed smart microgrid technology allows for the efficient integration of sustainable resources to provide localised energy delivery at improved levels of reliability and resilience. Smart energy management in decentralised renewable systems requires computational intelligence to implement pivotal energy-aware/cost-aware procedures in decision-making for a conceptualised next generation Smart Village microgrid platform. Smart Village microgrid control automation aims at offering pragmatic and, intelligent control capabilities to perform price-based demand response energy management. This paper proposes the use of cascaded control abstraction in the implementation of a price-sensitive cyber-physical Smart Grid approach in a rural off-grid microgrid environment. The modular microgrid design integrates renewable energy resources through an adaptive control algorithm developed in a model-based design approach. The solution is based on distributed market-based control, using multi-agent transactive principles to navigate automated demand response. Multi-priority load clusters with the selective parallel control of non-intelligent device groups allow for prioritised supply/demand resource coordination. The proposed Smart Village solution operates as a self-regulating smart microgrid energy management system and by virtue of its market-based transactive reasoning approach is able to meet multiple operating requirements of rural village energy systems. Simulation results for this value-based control technique highlight the value of customer engagement combined with supply-, demand- and economic cost optimisation for hybrid renewable distributed energy microgrids.}

We found different DC components were included at different grade levels and some components were not present at all. To help address the uneven distribution of these components, we developed four DC inclusive science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) books related to the topic of energy. These books were designed with the DCF to foster rich DC learning experiences in school science. We engaged 13 teachers as consultants in a validation process when developing the DC inclusive STEAM books. This study describes the development and implementation of the DCF for preparing supplemental science curriculum materials that can improve students’ appreciation for DC.

From the resulting analysis of 49 studies, this study investigates the contextual characteristics by AI-supported interaction type, AI application, target language, educational level, etc. Moreover, three research paradigms are identified in this emerging field, i.e., Paradigm One (AI-directed, teacher-as-facilitator, learner-as-recipient), Paradigm Two (AI/teacher-codirected, learner-as-collaborator), and Paradigm Three (AI/teacher/learner-codirected). The paradigms are induced through analysis of eight constructs: human-AI relationship, learning objective, task type, level of pre-structuring, mode of engagement behavior, knowledge-change process, cognitive outcome, and research focus. The philosophical and linguistic underpinnings for each paradigm are discussed. Additionally, we highlight future research implications including investigating under-researched themes and exploring diverse methodological possibilities and appropriateness among the three research paradigms.}

abstract = {Teachers' professional development is crucial for effective classroom practice. Due to its advantages, many teachers have participated in online professional development (OPD) in recent years. Numerous studies have investigated the participation and effect of first to 12th grade in-service teachers' OPD participation on the teacher, classroom practice, or student level. However, a comprehensive meta-analysis of these studies is missing. This meta-analysis summarizes findings from 102 quantitative studies with a pre-posttest design. The results indicate medium effects of OPD participation on the teacher level (Hedges' g = 0.71) and on the classroom level (Hedges' g = 0.55) and a small effect on the student level (Hedges' g = 0.19). We included Desimones' (2009) core features of effective PD participation as moderators. We found that the core feature of collective participation positively influenced the effect size of the classroom level. Furthermore, we found that studies that employed a control-group design reported significantly lower effect sizes on teacher-level outcomes than studies that used a within-subject design. On the student's level, studies with asynchronous OPD reported significantly smaller effect sizes than studies with a synchronous OPD format. Our results aim to provide research, policymakers, educational stakeholders, and teachers with the clarity that OPD is effective on several levels and should, therefore, be encouraged.}

Therefore, this study investigates how people perceive and evaluate AI-generated content and accounts compared to human-created accounts and content. We created Instagram accounts representing AI, influencers, and the public and conducted a user study with 43 participants. The participants had difficulty distinguishing AI accounts from human ones. Moreover, there were significant differences in user perceptions concerning the three account types. Participants perceived the AI and influencer accounts as more attractive than the public account, and they rated the quality of AI-generated content as highly as that created by influencers. These findings suggest that the advancement of generative AI could alter the social media landscape and contribute to discussions on the characteristics and ethical problems of AI-generated content.}

Teachers may wonder if their students can attain satisfactory learning performance in an online learning environment without teachers' on-the-spot attention. In order to develop students' skills in programming, promote their enjoyment of learning and intention to learn to program, the researchers integrated two innovative teaching approaches, using online peer-facilitated learning and distributed pair programming, and investigated the effects of these on students' online learning performance. This study conducted an experiment that included 128 undergraduates from four class sections of Department of Finance. Thus, the experimental design in this research was a 2 (Peer-facilitated learning vs. non-peer-facilitated learning) × 2 (Distributed pair programming vs. non-distributed pair programming) factorial pretest/post-test design. The participants in this research mainly consisted of four classes of students from a non-computer or information department who took a compulsory course on programming design.’ Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in this study. According to the results, the peer-facilitated learning group exhibited significantly better development of programming skills, enjoyment of learning, and intention to learn, than the non-peer-facilitated learning group. However, expected effects of enhancing the learning of the students in this study who received the distributed pair programming were not found. The design of online pedagogy can be a reference for online educators. The implications of applying online peer-facilitated learning and distributed pair programming to support students’ learning and the design of online programming courses are discussed.}

Three themes emerged pertaining how students’ understandings of the design tasks’ participation framework and greater applications impacted their epistemic agency. Findings suggest the importance of making explicit to students the rationales behind new student expectations to prevent “pseudo-student epistemic agency,” and shed light on the significance of fostering equitable classroom communities where all members are viewed as valuable and capable sensemakers.}

The accumulation of publicly available gene expression data for hundreds of plant species, together with advances in bioinformatical methods and affordable computing, sets ingenuity as one of the major bottlenecks in understanding gene function and regulation. Here, we show how a credit card-sized computer retailing for <50 USD can be used to rapidly predict gene function and infer regulatory networks from RNA sequencing data. To achieve this, we constructed a bioinformatical pipeline that downloads and allows quality-control of RNA sequencing data; and generates a gene co-expression network that can reveal enzymes and transcription factors participating and controlling a given biosynthetic pathway. We exemplify this by first identifying genes and transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of secondary cell wall in the plant Artemisia annua, the main natural source of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Networks were then used to dissect the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway, which suggest potential transcription factors regulating artemisinin biosynthesis. We provide the source code of our pipeline (https://github.com/mutwil/LSTrAP-Lite) and envision that the ubiquity of affordable computing, availability of biological data and increased bioinformatical training of biologists will transform the field of bioinformatics.

Research experiences can lead to gains in students’ general skills, such as oral visual and written communication, as well as more specific research-associated skills. Traditionally, undergraduates have been introduced to research primarily through the apprentice model, in which undergraduates join a research group and receive one-on-one guidance from a mentor. This model, while effective, limits the number of students who can engage in research experiences and tends to be more accessible to students who are familiar with the research enterprise. There is therefore an increasing emphasis on developing opportunities for students to engage in research in credit-bearing courses, extending the benefits of research experiences to a larger and more diverse group. These course-based research experiences can provide many of the same benefits students derive from traditional undergraduate research experiences, such as increased content knowledge and analytical skills and persistence in science. This chapter describes important characteristics of course-based research experiences and provides examples that range from national programs to single courses developed by individual instructors. We end the chapter by offering practical suggestions to help instructors design an effective course-based research experience.}

abstract = {Generative AI, and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), have gained substantial momentum due to their wide applications in various disciplines. While the use of these game changing technologies in generating textual information has already been demonstrated in several application domains, their abilities in generating complex models and executable codes need to be explored. As an intriguing case is the goodness of the machine and deep learning models generated by these LLMs in conducting automated scientific data analysis, where a data analyst may not have enough expertise in manually coding and optimizing complex deep learning models and codes and thus may opt to leverage LLMs to generate the required models. This paper investigates and compares the performance of the mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, PaLM, LLama, and Falcon, in generating deep learning models for analyzing time series data, an important and popular data type with its prevalent applications in many application domains including financial and stock market. This research conducts a set of controlled experiments where the prompts for generating deep learning-based models are controlled with respect to sensitivity levels of four criteria including (1) Clarify and Specificity, (2) Objective and Intent, (3) Contextual Information, and (4) Format and Style. While the results are relatively mix, we observe some distinct patterns. We notice that using LLMs, we are able to generate deep learning-based models with executable codes for each dataset separately whose performance are comparable with the manually crafted and optimized LSTM models for predicting the whole time series dataset. We also noticed that ChatGPT outperforms the other LLMs in generating more accurate models. Furthermore, we observed that the goodness of the generated models vary with respect to the “temperature” parameter used in configuring LLMS. The results can be beneficial for data analysts and practitioners who would like to leverage generative AIs to produce good prediction models with acceptable goodness.}

Playful Learning Landscapes increase the accessibility of early STEM learning in everyday public spaces (e.g., bus stops, grocery stores) by merging principles of guided play and STEM learning goals with local community's values. We used community-based design research to (1) identify Latine families’ funds of knowledge related to play, science, and math learning, and (2) create designs for playful environments merging families’ values and practices with guided play and STEM learning principles. Our design partners were 32 parents, primarily Spanish-speaking immigrant mothers from Mexico, and two directors of a local community organization. The design process consisted of co-design sessions, interviews, inductive thematic analysis, elaboration, playtest and feedback, and iteration. Our findings showed that familismo, heritage representation, and the meaning of community spaces influenced the ways families engaged in STEM learning and the learning environments they desired in their community. Moreover, families’ STEM practices were rooted in everyday experiences of playing cultural games, family food routines, and outdoor activities. Incorporating Latine parents in the design process and leveraging their funds of knowledge resulted in culturally situated designs aligned with playful and STEM learning principles. This study contributes to knowledge of Latine families’ values and practices that can help create home-community connections to strengthen children's learning.}

The primary objective was to identify promising practices for online professional learning (PL) focused on math and coding using a maker-pedagogies approach to teaching and learning, based on the teachers’ learning experiences. Study participants included 20 teachers from a rural school board in Northern Ontario, Canada. Findings indicated that the following may be considered as promising practices when developing and implementing virtual math and coding PL from a maker perspective. It is important to: a) balance sessions focused on specific math and coding content with more general sessions focused on learning the various maker-technology tools; b) include both synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities for the variety of teachers involved in the learning; c) include collaborative learning in the teacher PL and a virtual platform that can support this type of social learning; d) ensure the PL sessions are on-going as opposed to one-off or isolated sessions. This research suggests that online professional learning sessions need to consider three elements: the teacher, the content, and the learning environment and offers important recommendations for future work in this area.}

It has become a serious problem around the world. We present a new system, FaNDS, that detects fake news efficiently. The system is based on several concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. There are two main concepts: an Inconsistency Graph and Energy Flow. The Inconsistency Graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions between them for edges. Energy Flow assigns each node an initial energy and then some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on all nodes converges. To illustrate FaNDS we use the original data from the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1). First, the data has to be reconstructed in order to generate the Inconsistency Graph. The graph contains various subgraphs with well-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the news items. Then the Energy Flow method is applied. The nodes with high energy are the candidates for being fake news. In our experiments, all these were indeed fake news as we checked each using several reliable web sites. We compared FaNDS to several other fake news detection methods and found it to be more sensitive in discovering fake news items.}

abstract = {Data processing and learning has become a spearhead for the advancement of medicine, with pathology and laboratory medicine has no exception. The incorporation of scientific research through clinical informatics, including genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, into clinical practice unlocks innovative approaches for patient care. Computational pathology is burgeoning subspecialty in pathology that promises a better-integrated solution to whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics. However, computational pathology faces several challenges, including the ability to integrate raw data from different sources, limitation of hardware processing capacity, and a lack of specific training programs, as well as issues on ethics and larger societal acceptable practices that are still solidifying. The establishment of the entire industry of computational pathology requires far-reaching changes of the three essential elements connecting patients and doctors: the local laboratory, the scan center, and the central cloud hub/portal for data processing and retrieval. Computational pathology, unlocked through information integration and advanced digital communication networks, has the potential to improve clinical workflow efficiency, diagnostic quality, and ultimately create personalized diagnosis and treatment plans for patients. This review describes clinical perspectives and discusses the statistical methods, clinical applications, potential obstacles, and future directions of computational pathology.}

In these studies, graphing technologies include computer software such as simulations; online tools such as graph utilities; and sensors such as temperature probes. We characterize the assessments used to measure graphing. We describe the investigative activities that graphing supports including generating hypotheses or predictions, collecting data, analyzing or interpreting data, and reflecting. Studies show that graphing technologies impact learning of mathematics and science topics as well as graphing itself. These technologies are especially advantageous for learning complex topics where students need to conduct investigations to interpret change over time or position such as functions, kinematics, and thermodynamics. Recent studies take advantage of logs of student interactions to study the design of automated guidance for graphing. We discuss the implications of these findings for instruction at the K-12 level.}

abstract = {Background
A needs-based approach is desirable for the transformation of pharmaceutical education, and to link pharmaceutical education with the health needs of populations and national priorities. There are varying levels of data in the literature on the status of pharmaceutical education in all six World Health Organization (WHO) regions, especially in the context of needs identification and evidence-based policy interventions. The framework for this study was the FIP Development Goals.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to develop evidence-based policies through a needs-based approach for pharmaceutical education transformation nationally, regionally and globally by addressing the following objectives: 1. Identify global and regional needs in pharmaceutical education, through a regional SWOT analysis and prioritization of FIP development goals; 2. Develop valid and credible regional roadmaps for pharmaceutical education advancement according to the identified prioritized goals and 3. Develop a global call to action as a policy intervention for advancing pharmaceutical education.
Methods
This study was conducted between 2020 and 2021 using a mixed methods approach. Surveys of higher education institutions and a series of qualitative interviews were conducted with national professional leadership organizations, with further regional workshops having 284 participants recruited from the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) membership base, spanning all six WHO regions.
Results
Eleven out of 21 FIP DGs were identified as priorities for regional roadmaps and FIP DG 1 (Academic capacity) was identified as a priority in four regions. All regions had distinctive results with an area of commonality between them. There were common weaknesses in the adoption of competency-based education and inter-professional education.
Conclusions
It is critical for every country and region to develop needs- and evidence-based policies for the transformation of pharmaceutical education, for which FIP DGs provide a systematic framework.}

abstract = {An engaging first programming class (CS1) often inspires students’ passion for computer science (CS). However, the evidence in the literature suggests that the average CS1 classes are anything but engaging for many students. The performance of CS compared to other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses in international student engagement surveys seems to substantiate CS1 failure, attrition rates, and lack of diversity in most CS classes. Meanwhile, for its simplicity in introducing programming to beginners, primary and secondary schools use Scratch, an educational programming environment developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. For the same reason, higher institutions now include some forms of Scratch instruction in CS1. The question remains, to what extent is Scratch engaging, especially for students in higher education? This study addressed this gap by observing college computer science students exposed to a constructionist Scratch programming pedagogy. We adopted a descriptive design based on quantitative observations. To observe the class during a weekly 2-hour session, we employed five CS educators, one observer per week. Each observer, employing a 20-item observation protocol, rated the extent of affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement of first-year CS students in a polytechnic in North Central Nigeria. Most of the students were learning to program for the first time. Analysis of the data showed a significant agreement in the ratings of the five observers for overall student engagement, although the impact was moderate. However, while agreement in their ratings for affective engagement was significant, with a large effect, there was no significant concordance in their ratings for behavioral engagement. Observers also significantly agreed in their ratings for cognitive engagement; however, the impact was moderate. These findings suggest that employing Scratch in higher education can be engaging and useful, especially for students with no prior programming experience.}

Drawing on the TPD@Scale model, we systematically analyzed the quality, equity, and efficiency dimensions of 37 technology-enabled TPD programs implemented during the pandemic. The findings demonstrate that technology-enabled TPD programs could develop teachers’ knowledge and skills critical to quality teaching during the pandemic and create environments that foster active learning and collaboration among teachers. However, there needs to be significant improvements in using technology to provide expert support and facilitate feedback and reflections. Furthermore, equity and efficiency were not specifically discussed in these TPD programs.

To address these concepts, a number of themes are discussed, namely the data integration at different levels, the relationship of Metabolomics with the Systems Biology Public Health Science, the relevance and role of longitudinal and lifelong studies, the role of the quantitative methods, the connection with Big Data in Public Health with the possible evolution towards a “precision public health” and, finally, the process of knowledge integration in the fields of policies, training and resources, with the final goal of a strong translation of Metabolomic tools from research to practice.}

Education around these tools is often set in group contexts and collaboration is typically considered an important part of the learning process. However, much of the software tools currently available are still designed around a laptop programming paradigm that tends to restrict collaboration rather than encourage shifting of roles and sharing of experiences. This paper explores how to design tools that invite collaborative interactions, in particular how mobile software tools, with heavy usage of video as an interactive resource, could allow for collaborative sketching and understanding. Based on contextual inquiries with educators, observations and engagements with students in classroom settings, and a workshop with Arduino Education, this paper sketches out a vision for how the software tools used for learning physical computing can be re-designed to better work within the context of group work from the observations, for groups of students aged 14–16-years old.}

Works of renowned authors, as well as some of their main commentators, were addressed to report the development of enactive approach. We indicate that the enactive approach transcends its original context within biology, and at a second moment within connectionism, changes the understanding of the relationships so far established between the body and the environment, and the ideas of conceptual relationships between the mind and the body. The influence on computational theories is of great importance, leading to new artificial intelligence systems as well as the proposition of complex, autopoietic and alive machines. Finally, the article stresses the importance of the enactive approach in the design of agents, understanding that previous approaches have very different cognitive architectures and that a prototypical model of enactive cognitive architecture is one of the largest challenges today.}

Our findings suggest that teachers valued the MCVT toolkit as a resource for their own learning and perceived the cards to be useful for supporting new computational practices, specifically for learning through making and connecting to examples of everyday computing. Critically reviewed by teachers during codesign workshops, the toolkit however posed some implementation challenges and constraints for learning through making and troubleshooting circuitry. From teacher surveys, interviews, workshop video recordings, and teacher-constructed projects, we show how teachers codesigned new design prototypes and pedagogical activities while also adapting and extending paper-based computing materials so their students could take advantage of the unique technical and expressive affordances of MCVT Cards.

Furthermore, we also found that providing detailed explanations after both easy and difficult game tasks led to a decrease in learners' engagement. The implications of findings and future research directions are discussed.}

abstract = {Game-based learning (GBL) has garnered significant attention as a means to enhance student science learning. However, researchers often broadly categorize GBL without specific attention to teachers' practices or the different game-based pedagogies (GBPs) such as serious game-based learning and learning by making games. Serious game-based learning involves the use of games designed primarily for purposes beyond entertainment, engaging students in learning activities. Learning by making games goes further by enabling students to construct and expand their knowledge through creative activities. Furthermore, the impact of students' weekly gaming hours on their academic performance under different GBPs has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we analyzed pre- and post-science unit assessment data to investigate the effects of serious game-based learning and learning by making games, along with gaming hours, on the science learning outcomes of 129 sixth-grade students in a Midwestern urban school district in the United States. Employing Bayesian paired t-tests and ANOVA, we examined the effects of two GBPs (serious game learning and game-making) implemented by two science teachers and the interaction between each GBP and students' weekly gaming hours. Our findings indicate that both GBPs led to improvements in students’ learning, with those participating in making games showing an average increase of 3.5 points more on the posttests than those engaged in serious game-based learning. Additionally, data on student-reported weekly gaming hours showed that in both GBP conditions, students with medium gaming hours showed the most improvement compared to those with fewer or more gaming hours. There was also a potential interaction between types of GBP and the effect of gaming hours outcomes in that the learning gain difference between the two GBPs was more pronounced among students reporting fewer gaming hours, although this effect was not significant. This study contributes to the GBL field by providing practical design recommendations for integrating GBL into formal Kindergarten to 12th grade (K-12) settings, taking into account teachers' pedagogical agency and students' gaming experiences.}

As part of the national heritage, there is an increasing research interest in Hutong neighbourhoods, many of which are facing oblivion. This study presents a formal grammar for Hutong neighbourhood generation. This research investigates traditional principles of urban planning of ancient Beijing, based on examples on the historical map Qianlong Jingcheng Quantu, to derive the lost design rules. These rules are used to build up a procedural modelling framework, which reveals the development of Beijing's urban structure from the Yuan (1271–1368) to the Qing (1644–1911) dynasty. Our findings present a grammar incorporated into the procedural modelling framework to parametrically generate Hutong neighbourhoods, which replicates the morphological characteristics of historic cases. It contributes to the understanding of the generation of Hutong neighbourhoods. In support of heritage sustainability, this grammar can be implemented in a computational environment by visual scripting that enables the generation of new instances of Hutong neighbourhoods, both real and virtual.}

This paper specifically looks at the performance of social robots in place of university professors, in the field of engineering, measuring three outcomes, enjoyment (questionnaire), the acquisition of knowledge (academic test after class and final exam grades) and level of surprise (facial expressions monitored by cameras). Inspired by previous cognitive studies which have evidenced that feelings of surprise and familiarity affect the learning process, the hypothesis of this research is that robot-tutors will increase student's enjoyment. Leading the research to question whether higher levels of enjoyment strongly correlate with a higher acquisition of knowledge through a series of three experiments. Using the same subject material, three variables were tested: 1. one robot-tutor lecture, 2. one human-tutor lecture, 3. two robot-tutor lectures. Initial findings showed that students lectured by a human-tutor once, acquired a higher level of knowledge compared to those lectured by a robot-tutor once. However, those in the robot-tutor lecture shared higher levels of enjoyment as well as increased expressions of surprise. When students were lectured by a robot-tutor for the second time, results showed both a higher level of acquired knowledge and enjoyment and a drop in expressed surprise, compared to both, one human-tutor lecture and one robot-tutor lecture or one robot-tutor lecture. We conclude that high levels of surprise distracted students initially but once overcome, acted as motivation to study.}

abstract = {There are some dichotomies surrounding ChatGPT's application and impact on education as a central part of artificial intelligence (AI) integration. Problems concerning negative preconceptions and the limited usage of this form of AI have been reported, as some teachers perceive it as a competitor. This is due to insufficient readiness for its integration and a lack of understanding of how it can facilitate teaching innovation. Due to this, the researchers applied a bisymmetric approach, where necessity conditional analysis (NCA) as a symmetrical approach employs necessity logic to identify the must-have factors required for language teachers' passing accountability, while PLS-SEM as an asymmetrical approach follows additive sufficiency logic to identify the should-have factors that contribute to helping them to pass their accountability. Applying this approach would generate more results from different perspectives in ChatGPT readiness and language teaching innovation with it. In this line, the researchers randomly explored 124 Iranian in-service language teachers ChatGPT readiness and their teaching innovation in helping them pass the external and internal language teaching competencies. The result of the PLS-SEM showed that the more the language teachers were ready to practically use ChatGPT alongside, aware of its opportunities and challenges in English language teaching (ELT), the more they could generate more language teaching methods and approaches with it, apply them to their language teaching procedures, and share them with their colleagues. Moreover, their generational language teaching methods with ChatGPT mediated the correlation between ChatGPT readiness and meeting internal accountability. Additionally, the NCA showed that the generation of language teaching methods with ChatGPT and their implementation through it were among the necessary factors that help language teachers meet both internal and external accountability by teaching language with ChatGPT. Based on these findings, the researchers recommended that stakeholders shift their focus from AI programming to AI teaching, especially for ELT.}

abstract = {Diabetes is one of the deadliest and costliest diseases. Today, automatic diabetes detection systems are primarily developed using deep learning (DL) approaches, which give high accuracy in classifying patients into two classes: have diabetes or not. Unfortunately, DL is a high-complexity and unexplainable black-box model. This paper proposes a new nearest neighbor-based framework to tackle those issues in classifying two diabetes datasets: binary-class Pima India Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) and multiclass Diabetes Type. A k-means clustering (KMC) is first carried out to remove the noises or outliers and keep the competent data in the training set. The dimension of the competent data is then reduced using an autoencoder (AE) to minimize the distances of the intra-class data but maximize that of the inter-class. A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and two variants: pseudo nearest neighbor rule (PNNR) and local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN), are used to detect diabetes. In addition, a new variant named multi-voter multi-commission nearest neighbor (MVMCNN) is introduced. An investigation based on 5-fold cross-validation (FCV) informs that, for binary-class PIDD, the proposed combination of KMC, AE, and MVMCNN achieves the highest accuracy of 99.13%, which is slightly higher than the state-of-the-art DL-based detection model that produces 98.07%. An evaluation based on 10-FCV also indicates that, for the multiclass Diabetes Type, it obtains a higher accuracy of 95.24% than the DL-based model for predicting diabetes that gives 94.02%.}

abstract = {Developing interdisciplinary undergraduate courses is challenging at all levels; it requires involving trained faculty who can successfully cover more than one discipline and creating a new curriculum that crosses discipline boundaries. While such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. However, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. As part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called Biophysical Modeling of Excitable Cells (BMEC). The course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. It focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy, and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. This course also provides pedagogical experience for senior Ph.D. students in Neuroscience. BMEC is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates’ ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. The class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biology/psychology and physics/mathematics oriented. The teamwork allows students with more substantial biology/psychology backgrounds to explain to physics/mathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. Simultaneously, students with substantial physics/mathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes. This study expands on Oprisan (2021) by including examples of hands-on activities, student projects, and a brief overview of course assessment tools and results. This study also includes more recent approaches to teaching computational neuroscience using cloud computing.}

The increased integration of making into K-12 curricula has enormous implications not only for instructional design but also for assessment practices. Maker-oriented activities have the potential to shed light on types of learning that previous assessment systems have not captured and examined. Nevertheless, little is discussed on how making can contribute to the assessment and instructional practices at large. This case study investigated educators' experiences with assessment in classrooms integrating maker activities. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with six K-12 educators in Canada, the researchers examined: (1) in what ways does making activities create opportunities for assessment and instruction in K-12 classrooms? (2) in what ways does maker learning become a challenge for assessment and instruction in K-12 classrooms? Our analysis revealed several ways in which teachers experienced the advantages of the making approach for understanding student learning and for helping students become further aware of their own progress. The results also revealed challenges to conducting assessments for maker learning, including administrative challenges like continuing to gain support from the administration, and literacy challenges such as students’ obsession with letter grades. This study provides insights into how making may help improve assessment and instructional practices in K-12 classrooms.}

Such an approach is especially advantageous to adult-learners in higher education as it meets their educational needs. However, adult-learners’ participation in blended learning programmes remains challenging due to a general lack of online interaction, and no clear teaching strategies that address this concern. Literature relating to adult-learners’ educational needs and online interaction was consulted in order to design teaching strategies that foster adult-learners’ online interaction. The aim of this study is to further validate these teaching strategies, hence a multiple case study was carried out using a mixed method approach. As such, eight teachers and sixteen students from four courses across three universities in Belgium and the Netherlands were interviewed. Additionally, a questionnaire testing a pre-defined set of variables was distributed to 84 students. The results lead to a set of validated teaching strategies that help teachers to further develop their professional skills and expertise. The teaching strategies can be grouped into three categories, namely 1) the teacher's online presence, 2) collaborative learning activities and preparatory learning activities, and 3) the distribution of learning content and learning activities across online and in-class learning. An elaborate set of validated teaching strategies is included. This study aids towards teacher professional development and adds evidence-based knowledge to teaching strategies and instructional frameworks for adult-learners in higher education.

This study explores the impacts of Connect Science, a service-learning (SL) program developed to enhance elementary students' energy literacy in the United States. Program impacts were explored within the context of a randomized controlled trial. Teachers in the SL intervention group were provided with professional development, coaching and curricular materials. Each fourth grade class chose an energy problem to address, and designed projects to test out a solution. Teachers in a waitlist control group taught their typical energy unit. Upon completion of the unit, students were asked to write about a problem related to energy production or use and propose a potential solution. Inductive content analysis was used to code 703 student responses (377 from control group and 326 from SL group). The majority of students expressed concerns about wasting or using too much electricity or the use of nonrenewable energy sources. Solutions focused on energy conservation and the use of renewable or clean resources were mentioned most frequently overall. Students in the SL group were significantly more likely to mention environmental impacts of various energy sources and to suggest energy conservation solutions or educating others. Conversely, the control group student responses more often focused on electric circuits or electrical safety. Results from this study suggest the promise of environmental SL programs to advance energy literacy and promote critical thinking about how to address energy problems.}

It compares traditional methods, represented by naive Bayes, to popular continuation pre-processing techniques such as domain adaptive learning and task adaptive learning to improve the effectiveness of transfer learning. Finally, this study builds targeted models based on real application needs and selects professional rules consistent with the scene application.

abstract = {Slight distortions can cause dramatic changes in the properties of crystalline perovskite materials and their derivatives. Due to the numerous types of distortions and unclarified distortion-structure relations, a quantitative distortion manipulation for the desired crystalline phase of perovskite materials suitable for various application remains challenging. Here, by establishing parameter sets to systematically describe the types, magnitudes and positional relations involved in distortions, we are able to interpret the structural regulations and manipulation strategies in 7 reported crystal systems. Through the construction of distortion-phase-property functional curves, we further propose a paradigm to quantify the structural distortion manipulation for desired perovskite phases. Using the example of perovskite-like tungsten oxides, we successfully quantify their volume shrinkage and symmetry increase during lithiation. This work verifies that the complicated research and development of perovskite materials can be simplified into a mathematical problem solving process, which will inspire researchers with different backgrounds to participate, especially mathematicians and computer scientists.}

abstract = {Summary
The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) co-circulated globally during 2020 and 2021, fueling waves of infections. They were displaced by Delta during a third wave worldwide in 2021, which, in turn, was displaced by Omicron in late 2021. In this study, we use phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods to reconstruct the dispersal patterns of VOCs worldwide. We find that source-sink dynamics varied substantially by VOC and identify countries that acted as global and regional hubs of dissemination. We demonstrate the declining role of presumed origin countries of VOCs in their global dispersal, estimating that India contributed <15% of Delta exports and South Africa <1%–2% of Omicron dispersal. We estimate that >80 countries had received introductions of Omicron within 100 days of its emergence, associated with accelerated passenger air travel and higher transmissibility. Our study highlights the rapid dispersal of highly transmissible variants, with implications for genomic surveillance along the hierarchical airline network.}

abstract = {Climate change calls for action from all sectors of our global economy, including ICT. Therefore, it is important to change the way we develop software to address the challenges posed by sustainability. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability requirements catalogue that helps developers be aware of sustainability-related properties worth considering during software development. The information for this catalogue was gathered via a systematic mapping study, whose results were synthesised in feature models and then modelled using iStar for a more expressive and configurable representation. A qualitative evaluation of the catalogue’s readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain, showed that around 79% of the respondents found the catalogue “Good” or “Very Good”. However, more than 5% of the expert participants found weaknesses regarding most of the evaluated questions and around 25% are neutral in their overall evaluation. This led us to evolve the initial version of the catalogue for the social and technical dimensions of sustainability to improve its completeness and usefulness. This is achieved by aligning the information gathered in the systematic mapping study with the well-established quality model of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011, as we expect most of the experts are familiar with those qualities and respective hierarchies. During this process, we found information that led us to propose two additional qualities that were not covered by the ISO standard: fairness and legislation. We applied this evolved version of the catalogue to the U-Bike project comparing the requirements elicited without the catalogue with those identified using the catalogue. The result suggests that new sustainability requirements were worth considering from a sustainability point of view, supporting the usefulness of the catalogue.}

We propose a solution to the challenges of obtaining relevant eye-tracking information in a dynamic 3D virtual environment and calculating interpretable indicators of learning and social behavior. With a method called "gaze-ray casting," we simulated 3D-gaze movements to obtain information about the gazed objects. This information was used to create graphical models of visual attention, establishing attention networks. These networks represented participants' gaze transitions between different entities in the VR environment over time. Measures of centrality, distribution, and interconnectedness of the networks were calculated to describe the network structure. The measures, derived from graph theory, allowed for statistical inference testing and the interpretation of participants' visual attention in 3D VR environments. Our method provides useful insights when analyzing students’ learning in a VR classroom, as reported in a corresponding evaluation article with N = 274 participants. •Guidelines on implementing gaze-ray casting in VR using the Unreal Engine and the HTC VIVE Pro Eye.•Creating gaze-based attention networks and analyzing their network structure.•Implementation tutorials and the Open Source software code are provided via OSF: https://osf.io/pxjrc/?view_only=1b6da45eb93e4f9eb7a138697b941198.}

One promising avenue for students’ successful counting is for them to think judiciously about how they encode outcomes – that is, how they symbolize and represent the outcomes they are trying to count. We provide a detailed case study of two students as they encoded outcomes in their work on several related counting problems within a computational setting. We highlight the role that a computational environment may have played in this encoding activity. We illustrate ways in which by-hand work and computer programming worked together to facilitate the students’ successful encoding activity. This case demonstrates ways in which the activity of computation seemed to interact with by-hand work to facilitate sophisticated encoding of outcomes.}

Digital Education has been approached from an instrumental point of view, focusing on the advantages that the introduction at an early stage of digital tools brings to the teaching and learning processes to ensure children can acquire the required 21st competencies of a future workforce. In the application for the Indian case, social, cultural, economic and educational data obtained through desk research during the first semester of 2021 has been taken into consideration. Despite significant Government efforts on scaling up Digital Education, primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic school closure, the 0.596 DEIFDC score on a 0–1 possible range has shown Inadequate Digital Education Deployment, derived mainly from poor school infrastructure, limited pedagogical capabilities and modest students' skills. Furthermore, the socio-demographic differences observed among school children and the existent digital divide in rural and urban areas demonstrate that major effort needs to be undertaken to ensure vulnerable Indian population does not lag behind under the new rules of the Digital Economy.}

abstract = {Background
COVID-19 prompted a global shift to online learning, including video conference-assisted online learning (VCAOL), which necessitated educators understanding students' perspectives.
Objective
This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) model-agnostic interpretability that could predict students' academic performance in VCAOL.
Material and methods
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and data augmentation were used to handle imbalanced data from small-scale datasets. The prediction model was developed using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). SHAP model-agnostic interpretability was used to interpret and comprehend prediction findings. The data was gathered from September 2022 to January 2023, resulting in 361 records. The research variables included students' academic performance as the dependent variable, and the video conference application (VC), learning material (LM), internet connection (IC), students' ability to learn (SL), and student knowledge (SK) as independent variables, which were mapped into 28 attributes.
Result
The SMOTE improved the performance of three algorithms, with RF outperforming SVM and GNB in almost all tests, achieving an accuracy of 79.45%, precision of 75.71%, and recall of 79.45%. SHAP bar plots ranked attributes by importance demonstrated that “Performance,” “Frequency Constraint,” and “Increase Value” had a significant impact on prediction results. When we mapped the three attributes to our study perspective, we determined that SK and SL were the most important views for students to perform well in VCAOL. SHAP's beeswarm revealed students' performance in VCAOL was positively correlated with “Performance”, “Increase Value”, “Completing Project”, “Adequate Method”, “User Interface”, and “Feature”. As we mapped the three attributes to our study perspective, we found that SK, LM, SL, and VC were positively related to students' performance in VCAOL.
Conclusion
The study highlighted the potential of ML in developing data-driven decision-making tools for predicting students' academic performance and identifying critical attributes in a prediction model.}

abstract = {Thanks to the ubiquity of multicore processors, today’s CS students must be introduced to parallel computing or they will be ill prepared as modern software developers. Professional developers of parallel software think in terms of parallel design patterns, which are markedly different from traditional (sequential) design patterns. It follows that the more we can teach students to think in terms of parallel patterns, the more their thinking will resemble that of parallel software professionals. In this paper, we present patternlets—minimalist, scalable, syntactically correct programs, each designed to introduce students to a particular parallel design pattern. The collection currently includes 44 patternlets (16 MPI, 17 OpenMP, 9 Pthreads, and 2 heterogeneous), of which we present a representative sample. We also present data that indicate the use of patternlets to introduce parallelism in CS2 produced a modest improvement in student understanding of parallel concepts.}

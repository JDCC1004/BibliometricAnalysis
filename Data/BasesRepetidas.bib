abstract = {Computational, logic thinking and problem-solving skills are extremely important for students' success in the future. This poster describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote K-8 Computer Science Education among in-service and pre-service teachers. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to facilitate participants' learning about and application of foundational principles of computer science and computational thinking into K-8 STEM curriculum and teaching. Participants explored hard/software platforms and used open source sites such as Scratch, Code.org and Code Academy. Participants envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms and worked in pairs or groups to design a problem-based project for students. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge.},

This means that 100 000 teachers need to learn programming and digital competence in less than a year. In this paper we report on our experience working with professional teacher training in Sweden's fifth largest city. The city has about 150 000 inhabitants and about 50 schools with about 14 000 students in primary education. The project has been carried out in close cooperation with the municipality.},

abstract = {Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education.}

abstract = {In this workshop, participants will learn about how to integrate computational thinking and creative thinking activities that have been shown to significantly improve student learning and performance in their classes via rigorous research investigations. In particular, participants will be familiarized with the suite of Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) (which are non-programming-based, group-based, active learning exercises), practice hands-on how to complete such an CCE, learn about how to integrate and adapt them into their courses, and be exposed to the educational research studies behind the development, design, and administration of these CCEs. Participants will also learn how to conduct evidence-based educational research studies. Workshop sessions will include presentations, panel-based Q&amp;A, an experience report, breakout group discussions, and hands-on activities. A suite of resources including the survey instruments, CCEs, implementation strategies, and research findings will be shared post-workshop.

abstract = {Each year, we graduate a fair number of students with college degrees in computing-related disciplines. Each year, we lose a fair number of students out of the discipline. We spend a good deal of time focusing on what is causing students to leave or fail. We do not spend a lot of time focusing on the learning journey and supporting students throughout their transformative experiences. Threshold concepts are those concepts or learning experiences which define the overall disciplinary learning journey, enabling the learner to see from a new perspective, participate in discourse previously unavailable to them, and engage with the world from a transformed frame of understanding. They are often those concepts difficult for students to understand within a discipline such as "personhood' in Philosophy, 'gravity' in Physics, or 'limit' in Mathematics. As a result of this transformation and the resultant traversal of a liminal state, elements of an identity developed. In this poster, we present our current work identifying potential threshold concepts experienced by intermediate computer science students and consider the impact of these concepts on their development of an identity within computer science.},

abstract = {To successfully bring introductory computing to non-CS majors, one needs to create a curriculum that will appeal to students from diverse disciplines. Several educational theories emphasize the need for introductory contexts that align with students' long-term goals and are perceived as useful. Data Science, using algorithms to manipulate real-world data and interpreting the results, has emerged as a field with cross-disciplinary value, and has strong potential as an appealing context for introductory computing courses. However, it is not easy to find, clean, and integrate datasets that will satisfy a broad variety of learners. The CORGIS project (https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis) enables instructors to easily incorporate data science into their classroom. Specifically, it provides over 40 datasets in areas including history, politics, medicine, and education. Additionally, the CORGIS infrastructure supports the integration of new datasets with simple libraries for Java, Python, and Racket, thus empowering introductory students to write programs that manipulate real data. Finally, the CORGIS web-based tools allow learners to visualize and explore datasets without programming, enabling data science lessons on day one. We have incorporated CORGIS assignments into an introductory course for non-majors to study their impact on learners' motivation, with positive initial results. These results indicate that external adopters are likely to find the CORGIS tools and materials useful in their own pedagogical pursuits.},

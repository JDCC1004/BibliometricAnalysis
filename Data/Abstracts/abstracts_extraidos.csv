9694003,The impact of different types of scaffolding in project-based learning on girls' computational thinking skills and self-efficacy,"Gender differences in computational thinking (CT) among students are obvious, with boys ‘CT being significantly higher than girls’. Therefore, how to effectively improve girls' CT has become a serious concern. This study integrated two types of project-based learning (PBL) into a Scratch programming course, one with extensive teacher-supported scaffolding and the other with limited teacher-supported scaffolding. To examine their impact on girls' CT skills and self-efficacy, this study applied mixed research methods, conducted a pretest-posttest control group experiment, and analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data collected from 21 grade-3 girls in a primary school. It was found that the extensive teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL in a Scratch programming course is more effective in promoting the CT skills and self-efficacy than limited teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL. These findings have some implications for the effective PBL practice and related teacher professional development."
10260990,An Educational Game to Promote the Development of Computational Thinking in Children Both Neurotypical and with Intellectual Disabilities,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a way to structure thinking to solve problems, which develops cognitive skills. Educational Digital Games (EDG) are a potential tool to work with CT, stimulating the student's interest and learning. Still, to make these games playable by children with Intellectual disabilities (ID), it is necessary to have adaptations suitable to their educational needs.

The guide was created on a foundation of cultural relevance and cogenerative dialogues. Here we describe salient points about the creation of the guide and insights gained during these workshops."
10496944,Construction and Application of a Computational Thinking Assessment Framework from the Perspective of the Iceberg Model,"Computational thinking assessment is an important part of testing the effectiveness of computational thinking cultivation. However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results. Since the iceberg model can comprehensively and deeply explore individual characteristics, this paper draws on the division idea of the model and divides computational thinking into explicit computational thinking the basic knowledge required to solve problems using computational thinking and implicit computational thinking the internal psychological characteristics of individuals in the process of using computational thinking. A comprehensive assessment framework of computational thinking is constructed, which contains five dimensions: knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, internet attitude, learning motivation, and thinking style. Finally, its application in the hierarchical teaching of computational thinking and suggestions for personalized teaching programs are given in order to promote the development of personalized education in computational thinking."

10892901,What Concepts of Computational Thinking are Being Effectively Used in K12 Education: A Systematic Mapping,"This research article assesses the concepts of Computational Thinking (CT) as applied in basic education. Although widely used in K12 education, many articles indicate a lack of uniformity in the conceptualization of CT. CT is defined as the systematic problem-solving ability based on algorithmic processes. It is seen as crucial for stimulating interest and diversity in STEM careers. Effective CT teaching requires precise conceptualization and appropriate teaching techniques. With the world's increasing digitization, CT is considered as fundamental as reading or math skills and should be taught from K12 education. This article reports a systematic mapping of CT con-cepts applied in K12 activities, reflecting on the chosen activities and teaching techniques. Despite some articles highlighting the unclear definition of CT, there is a notable agreement on its key concepts. The study used the IEEEXplore database, analyzing primary articles from 2019–2023. The findings reveal a high degree of similarity in CT concepts, indicating a trend towards standardization. A catalog of frequently cited activities used to teach CT is presented, aiding teachers in introducing CT in their classes. This study supports the development of teaching policies and initiatives. contributing to STEM interest and diversity."

10892914,Integrating Computational Thinking Into the Curricula to Bridge the Skill Gap in Engineering Education,"This work-in-progress research-to-practice paper presents an intervention on integrating computational thinking modules into a software engineering course. The national consensus on the significance of computational thinking has prompted the expansion of related educational initiatives over the past decade. Since the definition of computational thinking by Wing in 2006, this concept has gained significant attention within the educational community. Particularly this surge of interest has led to extensive research into its conceptual foundations and subsequent integration into educational curricula since 2013. National initiatives have since emerged to incorporate computational thinking into the educational system. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence and computing systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing demand from industries for a workforce and graduates adept at critical thinking and problem-solving. Aligned with this national movement, our study presents a two-year institutional initiative, aimed at integrating computational thinking into the software engineering program. The software engineering discipline extensively involves design thinking and problem-solving skills. However, we noticed that these higher-level skills are not imparted early in the program to teach students this method of thinking and approaching problems. To bridge this skill gap, we developed a set of computational thinking modules and integrated them into a gateway course in the software engineering program. Over two years, we implemented this intervention in an introductory-level course and evaluated its impact on students' computational thinking skills by analyzing their responses to a standard Computational Thinking Assessment survey. The results showed significant improvement in most components. These early findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating these computational thinking modules into the gateway courses, regardless of the specific course topic. A notable feature of these modules is their adaptability to diverse engineering courses, suggesting broader applicability across disciplines. Moving forward, our research aims to expand the integration of the computational thinking modules into various courses in other institutes across the nation and analyze their impact on student performance."
9759837,"Investigating Elementary Teachers' Understanding, Beliefs, and Intentions toward STEM and Computational Thinking in Education","This study attempted to investigate elementary school teachers' understandings, beliefs, and intentions toward STEM and Computational Thinking. We collected data through a survey of 16 teachers at one elementary school in Malang City, Indonesia. They represented a variety of subjects with diverse learning experiences. The survey took place after the respondents received a short training about STEM and Computational Thinking. Quantitative analysis showed that most elementary school teachers positively demonstrated Computational Thinking practices in their schools. Besides, they believed that Computational Thinking could help students think logically, structurally, and creatively, while STEM helped train students to be problem solvers in an analytical, critical, and practical way.

10605886,Exploring Computational Thinking Perspectives in Black Communities with Physiological Computing,"Physiological computing (PC) technology is becoming increasingly popular as wearable hardware improves. However, little is known regarding potential connections between hands-on experience with physiological computing technology and computation thinking perspectives. This is particularly true for black communities. Applications for physiological computing include systems such as wearable technology (e.g., Apple Watch) capable of mapping students' physiological activity to various outputs. The work discussed in this paper presents our initial steps toward filling these gaps. In particular, we share our observations of computational thinking perspectives that emerged while black high school students constructed simple programs driven by near real-time brain wave information. Our findings suggest interactive physiological data may lead to unique computational perspectives during learning activities."

9684795,Mapping computational thinking mindsets between educational levels with cognitive network science,"A significant aspect of computational thinking is as a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction."
10496968,Exploring the Relationship Between Computational Thinking and Personality Traits,"To better understand the impact of students' personality on their computational thinking (CT), this paper develops a CT evaluation tool for college students. Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that teachers can pay attention to the individual differences of students from the perspective of personality, and provide them with suitable education to comprehensively improve students' CTS."
9867127,The Development of Students' Computational Thinking Practices in AI Course Using the Game-Based Learning: A Case Study,"Promoting the computational thinking of the K12 students through artificial intelligence education is reflected in curriculum standards and academic research.

9361128,Teaching Reform of Software Engineering Course Based on Computational Thinking,"For students majored in computer science, the ability to have computational thinking is an essential skill. Facilitating computational thinking cannot only help students understand the professional knowledge and principles of computer, but also bring new ideas to addressing complex problems, therefore, many colleges and universities have carried out computer professional curriculum reform based on computational thinking. Due to the high degree of abstraction of computational thinking, traditional teaching methods will cause students to understand computational thinking only at the conceptual level, and cannot realize the flexible use of computational thinking concepts. This study takes the software engineering course as an example to explain how to integrate the concepts of computational thinking into the original courses. The goal is to enable students to understand software engineering contents problems from the perspective of problem-solving."
9534576,Teaching research on the cultivation of computational thinking ability by using information technology,"Computational thinking ability is a very important, and it is a basic necessary skill for future talents.

9645630,Influence of Programming Robot Learning Mode Based on Conceptual Mapping on College Students' Computational Thinking,"As the information age has progressed, computational thinking ability to solve problems has become an indispensable way of life in life. Many scholars believe that the process of solving problems will be more logical if they have computational thinking ability. At the same time, scholars believe that a good learning method improves learners' intrinsic motivation. Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it. The students in the experimental group with conceptual mapping activities developed computational thinking skills during the program robotics course. The students in the control group first watched the computational thinking explanation video to explain the computational thinking skills to the students, and then taught in the traditional programming robotics course."

10159750,Fostering Critical and Computational Thinking in the Field of Primary and Secondary Education in non-STEM Subjects by Using Data Sets and Applications,"Critical and computational thinking in primary and secondary education in recent years shows growing importance in methodical approaches used in the classroom. Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market."
10343475,A Topic Modeling Approach to Characterizing Colombian Teachers' Conceptions of Computational Thinking,"This work-in-progress paper will explore the effectiveness of topic modeling to support the analysis of Colombian teachers' conceptions of computational thinking (in Spanish) in an online professional development program. Computational thinking has become a form of literacy as it can help individuals to solve problems. Consequently, governments and bodies of accreditation worldwide have supported educational initiatives, primarily at the K-12 level. However, curricular changes are not enough. Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space."
10685684,Does computational thinking really have an impact on academic performance? A systematic review,"This study is a systematic review of the effects of computational thinking on students’ academic performance from 2006 to 2023. The main purpose of this study is to explore whether computational thinking can promote students’ academic performance and the characteristics of such research. After literature collection and screening from three databases, a total of $\mathbf{2 3}$ articles were included. According to the coding table, the literature was coded in five aspects, including basic information, sample, research, computational thinking and academic performance. Then, the publication trend, research types, effect results, computational thinking measurement and the characteristics of academic achievement evaluation of the impact of computational thinking and academic achievement are reviewed.

10469197,Exploring the Impact of the Learning Sequence of Computational Thinking and Programming on Learning Outcomes,"The primary objective of this research was to investigate effective learning sequences starting with computational thinking, programming, or both. We experimented with and analyzed the learning sequence of students from the Department of Computer Engineering, Information Management, and Mechanical Engineering. The findings indicated that the students of the Department of Computer Engineering possessed prior experiences in programming or computational thinking. Their learning sequences limitedly impacted learning outcomes. Conversely, for the students of the Department of Information Management, learning computational thinking before programming did not result in better learning outcomes, emphasizing the need for coherence in courses. The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience."
10568269,Web Systems for the Development of Computational Thinking in Software Engineering Students: A Systematic Literature Review,"Many undergraduate students in software engineering have trouble developing computational thinking. Several tools have been reported in the literature to support the development of computational thinking. This paper reports a Systematic Literature Review to present the characteristics that have made successful web systems that support the development of computational thinking in recent years and the reported limitations. Eighteen primary studies were selected where the strategies used are usually learning through lessons, practicing with exercises, working through games, and using feedback. The systems found have been used at different elementary, middle, high school, and bachelor's degree levels. Finally, the main limitations reported in using these systems were mainly the difficulty of the topics, the previous knowledge that the students should have, the attitude that the students showed and the lack of motivation. Finally, we make some recommendations to software engineering curriculum planners and programming teachers about systems for developing computational thinking."
9725199,Developing a didactic sequence for introducing computational thinking in the early years of elementary school,"The employment of technology as a tool is a reality in any area of knowledge. Technology is present and permanently impacts our society, including its effects on education.

9725213,Development of Computational Thinking Skills: An Experience With Undergraduate Students,"Computational thinking is a type of analytical thinking that is developed intentionally, that is, under a “learned” approach, and the best way to learn it is through computer programming. In this paper, the experience of using block-based programming environments such as Scratch, Lightbot and the PSelnt pseudo-code tool for the understanding of computational concepts and development of computational thinking skills is reported. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. 85 first-year students from the Accounting Professional School of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa participated in the experience. The results show that in introductory programming courses of short time period, teaching with block-based programming environments compared to the use of pseudocode with the PSelnt tool, facilitates the appropriation of computational concepts and the development of computational thinking skills; thus obtaining better learning results. It is concluded that block-based programming environments favor the construction of knowledge and foster the development of creativity and algorithmic thinking."

10643971,"Developing Programming Competencies in School-Students With Block-Based Tools in Chile, Ecuador, and Peru","The information society is a reality nowadays, and computational thinking has become a relevant competence for everybody, regardless of age, social status, and primary activity. Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students’ autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level."
10893419,Assessing the Readiness of Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers in Utilizing the Scratch Application: A Case Study at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"This research-to-practice full paper describes the readiness of pre-service mathematics teachers to incorporate Scratch, a block-based programming application, into mathematics instruction, focusing on their knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Given the rapid technological advancements, leveraging technology in mathematics education is crucial in fostering proficient problem-solving abilities among students. Consequently, computational thinking is recognized as a vital 21st-century competency, a transferable skill for effective problem-solving methods. The study underscores the importance of integrating Scratch, a supportive tool in computational thinking, into mathematics education. However, to integrate this application into mathematics education, pre-service teachers must be prepared to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills and to be ready to accept its use in teaching in the future. The construction of knowledge by pre-service mathematics teachers regarding the Scratch application is examined through the lens of social constructivism, which emphasizes knowledge construction through experience and social interaction. A purposive sample of 60 first- and second-year students participated in an online survey. The sample selection involving two groups aimed to identify significant differences in pre-service teachers' readiness levels across gender, study year, and academic achievement. The findings revealed limited proficiency among pre-service mathematics teachers in utilizing Scratch, particularly regarding its integration into mathematics instruction. Several factors contribute to the deficiency in skills among pre-service mathematics teachers in navigating the Scratch application, including requiring additional time to grasp the programming language employed in the application, challenges in arranging blocks to achieve desired outputs, and struggles in rectifying syntax errors. However, there was a positive attitude towards the application, indicating a strong inclination to enhance their skills. The study also found no significant differences in demographic variables such as gender, study year, or academic achievement, but a slight correlation exists between knowledge, attitudes, and academic achievement. Investigating pre-service teachers' readiness to integrate Scratch into mathematics instruction sheds light into the intersection between mathematics pedagogy and computational thinking. This intersection underscores the importance of integrating programming tools like Scratch into mathematics education to cultivate computational thinking skills. Additionally, the findings contribute to the broader discourse on the role of technology in education and highlight the need for enhanced training and support for pre-service teachers in leveraging technology effectively for instructional purposes."

The reform of university computer basic courses guided by “computational thinking” has become an important direction for the current reform of computer public basic courses. In recent years, our school’s series of reform measures based on the public basic courses of computer have achieved obvious results, which proves that this orientation is worthy of promotion."
10343224,Towards iVProg4All: An Accessibility Test with Blind,"Computational thinking has become an essential skill nowadays. Many educational institutions around the world have adopted computational thinking as an elementary or complementary subject in their teaching schedules. One of the approaches that is efficient in teaching and learning computational thinking has been visual programming. However, like other applications used daily, visual programming tools can be a limiting factor for the blind in learning computational thinking. This work aims to present the iVProg4all, an accessible visual programming system based on forms. A preliminary study was carried out to test the usability of iVProg4all and accessibility with a blind user. The results show that, although some usability issues need to be fixed, the system proved accessible for blind people."
9576399,Removing the Walls Around Visual Educational Programming Environments,"Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. The paper presents NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing."
10636140,Navigating the Pitfalls: Analyzing the Behavior of LLMs as a Coding Assistant for Computer Science Students—A Systematic Review of the Literature,"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been employed significantly in different domains of computing education. Nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. However, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing LLM behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness. The finding also reports multiple research directions that can be considered in future research related to LLMs in computing education."
9962737,Interdisciplinary Computing Education: An Introductory Programming and Data Science Course for Postdoctoral Researchers in the Biosciences,"This Innovative-Practice Full Paper presents the curriculum development of an introductory course in programming and data science for postdoctoral researchers (PDRs) in the biosciences. The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education."
9481012,Bluetooth Communications in Educational Robotics,"In a world in a continuous and rapid change, it is absolutely necessary for our students to keep up with the rapid progress of new technologies: Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) etc. The rapid evolution and diversification of these emerging technologies has recently led to their introduction into the educational offer of the school curriculum for the gymnasium. The discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has already been implemented, a discipline that involves both the formation of skills to use new technologies and the formation of computational thinking necessary for the efficient and intelligent use of these technologies. In order to teach and learn Physics from a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) educational perspective, we initiated optional school courses of IoT, Robotics and AI (approached through Machine Learning). These courses stimulate, at the level of students, computational thinking, creativity and innovation and lead, from an interdisciplinary perspective, to the development of emerging specializations such as Mathematics-Physics-Automation, Mathematics-Physics-Electronics, Mathematics-Physics-Informatics-Robotics etc. In this paper we presented a method of approaching, in the school educational space, the study of wireless communication technologies between smart devices, through an Educational Robotics project. The project consisted of creating a wireless controlled mobile robotic platform (robot car) via a Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino Uno board."
9273818,Tracking Representational Flexibility Development through Speech Data Mining,"In this work-in-progress research we exploited and investigated a virtual reality (VR) based, flexibility learning environment (FLE) in which adolescents with autism use, customize, and design an assortment of simulation games that represent and exemplify the application of forces and Newton's laws of motion. The simulation/game modeling and making tasks acted as the primers of practicing and assessing representational flexibility in solving the engineering design problems with computational thinking. The participants' participation behaviors and verbal utterances during the intervention sessions have been archived via screen and webcam recordings. The current study findings indicated that two approaches of speech or text data mining, multi-label classification and similarity index, can act as the in-situ performance assessment methods to evaluate the representational flexibility development for engineering design and computational thinking of a heterogeneous learner group."
10343283,Coding Like a Data Miner: A Sandbox Approach to Computing-Based Data Science for High School Student Learning,"Personal health tracking devices and internet-based digital platforms with the capacity to collect, aggregate, and store data at massive scales are examples of tools that have broadened priorities in computing to include data science. In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand “big data.” This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, “Coding Like a Data Miner” (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of “big data” sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions."
10578608,How Various Educational Features Influence Programming Performance in Primary School Education,"In the digital age, programming education has become increasingly important, even in primary schools. However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success."
10343256,Enculturation of Students to Engineering and COVID's Impact Associated,"Enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as ASEE or IEEE. Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model."
10127310,Effectiveness of Metaphors in Problem Based Learning,"The paradigm of education has undergone a significant transition from traditional teacher-directed instruction to student-centered problem-based learning.

10935485,A Teaching Innovative Model of C++ Based on Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and Integration of ACM Competition and Teaching,"Aiming at the main problems of the traditional C++ course teaching, in this paper, a C++ teaching innovation model based on the concept of the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and the integration of the ACM competition and teaching is proposed based on the background of the era of the New Engineering. It takes the problem-solving and the live code as the main teaching line, takes the information technology teaching as the means, promotes the students’ integration of the theory and practice by the ACM/ICPC competition, and organically combines the process assessment and the final assessment, and implements the diversified assessment forms. For theoretical teaching, the authors put forward an innovative model of C++ teaching based on the concept of the OBE and the combination of the ACM competition and teaching. For practical teaching, the authors designed a keyword-oriented OJ system to address the problem of the large differences in the programming ability among the students. For the course assessment, the authors designed a C++ multi-topic intelligent online examination system. The results of more than ten years’ practical teaching show that the innovative model of the C++ teaching based on the OBE concept and the ACM competition has effectively cultivated the students’ computational thinking and significantly improved their programming ability and innovation ability. In the past ten years, our students won many ACM/ICPC prizes. At present, this teaching innovation model has been effectively promoted and applied in three campuses of our university. It has a certain leading and exemplary role in cultivating the top-notch innovative talents in the field of the computer science with the excellent professional programming ability, computational thinking, the national sentiment, the global vision and the all-round development."

9388156,8 Computational Heterogeneity: A Radical Reflection,"In Experience and Education, Dewey argued that humankind is “given to formulating its beliefs in terms of Either-Ors, between which it recognizes no intermediate possibilities.” Not surprisingly, educational computing is no exception. One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing."
10869207,Gamification Elements in Virtual Simulation Integrated Learning: A Quantitative Evaluation with the 5E Instructional Model,"Programming and robot building are two crucial components in an AI curriculum, while students' learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement are important dimensions to measure students' learning outcomes. In previous teaching practice, virtual simulation platforms are often used as teaching aids, and the operational difficulty of the platforms may reduce students' interest in learning, thus lowering the learning effect. Therefore, based on the 5E teaching model, this study combines gamification elements with virtual simulation integrated learning to explore its effects on the three dimensions of students' learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement."

9668057,Intelligent Traffic Light System Using Image Processing,"Nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city.

10332983,Repo-Educ: Repository of Educational Robotics Lesson Plans,"Educational robotics is a practice that has been disseminated in Brazil and in the world, allowing the inclusion of technology in the school environment through stimulating pedagogical activities for students, making them practice teamwork, fine motor coordination, and computational thinking, among other benefits. For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community."

9234342,Analysis of Repeat Learners in Computer Science MOOCs,"Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes."
9238207,Coding Training Proposal for Kindergarten,"Computational thinking in recent years has been universally defined as the ”new English”, or basic knowledge necessary for everyone. As English, is important to include it as early as possible in teaching programs, right from preschool. This need is so felt as to make it, for example, compulsory in kindergarten in Italy since 2022. Obviously, this implies the use of simple tools that do not provide reading and writing skills. This work proposes a learning program which could be carried out precisely during the three years of kindergarten, from 3 to 6 years of age, and prepares children for coding, a teaching subject that has already been proposed in Italy for primary school since a few years."

10261563,Automatic Academic Emotion Recognition and Its Evolution Analysis in Classroom,"Students' emotional state plays a vital role in learning. In this study, we examined the emotional changes of 69 students during the lectures of the C Language Programming Foundation and Computational Thinking in central China. This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8–10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively."

10004399,Learning Algebra with Robotics in Math Classes,"An increasing number of tools have been created to assist students in learning mathematics. Robots have been regarded as an especially powerful tool to help students master mathematics since students can simultaneously learn mathematics, programming, robotic control, and computational thinking. Although a number of educational robots and curricula have been developed, some of them do not comply with math standards, so they are primarily suitable for after-school programs, camps, or workshops. Students might not be able to focus on learning mathematics now that writing a program might be difficult for them due to debugging. In this paper, mathematics curricula that meet math standards are developed with a block-based programming platform, Roboblocky. Linkbots are utilized as robots in the curricula to teach and learn mathematics in school settings. Students learn mathematics by observing the motions of robots in simulations or on real mats. Most students improved greatly in mathematics after using the curricula. It is expected that the curricula based on Roboblocky will continue to be improved to enable more middle and high school students to be successful in learning mathematics."

10908001,Design and Implementation of a Programmable Dynamic Geometry System with Support for Reverse Debugging,"Dynamic geometry systems (DGS) are widely used in mathematics education to enhance students' thinking skills through geometric exploration. Integrating programming into DGS fosters both mathematical and computational thinking. However, research on reverse debugging design for programmable dynamic geometry systems is limited, and existing systems fail to meet the needs for operation reversal. To address this, this paper proposes a programming environment that supports reverse debugging, aiming to overcome the limitations of current programmable dynamic geometry systems in debugging. We abstracted dynamic geometry operations and defined three types of drawing instructions. To ensure sequential execution and debugging, we designed a debuggable sequential execution algorithm, followed by a reverse debugging control algorithm. The effectiveness of the system is verified by experiments."

9813884,Cybersecurity Based Simulation of Connected Automated Vehicles for Instructional Use,"A car moving at a speed of x mph, comes to a sudden halt after traveling y miles. What is the time taken by the car to reach z miles ahead of y? A high school student probably gets frustrated by questions like these on the ground that inquiries in arithmetic. The idea of implementing hacking on a smart car should improve student’s interest and motivate them to pursue careers in STEM-related areas. However, if the same example was demonstrated to them using a smart car prototype which was hacked, then there is a good chance they can get attracted towards Technology and Computing. When similar examples, involving the various other topics in their syllabus, are shown, they’ll probably get to see the real-life applications of the topics they study during high school and after that. This paper introduces a new attempt that aims at inclining the interest of high school students towards the courses in the STEM (which have an escalating carrier aspect), improving their computational thinking capability, and making them aware of today’s cybersecurity issues."
10578675,Piloting of a Computer Science Content Knowledge Test for 10th Grade Students*,"New (interdisciplinary) Computer Science (CS) subjects in K-12 education have been introduced in recent years. Most of them have educational plans derived from CS Frame-works such as the K-12 CS Framework. To some extent the educational plans have the same core topic areas: data and coding (including data compression and data structures), algorithms (in-volving variables and software projects), computers and networks (covering topics like logic tables and data transmission) and information society and data security (consisting of collection and processing of personal data and asymmetric encryption). Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas. These core topic areas are part of the educational plan of the new interdisciplinary subject IMP (Informatics, Mathematics, Physics) for secondary schools in Germany. The test was piloted with 156 (m = 117, f = 37, o = 2) 10th grade students, approximately aged 16 at the end of the lower secondary level. We used the Item-Response-Theory (IRT) to validate the test. This work in progress paper presents translated items and the psychometric evaluation of the piloted test.

10170028,Effect of Operation Span on IoT Courses for Junior High School Students in Taiwan,"Learning how to program has become a trend in Taiwan even for younger students. IoT is a topic to interest new learners in programming. Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students’ learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one’s working memory capacity. According to the research results, one’s working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students’ cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject. We designed an experiment for an IoT-related after-school club in a junior high school to evaluate the relationship between students’ operation span and learning performance."

Two of the authors have been involved in the re-design, implementation and execution of a basic programming and CT course, offered to first-semester students as part of the Information science, IT and interaction design bachelor program, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The central problem we faced in restructuring our introductory course, was finding a game genre that could support creative coding for beginners, be motivational and recognizable by the students, and would work with our use-modify-create learning approach. Our findings suggest that point-and-click games are an effective way to provide scaffolding and ease non-technical students into P5 programming. The genre has good expressive power, and the students were motivated because they recognized and could relate to the games they worked on. Future work will address students’ problems with scaling up the point-and-click games."
10315732,Automatic Assessment of Programming Exercises Using Syntactic Analysis,"This paper proposes a method to grade programming exam questions automatically. Our motivation is that there are no robust and scalable automatic methods for the analysis of computational thinking from source code programmed by elementary-level students. The approach to this problem supports the improvement of PC development in primary and secondary school students. The validation of the method is performed through the assessment of the answers of primary school students to programming exercises using a programming language called LIE++. The method assesses student answers using several techniques such as the analysis of programming structures, code clones and the execution of code based on input and output values defined during the specification of the exercises. The use of these techniques provides specific scores to obtain a grade of the student’s answer. The source code analysis and scoring of exercise answers is carried out using high-performance computing for improving system response time. This research contributes a scalable method for the automatic evaluation of exams, which we expect to support the development of PC."

9163380,A Computation Model for Learning Programming and Emotional Intelligence,"Introducing coding in early education improves the logical and computational thinking in kids. However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface."
9661274,"Novelette, a Usable Visual Storytelling Digital Learning Environment","Educational digital storytelling is widely recognised as a powerful approach in developing literary skills, experiencing problem-solving and computational thinking, information and knowledge visualisation, building creativity and divergent thinking supported by technological solutions. However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else’s story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. We can conclude that Novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity."
9637460,My Robot can tell stories: Introducing robotics and physical computing to children using dynamic dioaramas,"From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion."
9583623,Teaching and Learning Tools for Introductory Programming in University Courses,"Difficulties in teaching and learning introductory programming have been studied over the years. The students’ difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. Early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. This work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities."
9125187,Effects of a Hackathon on the Motivation and Grades of CS1 Students,"Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students."
9274172,Educational Pyramid Scheme – A Sustainable Way Of Bringing Innovations To School,"Full paper. One of the biggest challenges in education is the transfer of innovations and new didactic approaches into the school system. To ensure a high standard of teaching, it is essential that the teachers' expertise, pedagogical content knowledge as well as digital competences are continuously improved by further training. In-service training for teachers is offered in different settings (short-, middle- and long term), with advantages and disadvantages. Two aspects that correlate positively are the costs and the sustainable outcome of these trainings. With these aspects in mind the Educational Pyramid Scheme (EPS) is currently being developed and implemented as part of an Erasmus Plus project. It is an innovative concept that aims at spreading new learning contents and methods in a relatively short time within the school system, with low costs and high effect. It is inspired by the economical pyramid scheme, which is designed to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities. The transaction content of the Educational Pyramid Scheme refers to methods or strategies that are being exchanged, and to the resources and capabilities that are required to enable the exchange. According to a train-the-trainer principle, teachers and pupils will be qualified to be trainers, who then spread their knowledge and skills to people in their school and beyond. The EPS contains three different functions or roles: multipliers (teachers and scientists), mentors (teachers) and tutors (pupils). The motivation to participate is maintained with a benefit system adapted for each target group. The training of target groups follows high qualitative standards and therefore presents different phases: input, practical phase and reflection. This paper describes the development of the EPS and its first implementation in the framework of the Austrian mandatory curriculum ""Basic Digital Education"" including computational thinking and programming. It presents some qualitative results gained so far from interviews and observation, which are satisfactory and deliver good arguments for the further implementation of the EPS."
9781075,Let the Games Speak by Themselves: Towards Game Features Discovery Through Data-Driven Analysis and Explainable AI,"The idea behind this work is to start exploring the application of data analytics and (explainable) machine learning techniques to better understand games and discover new features that will possibly help in effectively exploiting them in different socially useful domains. We prove the feasibility of the idea by: (i) collecting a large dataset of board game information; (ii) designing and testing an information processing pipeline for automatically discovering game categories and game mechanics, with some first encouraging results. In the future, we plan to further generalize this approach for different kinds of games and for discovering currently unknown but useful aspects, e.g. games or game features that could better foster Computational Thinking in education, those better suited to be applied in social distancing contexts, and so on."
9223495,"""Oh no, my instructions were wrong!"" An Exploratory Pilot Towards Children’s Trust in Social Robots","Whilst there has been growing interest in the use of social robots in educational settings, the majority of this research focuses on learning outcomes, with less emphasis on the social processes surrounding these interactions. One such understudied factor is children’s trust in the robot as a teacher. Trust is a relevant domain in that if and how children trust a robot could influence their subsequent learning outcomes. The extent to which the robot’s behaviour (including making errors) influences trust is yet to be fully explored. Consequently, the goal of this research is to determine the role of trust in children’s learning from social robots. We report a pilot study investigating the conceptualisation and measurement of chil-dren’s trust in robots. 33 children aged between 4-9 completed a computational thinking learning task with a NAO robot at a Science Festival. Observations of the interactions in terms of developing tasks and measurements for child robot interaction are discussed. The findings tentatively suggest children’s trust in the robot can be divided into two parts: social affiliation towards the robot, and perceived competence/reliability of the robot."
10444509,Human-Centered Digital Sustainability: Handling Enumerated Lists in Digital Texts,"In advance to the present study, the authors introduced a method which makes it possible to calculate the entropy of natural language digital texts, focusing on word-processed texts, presentations, and webpages. This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses – the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data – generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group ( $2\times67$  hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students’ and end-users’ computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability – beyond hardware and software development and recycling – with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. However, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate."
9148105,Adapting to User Interest Drifts for Recommendations in Scratch,"Scratch is a popular programming platform with plenty of learning resources. However, it is quite difficult for users to find suitable resources. In this paper, in order to provide the resources which the users require, we propose a Scratch Recommendation Framework Adaptive to User Interest Drifts (SRFA-UID). First, a user interest drifts model is designed, which adopts the time decay factor and the weights of operation behaviors to track users' dynamic interest. Then, on the basis of users' current and historical interest, we calculate their combined user similarity. Next, we present a novel two-hop-algorithm to update users' friend community. Considering the preferences of the whole friend community, the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users and the impact factors of items, we put forward a recommendation function to obtain items that are related to users. For an item, the function can calculate its F value to determine if we can recommend it to the users. Experimental results show that SRFA-UID performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in the Scratch dataset."
10139678,Hands-on Active Learning Approach to Teach Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning to Elementary and Middle School Students,"The last decade has seen a surge in expanding access to Computer Science (CS) education, especially for K-12, with many states even stipulating student learning standards in CS and Computational Thinking (CT). Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9–12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6–8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs. We describe a detailed AI/ML lesson plan based on standards and framework, AI4K12 big ideas, art and science of curriculum design, active learning, and culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy. Then we discuss our experiences in teaching the same to $\boldsymbol{4}^{\mathbf{th}}$ grade students in an elementary school."
10005170,Abstracted Power and Responsibility in Computer Science Ethics Education,"As computing becomes more powerful and extends the reach of those who wield it, the imperative grows for computing professionals to make ethical decisions regarding the use of that power. We propose the concept of abstracted power to help computer science students understand how technology may distance them perceptually from consequences of their actions. Specifically, we identify technological intermediation and computational thinking as two factors in computer science that contribute to this distancing. To counter the abstraction of power, we argue for increased emotional engagement in computer science ethics education, to encourage students to feel as well as think regarding the potential impacts of their power on others. We suggest four concrete pedagogical approaches to enable this emotional engagement in computer science ethics curriculum, and we share highlights of student reactions to the material."
10143930,The Artificial Intelligence Learning Anxiety and Self-Efficacy of In-Service Teachers Taking AI Training Courses,"This research explored the degree of learning self-efficacy of machine learning experience (MLSE) and artificial intelligence learning anxiety (AILA) of elementary and junior high school teachers. The participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. This research applied the AI2 Robot City, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. The learning content was image classification for AI application. Elementary and junior high school teachers operated the MIT App Inventor(MAI) and Personal Image Classifier(PIC) platform, and trained the model for practicing AI to implement supervised machine learning on the PIC platform. The learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of MAI. They completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the AI2 Robot City board game. In order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the AI teacher training workshop, the MLSE and AILA scales were administered before and after the classes. A total of 28 samples were collected. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the MLSE of the elementary and junior high school teachers. However, the average AILA degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application. Future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their AILA and MLSE with time and as training courses increase."
9964176,UMP STEM Bot as educational kit for robotics and computer programming,"We present UMP STEM Bot, an open-source robotic platform, for educational use that covers a wide spectrum of black-box and white-box learning objectives. The building structure of UMP STEM Bot and its learning outcomes are described. The educational kit is scalable to a more advance application as it is built based on the open-source technology. The UMP STEM Bot is a viable low-cost robotic manipulator platform alternative for introductory courses such as basics of robotics, computational thinking, and programming, as well as for advance courses at the university level such as intelligent robotics."
9962584,Design an Assessment for an Introductory Computer Science Course: A Systematic Literature Review,"This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students’ CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students’ background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students’ understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students’ knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use."
9794193,Exploring Diversity in Introductory Programming Classes: An Experience Report,"Digitization is becoming part of almost everyone’s life, ranging from smartphones and tablets, smart devices automatically collecting information, to tools and scripting languages that are widely available and easy to use. This has recently been reflected in various university curricula, where courses such as computational thinking, and basic programming classes are now included in a broader range of (non-computer-science) programs. However, these programs often face challenges in such courses due to their diverse student body, with students often lacking profound digital competencies and technical background. While gender diversity aspects have been broadly studied in the past, other diversity dimensions such as ethnicity, age, or educational background have largely been neglected thus far. In this paper, we report on our experiences in teaching an introductory programming course to first-year Business Informatics bachelor students. After undergoing fundamental changes in our teaching concepts and the provided learning material, we explore what diversity factors play an important role when teaching programming to non-computer science students, and how diversity is perceived by lecturers and tutors. Our analysis confirms that a collaborative teaching concept positively supports female students and students with language barriers."
9766768,Evaluating Usability and Educational Effectiveness of a Serious Game for Programmers Using Alternative Interfaces and Types of Activities,"This paper presents a serious game that has been developed for programmers aiming to analyze and examine the effectiveness and the perceived usability of two different game interfaces. This game presents a drag-and-drop interface and a classical typing interface and towards this approach, four different versions of the same game were developed. Each version of the game focuses on either creating a part of code or debugging (finding the errors in the code provided). The game enables the players to advance their programming skills and computational thinking by engaging them in problem-solving activities during the gameplay. This paper provides insight and focuses on the evaluation of different interfaces in a serious game that is developed for programmers and targets fundamental programming concepts."
9969519,A Case Study on Learning Visual Programming With TutoApp for Composition of Tutorials: An Approach for Learning by Teaching,"Teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on “Learning by Teaching,” where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre–posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students."
10342942,Motivating the New Generation: Using Flipped Classroom and ARCS Model to Enhance Block-Based Programming Education,"This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an explorative study investigating the effects of flipped learning on the learning motivation of primary school students enrolled in a block-based programming course. Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction."
9453965,Build your own robot,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pilot test framed in educational robotics where parents and child work together during the same session. In recent years, an educational movement has emerged that is related to the introduction of computational thinking, programming, and robotics in schools. Educational robotics is presented as one more resource that serves as a support in the different curricular subjects and facilitates the emergence of skills such as socialization, creative spirit and personal initiative, allowing participants to find answers to the problems that may arise in their reality. It is for this reason that a pilot test was carried out where we included the participants' parents in a session. To do this we used the Crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. This platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. From the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people. At the end of the experience, the assistants completed the assembly of their own robot. The article contains a study of the state of the art of using educational robotics. It also includes an analysis of the different tools mostly used in educational robotics. Also, throughout the article the learning methodology used, the different educational resources and the results obtained from the experience are described."
9973573,Integrating Computer Science and Physical Education in Elementary Schools with Data Science Learning Modules Using Wearable Microcontrollers,"With limited time in the school day to meet required state-level objectives across subjects, it is challenging to meet the need to address declining physical activity levels and to incorporate additional computer science instruction in elementary schools. Project moveSMART uses a web-based platform to integrate opportunities for physical education with computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) learning activities. Fourth grade students who underwent a single-day intervention experienced a significant improvement in their interest in coding and their perceptions of coders. This paper presents a series of three new lessons in the fifth grade moveSMART curriculum that allow students to create and improve a physical activity monitor. We employ a project-based learning approach to expose students to data analysis and machine learning in the framework of classification and pattern recognition."
9962664,CS Pathways: A Culturally Responsive Computer Science Curriculum for Middle School,"In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we report on CS Pathways, a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA. The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students’ culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All. This paper advocates for the need for culturally-responsive computing, describes how it is integrated into teachers’ instruction, and presents the CS Pathways curriculum design."
9620713,Making Research Practice Partnerships Work: An Assessment of The Maker Partnership,"Strong, equitable research practice partnerships (RPPs) center both researcher and practitioner perspectives and priorities. These RPPs facilitate rigorous, relevant research that practitioners can use to improve program implementation. Our project, The Maker Partnership, is an RPP focused on building knowledge about how to help elementary level teachers integrate computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) into their regular science classes using maker pedagogy. In this experience report, we use the Henrich et al. framework to assess the Maker Partnership's effectiveness along five dimensions and share practical advice and lessons learned. This paper contributes to the CS and RPP literature by providing insight into how an RPP can address critical problems of practice in computer science education."
10148382,AP-Coach: formative feedback generation for learning introductory programming concepts,"In this work, we aim to improve code writing skill in Python-based introductory programming courses for first-year university students. In such courses, students as novice programmers would benefit from personalised and formative feedback to: 1) quickly identify issues in their computational thinking process or coding techniques, and 2) know how to proceed when facing a certain problem. Due to the large number of students, it is impractical for instructors to manually assess all the work of each student to provide tailored feedback. We design and implement Automatic Programming Coach (AP-Coach), a web-based tool for automatically generating formative feedback for exercises on basic programming concepts. AP-Coach combines software engineering techniques (code similarity measures based on abstract syntax trees, and unit testing), and AI techniques (machine translation) in a novel manner to provide relevant feedback. We report promising results for AP-Coach in the following aspects: 1) quantitative evaluation of code similarity computation and machine translation, 2) qualitative evaluation of the perceived quality and usability of auto-generated feedback, and 3) experience of a selected group of computing students using the system."
10585562,Programming Games as Learning Tools: Using Empathic Design Principles for Engaging Experiences,"As computational thinking (CT) emerges as a required skill in the modern educational and professional landscape, the use of games for learning programming has gained prominence. However, consideration for the user's needs and experiences is as important as the educational content itself, in order to ensure that the learner has an engaging experience. For this reason, this paper explores the integration of Empathic Design principles into the user experience (UX) evaluation of several popular programming genre games aimed at cultivating CT. The findings indicate a partial positive alignment with these principles, particularly in user-centric design, learning journey, and visual aspects. Learner-players feedback emphasized engaging experiences and visual appeal, while improvement suggestions centered on enhancing interface depth, providing clearer instructions, and addressing challenges for beginners and scalability issues."
9569421,Diversified Teaching Evaluation of Python Programming Based on OBE Concept,"Python language programming is a general education course for college students, which cultivates students' computational thinking ability and the ability to use computers to solve problems. Teaching design based on OBE concept for different majors, using diversified teaching evaluation methods based on process evaluation. Effectively combine the Python curriculum framework system designed based on the OBE concept with a diversified teaching evaluation system, and use fuzzy clustering to process and analyze evaluation data. It is expected to provide a certain reference for the OBE-based curriculum system and evaluation system."
10343210,Towards Digital Skills for All Pre-service Teachers: Collecting Good Curricular Practices,"The goal of this research full paper is to provide insight into most recent findings of interviews with faculty members teaching digital skills in an integrated and innovative way embedded into courses on subject didactics of a teacher education program. Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future."
9307023,A comprheensive review of Visual Programming Tools for Arduino,"This document presents a systematic review of Visual Programming Tools for the Arduino Board. The Arduino board is an embedded platform that focus on enabling an easy way to teach embedded systems, but, due to its success, it ended up being used in different teaching levels, ranging from primary to university. The board was also applied in the teaching of robotics and other contexts since it is relatively cheap, easy to program and its community has produced a considerable amount of free educational material. Even though Arduino is a success it is still maturing in terms of educational purposes, aside the electronic knowledge that needs to be explored, the board is programmed, by default, with c++, which is considered not friendly to Computer Thinking beginners. Trying to solve this problem, many solutions apply Visual Programming, which is proven to make it easy for unexperienced and even children to learn the basis of Computational Thinking, in the educational context with Arduino. Even though there are many solutions applying visual programming for Arduino, there are no systematic review or survey on this subject, meaning that it is hard to identify where are the gaps and which are the problems that are already solved. Therefore, on this paper, it was performed a systematic review on the subject, the method found 372 papers, which 31 were selected for full review. The reviewed solutions where discussed and categorized, we expect that the presented results could be used as guideline for new research in the area and by educators and companies that are looking for visual programming tools for the Arduino board."
9962686,A Framework for teaching programming in High School through Educational Robotics,"This Research-to-Practice Full Paper aims to introduce a methodological framework to foster Computational Thinking (CT) skills by teaching programming with Educational Robotics (ER) in High School. Problem-solving is an essential skill for human development, so it is necessary to introduce actions to improve this skill in High School. It is possible to stimulate problem- solving through computer programming teaching with ER. However, as far as we know, there are no methodologies for teaching programming with ER focusing on CT development in High School that went through scientific validation of the proposal. This study is an Educational Design Research that aims to introduce a methodological framework for teaching programming in High School with ER (named CTProgER) and validate two instances of the framework. It was considered consolidated teaching methodologies with ER, combined with the Anthropological Theory of Didactics and evidence from our ER studies. As a result, we present the CTProgER Framework guideline, two instances of the CTProgER Framework, and these instances’ validation through the Delphi method."
9794152,A Project-Based Collaboration between Software Engineering and Criminology Students : Building Applications to Understand Racial Injustice in the Criminal Justice System,"Undergraduate software engineering courses typically require students to work on team-based projects that reinforce disciplinary content and soft skills. At the same time, these students, particularly those at liberal arts institutions, are required to take courses that focus on civic issues, including on racial and ethnic inequality. Often, students perceive these courses to be outside their disciplinary areas, and may not comprehend how these topics are applicable to computer science and software engineering. This paper reports on the experience of Pulimood and Leigey as they and their students grappled with issues of racial injustice in the criminal justice system, and drew upon their own disciplinary backgrounds to apply computational thinking and software engineering principles to help the community better understand these issues and advocate for reform. The paper also describes the experience of teaching courses from different disciplines in a collaborative model, working closely with a local community partner to support its work on an identified social issue, and the learning outcomes, as well as the benefits and challenges of this approach. Recommendations and future directions are also discussed."
10562294,Use of Virtual Reality as an Educational Tool: A Comparison Between Engineering Students and Teachers,"Today, teaching faces several challenges, including students’ difficulty in understanding abstract concepts and lack of motivation. To address these problems, the use of virtual reality (VR) has been explored as an innovative and potentially effective educational tool. However, so far, the effectiveness of VR applications and the perception of their use lack a clear and effective approach to be used to support education. The importance of addressing this problem lies in the need to improve the quality of teaching using emerging technologies. It is for this reason that it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of teaching using VR. In this context, this research presents the results of the FreeDev application, previously validated with 20 teachers and with 80 engineering students from a private university. FreeDev is a VR application designed to support the teaching of basic programming, it is aimed as an educational tool to provide an immersive experience to students on how to get started in programming and computational thinking. FreeDev has been well accepted, and both teachers and engineering students see it as a tool that can be used to support education. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of education."

Such integration provides the learners with essential industrial skills crucial in modern industries."
9659152,Neural-Physical Fusion Computation for Container Terminal Handling Systems by Computational Logistics and Deep Learning,"The emerging information technology and the rising computational thinking make it possible to establish new theoretical methods and engineering practices for planning, scheduling, control and decision-making of complex logistics systems. Consequently, the complex logistics systems oriented neural-physical fusion computation (CLSO-NPFC) is proposed initially to discuss and explore the decision issues of complex logistics systems at all the strategic, tactical and operational levels. By CLSO-NPFC, the container terminal oriented logistics generalized computing mechanization, automation and intelligence are constructed uniformly and tentatively, and the typical deep learning model neural computing architecture (DLM-NCA) in CLSO-NPFC is designed for the prediction of calling liner handling volume that is measured by container units rather than twenty-feet equivalent unit. A typical regional container terminal along the coast of China is selected to implement, execute and evaluate the DLM-NCA, and the DLM-NCA shows the agile, efficient and robust performance for forecasting with the low and stable computation consumption. It demonstrates the feasibility, credibility and practicality of the abstract principles, design paradigms and computing architecture in CLSO-NPFC preliminarily."
9274215,Design and Evaluation of a Teaching-Related Knowledge Sharing System to Meet the Needs of Computer Science Instructors,"This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors."
10419197,Utilization of Information Entropy in Training and Evaluation of Students’ Abstraction Performance and Algorithm Efficiency in Programming,"Contribution: This research illuminates information entropy’s efficacy as a pivotal educational tool in programming, enabling the precise quantification of algorithmic complexity and student abstraction levels for solving P problems. This approach can provide students quantitative, comparative insights into the differences between optimal and student implemented solution, and allowing educators to offer targeted feedback, thereby optimizing the learning and abstraction processes in algorithm design through deliberate practice. Background: Abstraction is considered one of the most impor11 tant skills in problem solving. Many studies in programming have shown that higher abstraction capability can significantly simplify problems, reduce program complexity and improve efficiency. However, it is difficult to develop criteria to measure the level of abstraction, and there is still a lack of relevant systematic research. Research Questions: 1) How can students’ abstraction ability in programming be effectively measured? 2) How to develop programming education and training methods based on the measurement of abstraction ability? Methodology: Forty-six grade 10 students participated in the experiment, divided into two groups for programming train23 ing using information-entropy-based assessment and traditional learning methods. Their level of computational thinking, algo25 rithmic efficiency improvements, and test scores were used to measure performance and to analyze the effectiveness of the training methods. Findings: Through empirical research, this article finds that information-entropy-based assessment can reflect the differences in problem solving among students possessing varying capa31 bilities. Information entropy can be crucial for evaluating and improving students’ abstraction performance and algorithm efficiency."

However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect."

9974671,Future Lower Primary School Teachers Taking an Online Algorithmization and Programming Course and Self-Assessing their Performance,"Computational thinking, problem-solving and the ability to apply knowledge; these and a plethora of other skills are essential for success in both personal and professional life. In order to be able to develop those skills in their students, the teachers themselves need to possess them. This paper focuses on female future lower primary school teachers who, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, took an online course on algorithmization and programming, having little or no prior knowledge and skills. The completion rate depended not only on the students' motivation and willingness to learn, but mainly on the content and structure of the course, which was completely modified and made into an online course. The results were more than surprising. The students were able to complete the activities included in the course. Moreover, those activities inspired them to create their own activities, which they may be able to use in their future classes."

10366359,Educational robotics to enhance knowledge and skills in higher education: A systematic review,"Because of its ability to prepare students for the 21st century world of work, educational robotics (RE) has assumed a prominent role in education. Following the methodology provided by Kitchenham, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive overview of studies, research, and practices related to robotics education in higher education. The study focuses on identifying the most commonly used RE hardware-based platforms in academic research publications, the type of knowledge intended to be imparted, and the skills or competencies reinforced by the platforms. Within the findings we can underline that there is no exclusive platform, but rather commercial ones are used, made by the researchers themselves, and even adapted from robots that were not designed for instructional purposes. Moreover, the subjects intended to be taught were all related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and oriented to electrical engineering, electronics, robotics, and computer science professions. On the other hand, the skills that improved the most were computational thinking, cooperation and sophisticated problem solving, which are essential for 21st century job descriptions."
10569762,Programming STEAM Applications in Informatics Education and Their Use in Biology Education,"In this paper, we present a proposal for a series of STEAM activities developing students’ computational thinking, improving their health literacy, and consequently taking care of their own well-being. The implementation of these activities in the classroom requires not only the knowledge and skills of informatics and biology, but also the collaboration of teachers of both subjects. These activities are implemented in phases, starting in biology lesson and continuing in informatics lesson. The first activity tests the level of sensitivity of people to colour differences. The second activity trains human adaptation to psychological stress. The third activity is focused on creation of compensatory aid that compensates for colour perception disorder. The design and programming of students’ STEAM applications is a meaningful way to use informatics in problem solving. Using and experimenting with these applications helps students to better understand the biological content. STEAM approach strengthens students’ orientation towards interdisciplinary studies (e.g. bioinformatics) at the higher education level and helps them to be more employable in the labour market."
10894719,Supporting Learning Processes using Emerging Technologies and Gamification,"In the last decades, our society has become massively technology-dependent. Various solutions, such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), can be involved in learning processes to enhance the students’ experience, while elements of gamification can be implemented to engage and keep the users motivated. In this paper, we summarize current research and introduce our relevant development projects about students’ algorithmic, programming, and visual skills. One of the tangible results of our research is an in-house serious game development project.

10305646,Octave: An End-User Programming Environment for Analysis of Spatiotemporal Data for Construction Students,"The construction industry is a new avenue for big data and data science with sensors and cyber-physical systems deployed in the field. Construction students need to develop computational thinking skills to help make sense of this data, but existing data science environments designed with textual programming languages create a significant barrier to entry. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octave, an end-user programming environment designed to help non-expert programmers analyze spatiotemporal data (e.g., as gathered by a GPS sensor) in an interactive graphical user interface. To aid exploration and understanding, Octave's design incorporates a high degree of liveness, highlighting the interconnection between data, computation, and visualization. We share the underlying design principles behind Octave and details about the system design and implementation. To evaluate Octave, we conducted a usability study with students studying construction. The results show that non-programmer construction students were able to learn Octave easily and were able to effectively use it to solve domain-specific problems from construction education. The participants appreciated Octave's liveness and felt they could easily connect it to real-life problems in their field. Our work informs the design of future accessible end-user programming environments for data analysis targeting non-experts."
9457993,Black Political Participation in the Volunteer State,"There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have ""turned-off"" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, ""all politics are local,"" and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups."
10127288,Effectiveness of Game Based Learning in Problem Based Learning,"Problem based learning has been adapted by various universities and inscribed with perspectives based on the demographic challenges. The method known to be effective for producing lifelong learners and improve cognitive skills, has been experimented on several facades. Problems, being major drivers in the process, have been researched to design and the deliberate the most effective ways. Through this paper we propose a game based learning model which can be used as problems in a problem based learning framework. In contrast to learning activities supplied using more old-fashioned didactic methodologies, this strategy can be used to engage a student through meaningful activities. This paper presents a model to use game in problem based learning followed by a case study and its analysis. Giglane game was used in the process to analyze the effectiveness with respect to number of stakeholders and incidents reported. The method is validated for effectiveness and promises to be an effective strategy for reflections and self-directed learning attributes. The method directly supports the decomposition structure from the computational thinking methodology which can be combined with the problem based learning process."
10893535,"Interdisciplinary TPACK: A Case Study Using Variables, I/O, and Loops with Graduate Teacher Candidates in a Methods Course","This research paper describes the mathematics teacher knowledge transformation when computer science concepts are integrated with mathematics. During the last decade, schools and educators made a significant effort to introduce Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12. While this effort produced some positive results in schools where resources and specialized educators are available, there are school districts where creating new classes and/or hiring specialized teachers is not a sustainable option. This creates a need for teachers that are specialized in one subject area to expand their knowledge into CS and CT, and teach these concepts in their classes. This knowledge expansion and integration should result in creating integrated curricula using their subject matter knowledge and the newly acquired CS knowledge. This implies that the teacher should be able to identify the intersection of concepts between the two fields, and leverage their difference and similarities to promote deep learning for their students. The current study explores how the teacher candidates' technological, pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in mathematics is affected when mathematical concepts are integrated with CS and CT. This study is a three-day intervention in a graduate level secondary mathematics education methods course, where utilizing Math + CS integrated modules we infuse CS concepts into mathematics. The already known mathematics context reduced the cognitive load for familiarizing the teacher candidates with CS, and the integration of the CS concepts provided a different perspective for thinking about mathematics and teaching. After having the teacher candidates reflecting on the concepts of Variable and Equal Sign (=), our results showed that they started noticing the differences and nuances between the two fields, developing this way their interdisciplinary Math + CS TPACK (I-TPACK) knowledge. Furthermore, the study showed that representing multiplications using repetition structures illuminated the internal mechanic of multiplication and its properties. Finally, the experience with the strict grammar and syntax rules of programming illuminated the areas in the teacher candidates mathematics instruction that were ambiguous in the way they teach variables, equations, percentages, and multiplication."
10893287,Innovative Approaches in Education: A Systematic Literature Review on Computer-Supported Collaborative Activities and Digital Inclusion for Youth and Adult Education,"This research full paper presents a systematic review exploring methods and pedagogical strategies utilized for digitally including adult education students through computer-assisted collaborative activities. Youth and adult education faces significant disparities along the globe, with low enrollment rates in many countries as highlighted in the UNESCO's $5^{th}$ Global Report. Whenever we consider the $4^{th}$ United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal for 2030, education aims for inclusion and lifelong learning opportunities. With the aim of investigating the literature about existing computer-assisted collaborative methods and strategies for digital inclusion of youth and adults, we conduct a systematic literature review on the theme. Findings reveal a scarcity of works tailored to adult education, especially in developing nations, even with the inclusion of Brazilian and South African knowledge repositories to broaden the scope. Collaboration emerges as a prevalent strategy, often alongside other methodologies. Notably, mobile devices are widely utilized due to their accessibility, and social networks and virtual learning environments play significant roles. However, the integration of computational thinking and artificial intelligence for digital inclusion is still in its infancy. Overall, digitally including adult learners is crucial for fostering inclusive education and enhancing opportunities for marginalized populations."
10343349,A Lightweight Web Tool to Support Feedback in Introductory Programming Practices in Brazilian Undergraduate Disciplines,"High schools and undergraduate courses present several problems regarding teaching programming. In this perspective, several factors have led to the development of tools to support programming disciplines, including: (i) the persistent problems in teaching programming worldwide, (ii) the inclusion of computational thinking and programming practices in the new Basic Education Curriculum in Brazil, (iii) the need for a lightweight virtual tool that can be freely shared and used, as many available tools charge fees, and (iv) the practical application of knowledge by licentiate degree students in Computer Science, encompassing both learning theories and software development, through the evaluation of the tool. This research aims to develop and evaluate a lightweight web tool through a case study in the context of supporting feedback for programming activities in Brazilian higher education. Additionally, the study investigates whether the feedback is considered the main problem for first-year students in computer courses from the perspective of licentiate computer science students and whether their participation in the case study can improve their skills and abilities in analyzing educational tools. A total of 16 students and three professors from four disciplines participated in the case study, with an online questionnaire as the main instrument for data collection. The analysis was performed considering the collected responses' quantitative and qualitative aspects. We obtained quantitative responses through a Likert scale, while qualitative aspects were analyzed using the Discourse Unveiling Method (UDUM). Positive aspects were identified for both professors and students, providing initial evidence of the tool's potential. Moreover, the study highlighted important feedback from undergraduate Computer Science students, which provides an opportunity to apply their knowledge technically."
9222990,Comprehension analysis considering programming thinking ability using code puzzle,"In programming education, the instructor tries to find out the learners who needs help by grasping the learners’ development of understanding using tests that require knowledge. However, in reality, not many learners will acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of current situation implies that programming ability of learners cannot be measured by tests that require knowledge. This paper focuses on not only the knowledge items required for programming but also the programming thinking (computational thinking), which is the ability to combine the constituent elements of the program. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the learner’s understanding from the learner’s process to solve the code puzzles that require programming thinking as well as knowledge. We developed the interface to realize the proposed method. The experimental result with the interface showed that the proposed method could estimate with the accuracy of 80% or more."
10343925,Examining the Realities and Nuances of ‘Low-stakes’ Interest-Driven Learning Environments,"The push to develop low-stakes and personally meaningful computer science experiences is creating novel opportunities to broaden participation in CS. These opportunities have become increasingly present across contexts and have expanded the possibilities for introducing and sustaining student participation in computing. However, while these experiences tend to be effective ways for engaging new participants and new forms of participation, we must be careful to not overlook how ’high-stakes’ these experiences might be for learners. To explore this tension, this paper describes two case studies of students engaging in coding and computational thinking with Minecraft Education Edition. The first case study involves a 7-year-old Black and Latina girl who experiences significant frustration when her computer program destroys significant portions of her project. The second is from a Latino boy who avoids using the coding capabilities in Minecraft EDU out of fear that the code might not work properly. Building on these case studies, this paper suggests that the field take steps to ensure that the language and actions associated with low-stakes and high-stakes are reflective of learner perceptions, and that we design learning experiences that appropriately reflect this nuance."

9962408,Analysis of Student Performance and Social-economic Data in Introductory Computer Science Courses at the University of Brasília,"Computer Science 1 (CS1) courses introduce undergraduate students to computational thinking and their first programming language. As in most institutions, CS1 is a challenge for students at the University of Brasilia, one of the top 10 universities in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian higher education system changed with an affirmative-action policy to admit more students from the public K-12 system: the “Quota” Law was implemented at all federal public universities. This paper aims to answer two research questions: 1) What knowledge about the positive/negative impact of certain features on the success of a CS1 course can be discovered from mining educational data augmented by social-economic information? 2) Are these features different between quota and non-quota students? The analysis uses social-economic and academic performance data of undergraduate students from 2012 to 2019. Data mining algorithms such as generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, and random forest were applied to the data. The findings include: (1) the relevance of indicators such as the consumption rate of university-subsidized meals, (2) that gender is not a determining factor in failure/success, and (3) a higher failure rate for quota students in the Computer Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering majors."

Given the Science and Technology initiatives, these topics are considered in different training cycles: primary, secondary and higher education. In the case of higher education, students must cultivate fundamental concepts for developing computer applications, which contribute to not only the knowledge of programming languages but also open guidelines for computational thinking. In previous research, we evaluated a set of platforms under a usability lens; on this occasion, we compare these results and their impact on the learning outcomes. We evaluated three experimental groups that used video game platforms to achieve their learning outcomes. Additionally, we will synthesize the literature regarding new paradigms of programming education under immersive environments."
10825962,Training in Computational Archival Science: Do CAS Educational Frameworks meet Professional Expectations?,"This paper explores the evolving landscape of training for archival professionals in the context of big data and emerging technologies. By comparing two educational frameworks—the CAS framework, developed from computational thinking research and CAS research papers, and the InterPARES framework, based on empirical studies with archivists working with AI/ML, we identify areas of alignment and divergence. While both frameworks share significant concordance, suggesting a growing consensus on integrating computing into archival work, key differences in their approaches (learning outcomes vs. competencies) and focus areas (such as work practices, systems thinking, and cybersecurity) highlight the need for further discourse among archival scholars, educators, and practitioners. These distinctions must be addressed before formalizing CAS educational frameworks. This paper also initiates efforts to integrate emerging technological competencies by bridging the CAS and InterPARES frameworks, emphasizing the value of complementary perspectives from both professional practice and academic research. We argue that such integration is essential for developing robust competency frameworks in archival education, particularly within higher education's professional programs."
10775456,Integrating AI into Biology Education: Classifying Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms Using Machine Learning,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly prevalent in various domains, its integration into education offers unique opportunities to enhance learning experiences. This paper explores the application of AI, specifically machine learning, in biology education through the classification of edible and poisonous mushrooms. Leveraging a dataset of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families, this study demonstrates how AI techniques can be used to classify species based on morphological features such as cap shape, gill attachment, and color. The use of AI not only improves students' understanding of species identification and biological classification but also introduces them to key concepts in data science, such as feature selection, model training, and validation. By implementing machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, students can engage in interactive learning experiences that merge biology with modern technological tools. The results show that integrating AI into biology curricula can foster both scientific literacy and computational thinking, offering a more comprehensive and engaging approach to science education. This paper outlines a practical framework for educators to incorporate AI in biology lessons, preparing students for future academic and career challenges in an increasingly digital world."

10892945,Six Weeks with ROSE: Teacher Perspectives on Computer Science Professional Development,"This innovative practice full paper describes a novel twofold approach to analyze the data collected during a six-week research-based summer professional development workshop for middle and high school STEM teachers in Southwest Missouri. In the fast-evolving field of Computer Science (CS), particularly within the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, the demand for a skilled workforce is increasing. To meet this demand, it is crucial to provide K-12 students with education in computing, computational thinking, and other broader Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The existing STEM curriculum could be enhanced to develop skills such as research-based problem-solving more effectively, aiming for a more comprehensive skill set among students. Therefore, empowering STEM teachers with a solid foundation of research-based problem-solving skills can significantly boost their readiness for the classroom, thus enriching their students' educational experiences. The Research Opportunity for Smart Environments (ROSE) program, a three-year initiative funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), aims to prepare middle and high school STEM teachers to effectively introduce CS concepts through innovative IoT applications in Smart Environments, including Smart Homes and Smart Classrooms. To support STEM education in rural and other underrepresented areas, a cohort of in-service teachers from rural Southwest Missouri was selected for the inaugural ROSE summer workshop. Our data collection approach included open-ended questions and effective formative assessment techniques to gather the teachers' perspectives during the initial summer session. We adopted a twofold data analysis strategy, using the qualitative coding tool MAXQDA and sentiment analysis tools Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) and TextBlob, to analyze the teachers' responses. The research questions explored the impact of the ROSE program on educators and how their experiences and outlooks influenced their engagement and professional development within the program. The findings indicate that the ROSE program has positively influenced the teachers' personal and professional growth. The teachers experienced increased confidence and knowledge in research and teaching CS concepts, despite facing various challenges, which acted as motivation for learning. Their reflections also indicated that the mentorship and resources provided by the ROSE program have promoted the development of innovative teaching methods and a shift towards a student-centered approach, showcasing the program's success in fostering the personal and professional development of teachers for the advancement of future CS and STEM professionals."

9274109,Methodological changes in teaching algorithms in the early years of the Computer Engineering course,"This Innovative Practice of a Full Paper presents new ways of teaching classes. The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline ""Algorithms and Data Structures I"" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners."

10343028,Engineering Student Perspectives of a New Required Programming Course,"In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role."
10889146,Problem Solving-Oriented Programming Knowledge Tracing from Behavior to Thought,"Programming knowledge tracing (programming KT) aims to analyze the dynamic programming states in solving problems based on historical behaviors and predict future performance. In programming, a student’s thought process can lead to multiple solutions for the same problem. However, current programming KT models attribute learners’ responses only to knowledge mastery and ability, overlooking thought factors, which creates a contradiction between data fitting and the rationalization of the model inference process. To address this, we propose a problem solving-oriented programming KT (SPKT) method that incorporates programming knowledge, computational thinking, and solving ability to improve attribution accuracy. Specifically, we designed a dual-channel attention network based on the principle of initiative gain to retrieve knowledge. Additionally, we utilized the edit tree distance algorithm to capture fine-grained trajectory representations and employed a redress mechanism with gating to update abilities based on code information. Experiments demonstrate SPKT’s superiority."

9637467,Development and Implementation of an Online Adaptive Gamification Platform for Learning Computational Thinking,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness."
9678852,"Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primary Students: Design Principles, Content Validation, and Pilot Testing","Computational Thinking (CT) is an essential skill in digital society. With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT.

The results show that the combined use of 3D virtual and physical robots in a robot programming course improves students’ Programming self-efficacy scale and learning engagement, thus improving students’ computational thinking."
10565688,Self-Efficacy to Train Computational Thinking Skills in Pre-Service Teachers*,"In this work we, study the self-efficacy of the use of the Choreographe software in block programming using the NAO robot in order to develop instructional videos in the classroom within the framework of Computational Thinking. The put forward objectives were three; (1) Evaluate the level of significance of self-efficacy and the applicability of CT concepts. (2) Measure the relationship between the applicability of CT concepts with the ease of use, usefulness, attitude and intention to work in the future with an instructional program. (3) Establish the percentages and means of the items of the variables concepts CT and self-efficacy. Thus, from a quantitative approach, we propose to create a questionnaire to measure self-efficacy and the level of knowledge acquired in block programming. 4 practical workshops of 2 hours each have been carried out with 28 initial training students between the ages of 23 and 27. The results yielded a positive correlation between the variables self-efficacy and computational thinking. Highlighting a positive acceptance of self-efficacy in the use of Choreographe software in the block programming experience and a growing ascendancy of interaction."
9286386,Enhancing Confidence in Using Computational Thinking Skills via Playing a Serious Game: A Case Study to Increase Motivation in Learning Computer Programming,"Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses."
9536372,Collaborative Game-Based Environment and Assessment Tool for Learning Computational Thinking in Primary School: A Case Study,"Computational thinking (CT) can be considered a 21st century core skill and, accordingly, it should be taught to students at an early age. Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode. The combination of different assessment methodologies&#x2014;including CT pre- and posttests, data-driven analytics, direct observation, and questionnaires&#x2014;provides assessment for each of the framework computational dimensions."
9790858,Promoting Computational Thinking Skills in Non-Computer-Science Students: Gamifying Computational Notebooks to Increase Student Engagement,"Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors."
9606871,Developing Computational Thinking Skills With Algorithm-Driven Spreadsheeting,"The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming, instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods. The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences."
9973071,A Digital Game-Based Model for Assessing Computational Thinking Skills,"Computational thinking (CT)., considered to be one of the three major scientific thinking styles of human beings., is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However., as a cross-domain competency., appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed., the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on using scales or test to measure programming proficiency and neglecting process evaluation in which CT can also be manifested. Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT. We invited 13 experts to participate in three rounds of the Delphi method and constructed a CT skills assessment model based on the digital game. The model had good consistency and was divided into four primary indicators., namely “Analysis”., “Design”., “Iteration”., and “Generalization”., which were weighted as 0.26., 0.11., 0.24., and 0.39., respectively and 14 secondary indicators. Taken together., the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating digital games in measuring CT skills in a comprehensive manner."
10844653,Integrating Computational Thinking Skills in Secondary Education: a Feasibility Study,"This feasibility study investigates the practicality of incorporating Computational Thinking (CT) education into secondary school curricula, aiming to equip students with essential 21st-century skills. The study assesses the readiness of educational institutions, teachers and students to embrace CT as an integral part of their learning journey, identifying potential challenges and barriers to successful implementation. To achieve these objectives, the research examines the existing landscape of CT education, evaluates teacher preparedness, analyses student receptiveness, and explores resource requirements and best practices from around the world. As part of this investigation, an immersive learning approach will be integrated. A five-day training program was implemented, featuring a comprehensive curriculum that covered key CT concepts, problem-solving techniques, presentation skills, and problem-based learning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. The program included pre-and post-surveys to measure students’ understanding of CT concepts and practical projects to apply their learning. Results showed consistent improvement in students’ self-reported understanding of CT skills and their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. The study reveals that integrating CT into secondary education is not only necessary but also highly beneficial. The study emphasizes that a holistic educational reform incorporating leadership, technology and curriculum adjustments is essential for the successful implementation of CT education. The study also highlights the importance of aligning CT education with current educational policies and trends, such as KSSM (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah -Secondary School Standard Curricular), which advocate for the inclusion of CT as a fundamental practice of science education. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights and recommendations for educational policymakers, administrators, and educators interested in enhancing CT skills in secondary students."
9766703,A Guide Towards a Definition of Computational Thinking in K-12,"Computational thinking (CT) has been described as a set of valuable skills for tackling complex problems. To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem."
9453926,TechCheck-K: A Measure of Computational Thinking for Kindergarten Children,"In this pilot study we created and evaluated a new version of the TechCheck Computational Thinking (CT) assessment designed specifically for kindergarten students. The original version of TechCheck was validated in first and second graders and consists of 15 multiple choice unplugged challenges drawn from six CT domains. The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument. Results of this pilot study indicate that TechCheck-K has acceptable characteristics for assessment of CT in kindergarten children."
9155816,Engaging Estonian primary school children in computational thinking through adaptive educational games: A qualitative study,"While computational thinking (CT) has been identified as one of the fundamental 21st century skills that can be applied to different domains, school students usually show negative attitude toward learning CT. Educational games have been applied by several researchers to address related issues faced for promoting CT. Even though such games have shown some success in promoting CT, they fall short when it comes to acquisition of CT skills (they rather promote abstract and conceptual knowledge) and offering adaptivity to each player. To address these issues and improve the existing games, we developed an adaptive game called AutoThinking for teaching both CT concepts and skills, engaging students with individually tailored gameplay and learning. We conducted a qualitative study aimed at understanding the cognitive and affective experiences of Estonian primary school children. The findings showed that AutoThinking is making children feel challenged, happy, and confident, while activating their thinking process during the gameplay. All children perceived the game positively and found it to be a good tool for learning."

9320743,Promoting Teaching Self-efficacy in Computational Thinking of School Teachers,"Computational Thinking (CT), one of the necessary and fundamental skills for students in the 21st century, is gaining more attention in K-12. The premise of integrating CT with other subjects is to promote school teachers with high self-efficacy in CT. Towards this, we developed a three-week Scratch online professional development(PD) course based on MIT CT framework, then implemented an online training among 84 primary and secondary school teachers from different subjects including Chinese, Mathematics, English, and Computer Science. To examine the effect of its impact on teachers' self-efficacy in CT, a quasi-experiment method of a single group pretest-posttest was conducted, and quantitative and qualitative data were collected from scales, artifacts, and interviews. The results revealed that the online PD course significantly improved teaching self-efficacy in CT of these teachers. The findings indicated that online PD integrated with MIT CT framework through block-based programming was a potential approach to effectively promote teaching self-efficacy in CT for primary and secondary school teachers."
9373147,Developing Computational Thinking for Children with Autism using a Serious Game,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of life-long conditions that are characterized by qualitative impairments in social interactions, problem solving and constructive skills. Children with learning disabilities such as autism face challenges in generating suitable and optimal solutions to problems. Those challenges can severely affect their interactions with others. Thus, teaching children with ASD problem solving and computational thinking skills could help them resolve conflicts that may happen in their everyday life. Effective problem solving is critical for their academic and social success and since one of the most effective tools for teaching children with autism is through using visual aids, the work in this paper reports the design and implementation of a serious game that aims at cultivating problem solving skills and teaching programming concepts to children with ASD. The presented game is suitable for children 7 to 14 years of age diagnosed with ASD to learn programming concepts. The preliminary prototype for the game gained positive responses from experts and 12 children with ASD from Caritas Egypt association and Hope Academy."
9273930,An Effective Approach to Teach an Introductory Computer Science Course with Computational Thinking and Flow-Chart Based Visual Programming,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience of positive outcomes with increased motivation and retention in teaching an introductory Computer Science course with Python programming. Without reinventing the wheel, we infused few well established pedagogies by integrating and evaluating Computational Thinking (CT) skills in a meaningful way. We integrated CT with existing curriculum alongside programming and teaching general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning. Our aim here is not only to teach a programming language per se, but also to teach, at the beginning, the different ways of problem solving, logical reasoning, algorithm design, and programming constructs with minimal or no emphasis on syntax. A positive learning experience is successfully developed for our students by using appropriate pedagogies and strategies. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey as well as a pre- and post-CT test were conducted on student cohort in different sections. The statistical analysis of the survey and test results show evidence of improvement in student's problem solving and coding skills as well as increase in motivation towards programming."

9764144,Understanding the Source of Confusion with Computational Thinking: A Systematic Review of Definitions,"Computational Thinking (CT) is considered a necessary 21st-century competence that should be introduced to school education as a vital ingredient. However, the lack of a consensual definition of CT and the confusion with other similar terms made it a big challenge for researchers and practitioners to understand this concept. The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions."
9272488,Supporting Teachers to Integrate Computational Thinking Equitably,"Broadening participation and increasing equity in computer science (CS) have been goals of the computing field for decades. Initiatives seeking to increase access to CS have led to an increase in elementary schools teaching computational thinking (CT), but students are often instructed by classroom teachers who have no formal training in CT or CS. Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background."
10148553,Cross-lagged Associations between Cognitive Performance and Attitudinal Beliefs of Computational Thinking: A Preliminary Study,"With the worldwide momentum of promoting computational thinking (CT) education, greater attention has been received on assessing learning effects in both cognitive and attitudinal aspects. However, the cross-lagged relations between the two were unknown. This study investigated the cross-lagged association between CT cognitive performance and attitudinal beliefs of primary students through a three-wave longitudinal design. The paper reported the first two waves of data collection, with an 8-month time interval, involving a sample of 392 students (age 9-11). At each wave, students were asked to complete a CT cognitive test and a self-reported attitude survey. Through cross-lagged analyses, the results showed that prior CT cognitive performance significantly predicted later learning attitudes, and the paths remained significant after controlling for students’ demographics and learning experiences. The study contributes to the literature by pioneering documenting the cross-lagged relations between students’ cognitive and attitudinal attainments in the context of CT education."

10025038,A Collaborative Approach to Integrate Computational Thinking in an Integrated STEM Curriculum,"This study reports a pre-college initiative that aims to integrate computational thinking (CT) in an integrated STEM learning environment in community centers' after-school programs for upper-level elementary school students. The initiative takes a collaborative approach that engages a range of stakeholders including higher institution's STEM educational researchers and disciplinary experts, a school district, three community centers and their satellite campus that serve Title I schools, and both in-service and pre-service teachers to develop and implement an integrated “STEM + CT” curriculum. The design and development of the integrated STEM+CT curriculum was guided by project-based learning (PBL) that engages students in sustained project-based activities and requires students to apply multiple STEM content knowledge and skills to solve a problem, in after-school programs where they enjoy large blocks of dedicated time to learn and practice CT and STEM. The implementation of the curriculum was led by in-service teachers in community centers' after-school programs who serve as facilitators and learners, and bring a depth of pedagogical knowledge, and who also benefit from such sustained interactions. This collaborative initiative brings relevant stakeholders together and helps build a researcher-practitioner partnership that aims to design, study, improve, and scale innovations in teaching and learning, which facilities the solving of a shared challenge of educational practice - how to integrate CT in K-12 STEM learning? - in this study. Lessons learned from the collaborative process are also discussed."
9429049,Designing Interaction and User Interface of Computational Thinking Digital Game for Children using User-Centered Design Approach,"In the 21st Century, technology has become a part of almost everyone's lives in the world and will keep on evolving. Therefore, people's way of thinking must be able to follow the technology evolution. Since 2006, Computational Thinking (CT) has been stated as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable. This application has achieved the usability and user experience goals because all the scores from the measurements using those four metrics are above the average."
9379266,Data science tools in the analysis of developing inquiry skills and computational thinking within the “IT Academy” Project,"We present our ideas how to apply modern data science technology and methodology to effectively prepare and statistically analyze large educational datasets which in our case map inquiry skills and computational thinking developed by students in primary and secondary schools at the Slovak national scale, within the project “IT Academy - Education for the 21st Century”. Combining the top two open-source data science tools, Python (within Jupyter notebooks) and R (within R studio software), we illustrate some of results from data preprocessing (cleaning, wrangling) for the diagnostic primary-school test of inquiry skills where Python tools (e.g. Pandas library) became more advantageous. As for the subsequent intensive statistical analysis, R environment was more suitable. We demonstrate summary results of the statistical analysis of the computer thinking diagnostic test for primary and secondary schools, finally cross-checked in SPSS software. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, we are still collecting data from ITA project impacts for which we finally show how we plan to implement further methods for data collecting, analysis and implementation in collaboration with our colleagues - education researchers."
9272455,Computational Thinking for STEM Teacher Leadership Training at Louisiana State University,"We developed and piloted a new course titled Computer Science Teaching Methods (CSM) in the fall semester of 2019. This course was based on materials developed from a previous program that trained high school teachers in computational thinking and programming through LSU's Cain Center. Pedagogical content knowledge informed the design of this course. Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design. The CS Methods course targeted undergraduate computer science majors who were considering a career in teaching or who were interested in CS pedagogy. We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch. The transition from the CS curriculum taught in high schools to what follows in college needs to be smoother."

Traditional teaching can no longer meet the needs of modern education, and the teaching reform of information technology courses is imperative. Therefore, this article proposes to apply gamification teaching to information technology courses to increase students’ interest in learning and cultivate students’ computational thinking, that is, the ability to use the basic concepts of computer science to solve complex problems. This article takes the secondary vocational information technology course as an example to study the specific application of gamification teaching, and proposes a case of “Gobang Game” to provide a reference for the implementation of gamification teaching."
10664997,Improving Computational Thinking Competencies in STEM Higher Education,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula."
9997660,A STEM Course for Computational Thinking Development with BEAM Robotics,"This document describes the development of a STEM course intended to improve the Computational Thinking of university students (CT). The main instructional tool for this course is the BEAM robot, a robotics paradigm that proposes simple robots whose behavior can be controlled without software programming. The programming of this robot is implicit in its morphology, so its actions and goals are codified from its construction. A three-phase curriculum is designed to achieve the objective: propaedeutic, robot assembly, and CT. On the basis of these phases, the course is constructed modularly and implemented virtually, while students receive construction kits. Each phase aims to foster the many facets of CT, such as decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Students’ responses to pre-and post-course surveys, as well as evaluation activities and logs, are analyzed to determine the course’s impact on them. In addition to other STEM disciplines (electrical, electronic, mechanical, and WEEE), the course substantially improves the CT."
10402181,Data-driven Analysis of Elementary School Students’ Computational Thinking through Scratch Projects,"The development of computer science has led to an increase in programming education for younger people. Many countries have begun programming education in elementary schools. As is a relatively new subject in elementary education, the course design and textbooks for programming education remain under development. The growth trend in computational thinking (CT) is helpful for educators to teach suitable programming concepts to students. Scratch, which is mostly used as an introductory programming language for elementary school students, can be evaluated to reflect students’ CT. In this work-in-progress research, we conducted a data-driven analysis on fourth-grade students’ CT growth in their first 3 years of programming learning by evaluating their Scratch projects. A preliminary result shows that CT grows rapidly in the first 2 years and tends to be stable in the third year. The reasons for the difference in growth of specific CT concepts are discussed."
10812249,Trying to Develop and Assess Computational Thinking in Computer Science Unplugged Activities with Gamification,"Developing computational thinking through Computer Science Unplugged activities is a fantastic way to introduce students to the core concepts of computing without the need for programming tools. These activities are interactive, engaging, and help learners build problem-solving and logical reasoning skills. CT in CS Unplugged activities involves evaluating how well the activities promote the core components of CT, which are fundamental skills in algorithmic thinking and problem-solving. This paper tries to contribute to a better understanding of the related field."
9546563,Investigating the Flipped-classroom Approach on College Students’ Computational Thinking Skills,"The study aims to examine the effectiveness of flipped-classroom instruction on college students’ computational thinking skills (CTS). Participants were enrolled in the basic computer course from two classes at a university in central China. One class as an experimental group was chosen for the flipped-classroom instruction method (n=55); the other as a control group used the traditional lecture-based instruction method (n=54). The results show that learning through the flipped-classroom approach can significantly promote students’ levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking, cooperativity, and critical thinking, compared with the traditional lecture-based instruction approach. The findings of this research suggest that instructors should be encouraged to take the flipped-classroom instruction method to teach."
10342931,Cultivating Computational Thinking through Game-Based Learning,"Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education."

9320720,Effects of integrating Collaboration Scripts into Pair Programming for Developing Computational Thinking,"Pair programming (PP) is an effective and operable approach to improve Computational Thinking (CT). However, the process of PP is complex to understand for students at the elementary level, which needs to be supported. Collaboration scripts is a promising way to structure the collaborative process through three mechanisms: pp forming mechanism, role-task mechanism, the feedback mechanism. We conducted a pilot study to examine the effectiveness of collaboration in students' use of collaboration scripts and furthermore to evaluate the development of CT and math. Both quantitative and qualitative data about the students' CT skills, mathematical achievements and perceptions of collaboration scripts were collected. The results showed that the PP with collaboration scripts can improve the CT skills, mathematical achievements; facilitate higher collaborative relationship; give students good perceptions by teacher's feedback."
9782386,Teaching of the Yupana with the Tawa Pukllay method for developing the Computational Thinking in children,"The present research aimed to assess if the teaching of the Yupana using the Tawa Pukllay method developed by Prem [16] enables to develop the computational thinking (CT) in children of 10 and 11 years old. For this purpose, a quasi-experiment with 52 children of two elementary schools located in Lima, Peru was performed. The obtained results were statistically significant showing that the experimental group, comprised with the students who were trained with the Yupana improved their CT compared to the control group, in which the students kept doing their regular activities. This highlights the fact that using this ancestral math tool could serve as an instrument to develop the CT in children."
9725170,Gamified forms: a proposal for teaching training based on Computational Thinking,"The disappointing results that Brazilian education has been showing in external evaluations by international organizations cause us concern. Technologies are here to stay and it is therefore necessary, in some way, to change this paradigm with regard to the role that the teacher plays, from consumer to producer of technological resources. And, trying to contribute to this extremely complex scenery, this paper intends to show how a proposal launched in teacher education combined aspects of gamification and computational thinking, aiming to bring another look at teaching practice, or at least, increase the pedagogical repertoire of fellow Science and Mathematics teachers who participated in the meeting promoted by the Department of Education of the city of Taubaté, in the state of São Paulo. As a proposal, a suggestion of gamified activity in the style of a game known as “escape room” was presented, using the Google Forms tool. We note that insecurity with technological tools or lack of knowledge about some features of these same tools is still a factor that causes many concerns among teachers. We concluded that reflection on ourpractice is fundamental, and, in a way, we realize that we have managed to broaden our horizons about the use of certain technological tools."

We were interested in the frequency of this phenomena, awareness and general experience of adolescents with sexting and in general in Instagram social network security regarding adolescents. Results in terms of the danger of this phenomena are clear and demonstrable: a significant amount of the teenagers came across with it. The linkage and necessity of awareness in terms of secure behaviour on the internet and relevance with computational thinking is obvious but out of scope of this work."
9453929,The influence of students’ computer science learning experience on their perception of computational thinking,"This systematic review aims to explore how students' CS learning experience influences their perception of computational thinking. We identified 21 publications in SCOPUS and coded them for comparison and synthesis. Through a meta-analysis, we found a medium effect size (g =0.656; p<; 0.001) supporting the influence of CS learning on students' change of perception of CT. Through qualitative synthesis, results show that CS learning experience influences perception of CT in terms of self-efficacy, behavioral & emotional engagement, and awareness of careers. Findings provide insights to facilitate CT education strategies and promote educational equity in the STEM field."
9201830,Sustainable C++ Education in General High School: from Teaching Programming Skills to Developing Computational Thinking,"In the age of Artificial Intelligence, the status of C++ Education Program in China's general high schools is somewhat embarrassing. On one hand, the programming training courses targeted K-12 students have been a big industry; on the other hand, the four editions of the current National High School Information Technology Curriculum textbooks are all in python. Based on the teaching experience of frontline teachers who have been teaching in general high schools for 18 years and the analysis of China's latest curriculum standards and core literacy requirements in information technology, this paper explores how general high schools can achieve sustainable C++ education program. At the curriculum level, combining the characteristics of C++ and students' developmental needs, two series of courses are formed: the General Studies Series and the Competition Series, the General Studies Series feature ""wide range of content"" and ""real problem-driven""; the Competition Series featuring ""deep"" and ""classic problems of computer science algorithms"". At the teaching level, putting ""problem understanding"", ""algorithm design"", ""algorithm experimentation and analysis"" and ""algorithm thinking communication"" at the core of teaching practice, in stages and according to the types of students, differential teaching strategies are adopted, attaching importance to the problem context design and algorithm design, and emphasizing the process of ""computational thinking"" of the students. Only based on the all-round development of students' individuality, adjusting the curriculum and teaching, can the C++ Programming Education of ordinary high school be sustainable."
10630739,Assessing Self-Efficacy Method for Enhancing Computational Thinking in Educational Game Environment,"Self-efficacy is critical for improving computational thinking in gaming. However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty."
10589985,An Empirical Study on Designing STEM+AI Teaching to Cultivate Primary School Students' Computational Thinking Perspective and Identity,"With the development of the era of artificial intelligence(AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking(CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ‘ connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students' computational identity."

9155874,Learning Chinese as a Second Language by Educational Robots Integrating the Operation of Conditional Logic in Computational Thinking and the Usage of the Causal Sentences,"This study attempted to carry out interdisciplinary learning activities which integrate computational thinking into language learning. The participants were 56 5th-grade Chinese as a Second Language (CSL) students in Singapore. The students were required to learn the ability to apply conditional complex sentences in Chinese language and learn the conditional structural logic through coding educational robots to interact with each other in Chinese. The results showed that the students improved significantly in the linguistic knowledge. Furthermore, the computer programming self-efficacy of the students has also promoted significantly in terms of logical thinking, control and debugging. The students had also shown a high level of learning engagement, low anxiety and a high intention in the robot coding activity. This study presented the empirical results of this cross-domain integration of educational robots and language learning, providing a reference and teaching practices for future teachers."
10361064,Computational Thinking and Academic Achievement: The Mediator Roles of Problem-solving Ability and Learning Anxiety,"Computational thinking (CT) has received increasing attention from educational researchers as a higher-order thinking skill. CT is a key factor that influences the learning process and facilitates the acquisition of knowledge and the improvement of students’ academic performance. However, the mechanisms of how CT affects students’ academic performance have yet to be explored in depth. Based on this, this study used a large-scale questionnaire to construct a model with problem-solving ability and learning anxiety as mediators with 8,134 Chinese elementary school students. The results showed that CT was a significant direct predictor of academic achievement; problem-solving ability and learning anxiety played significant mediator roles between CT and students’ academic achievement. CT can improve students’ problem-solving ability and reduce anxiety, which leads to better academic performance."
9790933,Development and Evaluation of Quizzes Aimed at Quantifying Computational Thinking,"Programming education will be compulsory in elementary schools in Japan from 2020, but it is still little information on how to measure the effects of lessons conducted for students. In this study, to measure objectively and quantitatively the educational effect of programming education, we developed 30 quizzes of measuring the ability of computational thinking. In this paper, focusing on the programming experience of college students and above, we confirmed the measurable ability using these quizzes."
10342946,Engineering Human Body for Systematic and Computational Thinking,"This Research to Practice Work-in-Progress paper discusses a next-generation learning system for K-12 students to educate them on scientific concepts surrounding the human body. Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system."
9148514,An Automatic Analysis Tool Based on Computational Thinking for BlockPy Programs,"BlockPy is a block-based program language which has both block-based interface and traditional text-based interface. It fills the gap between block-based programming and language coding. But there is little work that focuses on the Computational Thinking(CT) evaluation of BlockPy programs. In this paper, we design and implement a BlockPy Analysis Tool to assess the CT skills of BlockPy programs automatically. We use Python's built-in AST module to analyse each node in the abstract syntax tree(AST) of each BlockPy program. Then, considering the characteristics of Python language, we propose a new CT Evaluation Criteria based on Scratch Analysis Tool(SAT). Under the guidance of the CT Evaluation Criteria, we propose a detailed scoring program to analyze each node of the program and get the CT score. Experimental results show the superiority of our tool compared with other analysis tools."
9741843,Computational Thinking and User Interfaces: A Systematic Review,"Contribution: This document presents a systematic bibliographic review that demonstrates the need to conduct research on how the user experience impacts the development of computational thinking. Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration."
9637351,A Robotics-based Learning Environment Supporting Computational Thinking Skills — Design and Development,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of a robotics-based learning environment using an educational design research approach. Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling. Hence, the development of the learning environment and the didactic approach gained from qualitative results of interviews and observations from the first cycle of the research project are presented, providing plausible arguments for further implementing this robotics-based learning environment."

9853841,Automated Feedback and Authentic Assessment for Online Computational Thinking Tutoring Systems,"More than one third of computer science students either switch disciplines or fail the first programming class due to test/performance anxiety or learning difficulties. Personalized feedback can potentially improve both learning outcomes and retention for novice learners of computer programming. Online learning management and assessment systems have the power to allow self-paced, individualized and multi-layered learning that can be easily combined with time tested learning strategies such as pair programming, game based learning or visual programming to positively impact learning outcomes and support free-choice learning. In this paper, we introduce an online automated tutoring and assessment system, called MindReader, for introductory programming in C++. We discuss how MindReader generates personalized feedback fully automatically and prioritizes semantic error messages to avoid overwhelming the learner with a large number of signs of “failures.” We also discuss how MindReader can be used as a flexible teaching tool for introductory programming classes, and how its smart tutoring and assessment systems can improve learning."
10148486,The Role of Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction in Primary Student’s Computational Thinking Development,"Large extant studies highlighted the importance of motivation in promoting students’ CT skills. However, few of them focused on basic psychological needs satisfaction (BPNS) and behavioral engagement. Since needs satisfaction could influence intrinsic motivation and lead to better performance. It is critical to understand whether, and to what extent, the learners’ CT skills are influenced by the level of BPNS. In light of this, the work-in-progress study employed a semester-long intervention to explore the role of BPNS in students’ CT skill development. A total of 600 primary students participated in this study. The findings of this study will contribute to a better understanding of primary students’ motivation in programming learning."
10589990,The Impact of ICT Resources on Chinese Middle School Students' CT Skills: The Mediating Role of ICT Literacy,"Nowadays, the analysis of the relationship between students' ICT literacy and CT skills remains unclear, and less attention is paid to the influence of ICT resources at school on CT skills. To fill these gaps, a survey was performed on 1056 participants between the ages of 11 and 14, attending a secondary school in China. The participants completed one self-reported questionnaire about CT skills, ICT literacy, and ICT resources at school. The study revealed gender differences in CT skills based on the independent samples t-test, with boys having higher CT skills than girls. Additionally, the study found that ICT literacy mediates the relationship between ICT resources at school and CT skills. The research findings provide important insights for improving students' CT skills. Educators should pay attention to the gender differences in CT skills of male and female students and improve the acquired CT skills of female students. In addition, the improvement of students' ICT literacy skills and the improvement of ICT resources at school can also have a positive effect on students' CT skills."
9274250,Computational Thinking Growth During a First-Year Engineering Course,"This full research-track paper demonstrates growth in computational thinking in a cohort of engineering students completing their first course in engineering at a large Southwestern university in the United States. Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students."
10216563,"A MOOC on Computational Thinking for All: Pedagogical Principles, Challenges, and Their Application","For the last two decades, the world of pre-academic and academic education has been occupied with ways of developing computational thinking. Responding to the common perception to develop those thinking skills in all learners, and indeed in the entire population, we developed a MOOC on computational thinking. The course advocates the development of computational thinking skills in every human being, at any age, and in any subject matter, emphasizing the common, essential computational thinking skills: problem decomposition, abstraction, and generalization. Based on our belief in the importance of the application of computational thinking skills when using computerized environments, and the importance of its significant application in developing an understanding of any discipline, the course is based on the development of simulations of computational processes in any area of knowledge. We widely discuss the pedagogical challenges of developing a MOOC on thinking skills without teacher-learner interaction, and share how we overcame these challenges by implementing the Four Pedagogies for Developing Computational Thinking (4P4CT) framework, which integrates the pedagogies of active learning, project-based learning, product-based learning, and context-based learning. We present preliminary findings from research we conducted during the first two MOOC cycles with about 1,600 learners. Specifically, quantitative and qualitative data analysis of students' learning processes are discussed, reflecting the students' multi-faceted and deep engagement in the MOOC."
9569311,Training Methods of Computational Thinking for Medical Students in Big Data Age,"The era of big data witnesses that ‘computing’ has become an indispensable tool for medical development in many aspects of medicine domain. The ability of computational thinking is of great significance to medical students engaging in basic research and clinical diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of ‘insufficient skills and no training’ in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students’ computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively. Our practice in class shows that these training methods has positive influence in improving students computational thinking."

10345555,Inequalities in Computational Thinking Among Incoming Students in an STEM Chilean University,"While computational thinking arises as an essential skill worldwide, formal primary and secondary education in Latin America rarely incorporates mechanisms to develop it in their curricula. The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances."
9272507,Centering the Identities of Girls of Color in Computational Thinking Programs,"Efforts to broaden participation in computing have revealed the need for a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding of how girls of color form computing identities. In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective. Ultimately, we argue that centering girls' identities should be viewed as an integral part of the learning process and not tangential."
9637185,Educational Robotics Applied to Computational Thinking Development: A Systematic Mapping Study,"Educational Robotics (ER) is a tool that can favor teamwork, stimulate creativity, and the ability to solve students' problems through the process of assembling and programming robots. In this sense, ER has been used to improve educational practices. There are several initiatives that seek to stimulate Computational Thinking (CT) to stand out. Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours. Finally, LEGO® is the most used technology in class."
10398358,Leveraging ChatGPT to Enhance Computational Thinking Learning Experiences,"Given the pervasive reliance on technology in modern society, teaching Computational Thinking (CT) abilities is becoming increasingly relevant. These abilities, such as modeling and coding, have become crucial for a larger audience of students, not only those who wish to become software engineers or computer scientists. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide powerful assistance to complete computational tasks, by simplifying code generation and debugging, and potentially enhancing interactive learning. However, it is not clear if these advances make CT tasks more accessible and inclusive for all students, or if they further contribute to a digital skills divide, favoring the top students. To address this gap, we have created and evaluated a novel learning scenario for transversal CT skills that leveraged LLMs as assistants. We conducted an exploratory field study during the spring semester of 2022, to assess the effectiveness and user experience of LLM-augmented learning. Our results indicate that the usage of ChatGPT as a learning assistant improves learning outcomes. Furthermore, contrary to our predictions, the usage of ChatGPT by students does not depend on prior CT capabilities and as such does not seem to exacerbate prior inequalities."
9063433,Impact of Programming Exposure on the Development of Computational Thinking Capabilities: An Empirical Study,"Today's digital society has turned the development of students' computational thinking capabilities into a critical factor for their future success. As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim."
10508087,Scaffolding Computational Thinking With ChatGPT,"ChatGPT has received considerable attention in education, particularly in programming education because of its capabilities in automated code generation and program repairing and scoring. However, few empirical studies have investigated the use of ChatGPT to customize a learning system for scaffolding students’ computational thinking. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills. The findings of this study are expected to guide future designs of generative artificial intelligence tools embedded in intelligent learning systems to foster students’ computational thinking and programming learning."
10278231,Integrating Computational Thinking With the Curriculum of Future Professional Musicians,"The purpose of this study is to look at how a music programming course affects the development of computational thinking in undergraduate music conservatory students. In addition to teaching the fundamentals of computational thinking, music programming, and logic, the course addresses the Four C’s of education. The change in students’ attitudes toward computer and algorithmic skills, creativity, communication, and collaboration is measured using a pre- and post-test experimental design. Additionally, computational thinking abilities are assessed through the administration of music analysis, procedural, graphical, and logic quizzes, while creativity is evaluated through a qualitative grading of the students’ final music projects. Results show a general perceived improvement of the students’ attitudes toward the Four C’s as well as a good ability to convert learned computational models into musical creativity. However, more effort is needed in order to guarantee an overall improvement in the students’ actual computational thinking abilities."
9778055,Research on Teaching Effectiveness of Computational Thinking Based on Service Learning,"Computational thinking has been widely regarded as an important ability to adapt to the future. College students use the knowledge they have learned to help elementary students in the community learn computational thinking, thereby enhancing the motivation and achievement of the course. Use Scratch software tools to support the learning of computational thinking. In addition to cultivating students’ basic knowledge and abilities, it also assists the lack of learning resources in community elementary schools through practical actions of service learning, so that students can focus their learning on task-base purposes. Comprehensive research and analysis are conducted based on the evaluation of the students' completed works, the learning satisfaction scale, and the data of the key indicators of self-evaluation of computational thinking, plus the questionnaire survey of the primary school students receiving assistance. The results show that: it helps to stimulate students' desire to learn, thereby significantly improving academic performance and learning motivation. At the same time, it makes students have self-confidence and a sense of accomplishment, and makes learners aware of the inadequacy of self-learning, and promotes their willingness to learn from passive to active."
10981362,Pattern recognition in programming to support the evaluation of Computational Thinking,"Computational thinking is a high-level skill that involves both critical and creative thinking. This research proposes an advanced method for analyzing source code to assess computational thinking skills in elementary school students. We present a large-scale approach that examines source code from various programming exercises using a generalized abstract syntax tree, enabling language-independent analysis. Clustering techniques are applied to identify different levels of computational thinking development in areas such as parallelism, data representation, abstraction and decomposition, control flow, and programming structure. The results of the automated assessment provide insights into students' computational thinking abilities across diverse populations, highlighting opportunities for improving the educational framework."
10578918,Physical and Digital Twin with Computational Thinking to Foster STEM Vocations in Primary Education,"This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation."
10975898,Design and Performance Validation of a Computational Thinking Gamified Intelligent Tutoring System Focusing on Thinking Process,"Computational thinking (CT) is recognized as a crucial problem-solving skill in the age of artificial intelligence. However, there remains a significant gap in the availability of intelligent tools that effectively foster computational thinking in line with contemporary educational needs. To address this, the present study proposes a gamified intelligent tutoring system that supports learners' CT development through a process-oriented assessment methodology and targeted guidance. The assessment framework leverages machine learning algorithms to construct predictive models based on the frequency of six behavioral elements observed during gameplay, including a process-oriented failure risk assessment model for formative evaluation and a summative computational thinking level assessment model. The system identifies the critical process element contributing most to the prediction outcome to provide targeted guidance for learners at risk of failure or exhibiting low computational performance. Using a dataset of 754 real learner cases, five machine learning algorithms were compared, and multi-metric evaluation confirmed strong predictive performance, with accuracy exceeding 80%. Logistic regression was selected as the final algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability, ensuring practical applicability. The tool will enable the scaling and personalization of computational thinking development."

9962501,Introductory Engineering Courses With Computational Thinking: The Impact of Educational Privilege and Engineering Major Entry Policy on Student Pathways,This research category paper examines the impact of computational thinking within first-year engineering courses on student pathways into engineering. Computational thinking and programming appear in many introductory engineering courses. Prior work found that early computational thinking development is critical to the formation of engineers. This qualitative research paper extends the research by documenting how pre-university privileges impact first-year student trajectories into engineering through a qualitative examination of student interviews from three institutions with different processes for matriculation into engineering majors. We identify the underlying assumptions of meritocracy that are concealing the role of educational privilege in selecting which engineering students will be allowed to join the field. We provide a suggestion for how institutions can include computational thinking in introductory engineering courses with less risk of furthering the marginalization of students with few academic privileges.
9222821,Exemplifying Computational Thinking Scenarios in the Age of COVID-19: Examining the Pandemic's Effects in a Project-Based MOOC,"The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented rise in enrollments in online learning experiences among learners of all ages. In this article, we explore the impact of the global pandemic on a massive open online course, Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking, with a particular focus on the topics learners chose for their final projects. The Computational Thinking MOOC was designed using a project-based learning approach and aims to provide learners with an introduction to the “big ideas” of computational thinking using a range of case studies that encompass topics such as airport surveillance, epidemiology, and human trafficking. Beyond observing a sharp increase in enrollment and engagement at the time the pandemic began, we discuss ways in which the course's project-based pedagogy allowed learners to bring their present experiences and concerns together with the course's subject matter in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Many learners chose to address aspects of the pandemic in the course's final project and applied ideas about computational thinking to peer-graded assignments that conveyed an individualized sense of importance and urgency. We assert that this approach, along with the inclusion of a timely epidemiology case study, enabled learners to more deeply internalize the role that computational thinking can play in their own lives and in society as a whole."
9020189,Design and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Recommendation Based Augmented Reality System for Teaching Programming and Computational Thinking,"Programming is considered a skill to arouse and inspire learner's potential. Learning to program is a complex process that requires students to write grammar and instructions. The structure of a programming language does not cause impose problems to students, the real obstacle is how to apply these learned grammars and present them in a complete and correct program code for problem solving. In this study, a deep learning recommendation system was developed, which includes augmented reality (AR) technology, and learning theory, and is provided for study by students in non-major and also from different learning backgrounds. Those students divided into two groups, the students participating in the experimental group were using the AR system with deep learning recommendation and the students participating in the control group were using the AR system without deep learning recommendation. The results show that students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to learning achievement. On the other hand, in the part of computational thinking ability, students using a deep learning recommendation based AR system is significantly better than those using non-deep learning recommendation based AR system. Among the various dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are significantly different among the two groups of students. The students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to the dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills."
8093668,Exploring the Progression of Early Programmers in a Set of Computational Thinking Challenges via Clickstream Analysis,"In recent years, many initiatives have aimed to develop basic computational thinking skills. Despite the popularity of online platforms for early programmers, we still lack detailed information to analyze how these skills are acquired. In the present study we analyzed clickstream data from 3,355 participants enrolled in several Computational Thinking workshops using Kodetu, an online platform with fine grained logging features. Participants used Kodetu's coding blocks to solve challenges of increasing difficulty while we gathered their clickstream in the platform. Here, we present our findings after evaluating these data in regards of participants' characteristics (age, sex, previous knowledge), similarity with previously submitted solutions, and degree of discrepancy from the optimal solution. To facilitate collaboration with other researchers in this area, we released our dataset under an open license. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest Computational Thinking-related datasets publicly available."
9611850,A Game Development to Promote Computational Thinking,"This paper focuses on game development using Mixed Reality technology, the Magic Leap One device, by exploring with The Lab and Unreal Engine program that are developed in game interpolating Computational Thinking (CT). The research device focuses on integrating thinking skills into 3D games with real-time user interaction. From mixed reality (MR) the application of technology is evaluated in its use for learning effectiveness. The game aims to promote a computational thinking process based on the terms and conditions within 5 levels as well as the complexity of the game with more obstacles in each level as the character travels from beginning to destination. Commands provide for different contexts. Major goal is using mixed reality technology to advance convergence in computing education and training in computational thinking (CT) to help players strengthen their thinking process and CT through the game. This game can be an alternative learning medium for the educator in primary school (Grade 4–6). The assessment of target users 10–15 persons before and after the game tests have 3 aspects in technology, CT, and usability of game performance. An expert evaluation was conducted after the test. Assessment of the overall game focuses on building of CT skill within the game relative to project objectives. Evaluation results were 77.8% by users and 88.6% by the expert. Furthermore, some useful suggestions from assessment suggest adding workshop guidelines for educators or trainers. Thus, this project contributes to the computing education community by using available cutting-edge technology as an optional teaching tool in CT that suits learners in education at the primary level and looks toward future development for higher education."
9749967,Engaging Primary and Secondary School Students in Computer Science Through Computational Thinking Training,"Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training. Moreover, we can also confirm that the performance of pre-university students involving Computational Thinking skills is independent of gender, particularly at the primary education level."
9273915,Teaching Computational Thinking to a Student with Attention Deficit Through Programming,"This research-to-practice full paper deals with the difficulty that it is possible to teach computational thinking through the teaching of algorithms and programming to a person with ADD. We propose approaches to teach algorithms, knowing that it is a difficult task for many teachers. Likewise, inspiring the student's interest also has its difficulties. The Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) understands that it is fundamental and strategic for Brazil that computer content is taught in basic education. Considering the 4.0 education of a connected generation, the thinking of computer education is relevant to the construction of youth and adult education. When we include people with ADD, this challenge is not trivial. This work presents a case study carried out with a high school student who has ADD and the techniques that were used to teach him to program to maintain his interest in the area. The method used was divided into three stages: Computer Discovery (1); Introduction to computational thinking through programming (2); Learn by Doing, in line with real-world problem solving using pair programming technique and challenge-based learning strategy (3). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed strategies, an experimental case study was carried out with a student who has ADD. The student was introduced to the content and approaches for 34 weeks, totaling 204 hours. The student presented a strong indication of learning and will forever have the ability of computational thinking to program and develop their applications."
9962398,"Developing the computational thinking process in Physics courses, an empirical study for the learning of the rigid body concept in engineering students","In the present Research-to-practice Full-paper, the learning, reasoning, and problem-solving processes, in engineering students, have been analyzed from different approaches, one of them is the computational thinking process, where most of the activities must be performed as a computer does and the reasoning is developed with the well-oriented activities realized by them. In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking."
10506466,A Machine Learning-Based Adaptive Feedback System to Enhance Programming Skill Using Computational Thinking,"The solution of a typical programming task involves algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, decomposition, and abstraction skills. These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don’t consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies. It was found that such feedback was very effective and improved the CT skill deficiencies of 82% of students."
10327734,Development and Validation of the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic for Undergraduate Students,"Computational thinking is one barrier to enculturating as a professional engineer. We created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD) as an instructional tool that can identify at-risk first-year engineering students. The purpose of this study is to provide construct validity, internal consistency reliability, item characteristics, and criterion validity evidence for this diagnostic. From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach  $\alpha $  of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation. We make the case that the ECTD could contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce in engineering."
9320665,Instructional Procedure and Strategy of Primary School Programming Education Focusing on Cultivating Computational Thinking,"Based on the analysis of some famous instructional cases in programming education and in-depth interviews with primary school teachers who are engaged in programming education, this paper focuses on the instructional procedure and strategies of primary school programming education for cultivating students' computational thinking. This examination reveals the current situation and possible problems in the practice of cultivating computational thinking and provide some useful references. Continuous comparison are used to code and analyze the interview data. The article founds that the instructional procedure of cultivating computational thinking in programming education generally involves five major stages: knowledge review, new knowledge exploration, problem analysis, programming on computer, and the stage of reflection. Instructional strategies accordingly include: mind map-supported, unplugged programming, flow chart use, pair programming, log reflection, and more. Finally, the paper concludes with the problems that appeared in teaching, especially in the stage of new knowledge exploration, unplugged programming and pair-programming."

In this review, we started with reviewing theories of parental involvement. Then we investigated and categorized types of parental involvement, parent roles, and parents’ psychological factors in the parenting process. We also supplemented a new involvement form in Level 2 of Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler’s Model of Parental Involvement in CT Education, namely parents’ support with concerns about using technology and CT tools. We proposed the Model of Parental Involvement in Computational Thinking Education. We conducted comprehensive research of related studies on parental involvement in CT education and identified the research gap in involving parents in children’s CT learning."
9976359,Computational Thinking in Greek Educational System for K-12: towards the future teaching approach,"Computational thinking is considered an important skill set for 21st-century learners and became a subject of focus in K-12 education in recent years. It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. In this paper, we investigated what is the Greek Primary and Secondary School Teachers’ understanding and awareness as far as Computational Thinking is concerned. Since teachers are the agents of change, it is critical to find out how familiar and/or skilled they are with the Computational Thinking notion. Thus, we applied a qualitative questionnaire all over the whole Greek State where 406 teachers answered. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the teacher’s readiness, as well as more generic aspects according to their profile and faculty."
9470593,Exploring The Psychometric Properties of Computational Thinking Assessment in Introductory Programming,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered as the skill of 21st century. The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold."

Computational Thinking plays a potential role in cultivating Accounting students' ability to use technology to solve problems. To extend the application of computational thinking in disciplines that are not necessarily related to science and engineering, this study proposes a new theoretical framework and curriculum design to promote the infusion of CT in the Accounting curriculum."
10578701,Mastering basic Sorting Algorithms through Computational Thinking Activities for Everyone,"Sorting is an algorithmic concept that is covered in every fundamental computer science and engineering course and included in most if not all programming competitions. It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking."
10975868,Effect of Constructive 3D Virtual Simulation on Students' Creativity and Computational Thinking in Interdisciplinary Education,"Based on the C-POTE instructional design model, this study developed an interdisciplinary project-based learning curriculum on traditional archway culture using three-dimensional immersive virtual simulation to examine its effects on students' creativity and computational thinking. A total of 98 seventh-grade students participated in an 8-week controlled experiment (with one class each week). The experimental group (N=49) used the virtual simulation platform, while the control group (N=49) created projects using traditional WPS documents. The results indicate that virtual simulation technology positively influences students' creativity and computational thinking. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in the sub-dimensions of critical thinking, algorithmic thinking, and curiosity. The findings suggest that integrating three-dimensional immersive virtual simulation can effectively enhance creativity and computational thinking in interdisciplinary teaching. The study highlights the importance of adapting teaching strategies to individual student needs, offering valuable insights for future educational practices and innovative talent development."
10013445,Technological project in the development of computational thinking and problem-solving,"In the article, the authors propose technological projects to develop computational thinking following the four problem-solving phases: understanding the problem, making the plan, executing the plan, and reviewing the solution. This study was based on a quantitative approach; the participants were 37 engineering students who had just entered university; also, the Pearson correlation statistical test was used to assess the relationship between computational thinking and problem- resolve. The activities of the technological projects have been developed using technological resources, such as the Arduino board, the mBlock software, and electronic sensors. It has been shown that following the problem-solving method based on the four phases contributes to the development of computational thinking skills in engineering students who have recently entered university."
10086259,Research on blended teaching reform based on computational thinking,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted traditional teaching methods in schools, and blended teaching in the post-pandemic has gradually become a hot topic of research in higher education. Computational thinking, as one of the core literacies to be acquired in the 21st century, can help students realize the importance of computers as well as enable them to solve specific problems more effectively when facing real-life situations. The article takes the C language programming course as an example, analyzes the problems faced in teaching in the post-pandemic, introduces the concept of computational thinking and integrates it into all aspects of blended teaching design, pays attention to students' individual differences, and proposes a blended teaching model based on computational thinking and puts it into practice. The results show that this teaching model can improve students' learning performance, exercise students' computational thinking skills, and promote blended teaching reform and students' personalized development."
10063777,Educational Robotics as a Strategy to Develop Computational Thinking in Basic General Education,"This research purpose is to figure out whether educational robotics is a strategy to develop young children's computational thinking. The method used in this research was quantitative with a descriptive exploratory scope, with an inductive-deductive approach. The sample consisted of 28 students taken from the population of the tenth-grade students of “Santa Mariana de Jesús” high school. The technique used was the survey and the data collection instrument was a questionnaire at the beginning (Pre-Test) and at the end of the process (Post Test). A ""Rubric to evaluate computational thinking"" using the Likert scale was used for its tabulation, with the use of the STEAM instructional framework learning methodology, and a ""Checklist"" was used to monitor the progress of the project. The result of the data analysis showed positive increase in computational thinking skills, due to in the Post Test the students reached the scale Very well with 64%, taking into account that in the beginning (PreTest) it was 14%, concluding that educational robotics is a didactic strategy that promotes computational thinking."
10398343,Using Educational Robotics to Support Active Learning Experiences and Foster Computational Thinking Skills among Non-STEM University Students,"During the last two decades educational robotics became a popular tool for teaching STEM concepts to audiences of all levels. Yet, its use for teaching programming with university-level non-STEM audiences has not been researched so far. This work presents a new educational activity designed for teaching programming to non-STEM university-level audiences. The key aspect is a separation of teaching programming concepts and programming language and; therefore, complexity reduction in learning. The concepts are introduced using educational robotics and later on students learn how to use the concepts in the context of the Python programming language. Two teaching approaches, direct instruction and productive failure, along with a capstone challenge are deployed and their relationship to educational robotics is observed."
9637416,What Makes Computational Thinking so Troublesome?,"This Research Full Paper addresses the definition and implementation of Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12 education. CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading. We conclude by summarising the implications these questions have for the future development of K-12 curricula and teaching practices."
9272487,Teaching Computational Thinking to Multilingual Students through Inquiry-based Learning,"Central to the theory of learning are inquiry-based approaches to education. Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities."
9454003,The Impact of Physical Computing and Computational Pedagogy on Girl’s Self – Efficacy and Computational Thinking Practice,"Research studies provide some evidence that computing and education robotics have a positive impact on female students' engagement in Computational Thinking (CT) practices and their self-efficacy for CT. Other issues raised by research concern the decontextualization of computing education from the actual lives of students which causes problems for students under represented in the fields of computing and engineering, such as female students. To tackle this problem, paper aimed to develop (STEM-Computational Thinking (CT)-Computing) scenarios related to students' actual lives and their local communities in order to help female students to develop STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) competences, when core disciplinary ideas and cross-cutting concepts are infused in the scenarios. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry teaching and learning and the engineering design thinking instruction strategy using physical computing activities. A validated questionnaire for self-efficacy and CT practices was applied before and after the intervention to female prospective engineering school teachers studying at Higher Education Institutes in Greece. Results show a strong evidence for the effectiveness (enhancement of CT efficacy of female students) by using the STEM content epistemology through activities implemented with physical computing platforms."
9515660,Formalizing Problem Solving in Computational Thinking : an Ontology approach,"We introduce the idea of a symbolic description of a complex human learning task, in order to contribute to better understand how we learn. The learner is modeled on the basis of knowledge from learning sciences with the contribution of cognitive neurosciences, including machine learning formalism, in the very precise framework of a task, named #CreaCube reviewed here, related to initiation to computational thinking presented as an open-ended problem, which involves solving a problem and appealing to creativity. We target problem-solving tasks using tangible interfaces for computational thinking initiation, and describe in details how we model the task and the learner behavior in this task, including goal-driven versus stimulus-driven behavior and the learner knowledge construction. We show how formalizing these elements using an ontology offers a well-defined computational model and the possibility of inferences about model elements, analyzing and predicting the learner behavior. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving task is still at a preliminary stage, but an effective proof of concept is described in this study."
9274065,Developing Computational Thinking and Reading and Writing Skills through an Approach for Creating Games,"Research and full paper. Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area. The results of the exploratory study show that the proposed approach can favor the development of computational thinking, as well as motivate the production of texts, developing students' reading and writing skills, therefore contributing to the improvement of learning assessments."
9453903,Promoting Computational Thinking through Visual Block Programming Tools,"Computational Thinking is a competence that is developed more in the last few years. This is due to the multitude of benefits it has in the classroom. Throughout this article we show a series of activities that promote the development of Computational Thinking using tools that allow visual block programming. The particularity of these activities is that some of them were performed during the confinement due to the COVID-19 and other activities were performed later, in the period known as the new normality. Throughout the article, details are provided about the different sessions. The different visual programming tools by blocks and the educational scenarios used are also indicated. In addition, the results obtained are shown."
9998356,Activities to develop computational thinking contextualized with COVID-19 pandemic: a case study,"The development of Computational Thinking aims at empowering the individual to solve problems. It is a fundamental skill to be acquired to act in the society of the 21st century. This research is a case study that investigates the development of Computational Thinking skills, in the Remote Teaching modality, with students from the 4th and 5th year of Elementary School, in three Brazilian municipalities. The used data were obtained through an Activities Book, all unplugged and contextualized to the prevention and fight against the coronavirus, bringing content and reality closer in the pandemic moment of COVID-19. Additional qualitative data were obtained from two questionnaires that were presented together with the Activities Book to check the interest, determination and commitment. Evidence collection protocol using resources from Inferential Statistics assesses student performance, showed no difference in performance between boys and girls."
10893369,Learning Sequencing with Bee-Bot: A Study on Improving Computational Thinking and Motivation for Young Learners in Programming Education,"This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an exploratory study investigating the impact of using a Bee-Bot educational robot simulator to enhance learning sequencing concepts and student motivation among Macao primary school students. Sequencing in computational thinking (CT) is understanding and applying the logical order of steps in problem-solving processes. We introduced a Bee-Bot computer simulator for children to learn sequencing. Our study adopted a pretest-posttest method involving 35 grade two students. The Computational Thinking Test for Beginners (BCTt) was used to assess CT abilities, and the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was utilized to measure learning motivation. We found a significant improvement in sequencing ability and more advanced CT concepts (loops and conditions) and a significant correlation between those concepts. Departing from the existing literature, we delved deeper into how Bee-Bot's influence on sequencing extended to more advanced CT concepts. Moreover, considering the ARCS motivation model, this study examined how Bee-Bot affects learning motivation at the primary education level. After the intervention, the findings revealed that the students showed significantly higher learning motivation, meaning that the different learning activities using the Bee-Bot simulator positively influenced various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. The correlation between the IMMS scores and the BCTt outcomes further suggested that enhanced motivation positively correlated with better CT abilities."
9982346,A Framework to Assess Melodic Effectiveness in Training Computational Thinking to Visually Impaired People,"Computational Thinking education and training are considered crucial activities to achieve success in later challenges like computer programming. To train the brain to think in logical terms it is necessary to use adequate resources. In this paper we address the difficult problem that is assessing efficacy of a given resource to the Computation Thinking development. To discuss that topic we will use the Melodic System which is a physical learning resource capable of constructing melodic sequences in a logical manner to be used by visually impaired people. Melodic was created aiming at training Computational Thinking through music and sounds and its impact in the learning process must be evaluated. This paper presents the tests and results applied to this intent, while also providing a general and summarized presentation of the Melodic System itself."
10968634,Artificial Intelligence-Based Student Computational Thinking Analysis Model (AI-SCTAM) for Curriculum Development,"Computational thinking (CT) has been widely used to improve students' comprehension of mathematical and scientific subjects. However, there is a scarcity of information available regarding the challenges faced by students and the development of their conceptual knowledge in these learning environments, particularly in relation to the integrated curriculum. There is a need to help with course-level curriculum development to improve teaching and learning. Hence, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based student computational thinking analysis model (AI-SCTAM) to predict student engagement in learning and improve curriculum development. This research attempted to determine the association between student engagement measures using the machine learning (ML) method to determine the degrees of student involvement. The ML divides students into two groups: highly engaged and poorly engaged, according to the criteria used to measure their degree of involvement. The findings of the correlation study showed a positive association between engagement measures and performance. Analyzing the relationship between student engagement and performance will guide the development of course materials and activities. STEM education metrics based on engagement levels will be proposed to personalize students' learning experiences."
10639567,Exploratory Study of the Influence of Immersion in Games on Computational Thinking among University Students,"This study aims to explore how users’ immersion in games affects their computational thinking and problem-solving abilities and to obtain basic knowledge for applying games to health promotion and treatment. “The Japanese version of the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ-J)” was prepared to grasp the immersion of games, and “the Japanese version of the Computational Thinking (CT) Scale” was prepared to measure CT. Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills. These findings suggest the importance of considering game design elements that target specific cognitive abilities in designing game-based health promotion and treatment programs. For example, immersive game design may effectively enhance creativity and problem-solving skills. This study is expected to contribute to the development of new approaches in the field of game-based health promotion and treatment."
9766601,A Computational Thinking Course for Pre-Service Teachers,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a set of thinking processes used by computer scientists to formulate problems and describe solutions. In recent years, CT has been largely explored by the Computing Education community. Due to its potential to contribute to problem solving and analytical thinking, CT could also be a relevant subject in K-12 education. For such, there is a need to qualify educators in CT. In this paper, we describe our experience in a large-scale course on Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers. Our goal is to qualify pre-service teachers in CT, both in the comprehension of its definition and how it can be incorporated in classroom. Our experience indicates that the participants had a positive awareness of CT concepts, as well as an adequate understanding of the pedagogical approaches to teach the subject. They also developed positive attitudes towards the field of Computer Science."
10837599,Using Rubrics for Assessment and Peer Assessment of Artful Robotics Projects with the Focus on Computational Thinking,"Teaching with educational robots is increasingly being integrated into the curriculum. However, many teachers, and especially those who have been in practice for a long time have not been trained in this area. Therefore, in-service teacher training in educational robotics is now an important area. In the framework of the Erasmus FERTILE project, materials on this topic have been developed. Based on these, teacher training is being implemented in several European countries in 2024. Participants are introduced to educational robotics in combination with arts, with a particular focus on the development of computational thinking skills. In this paper, we focus on the final part of the training, in which a peer assessment using a rubric was used to evaluate the projects created. We demonstrate the inter-rater reliability of the rubric applied and use the results of the peer assessment to verify the participants' level of understanding of computational thinking."
9637141,Inspiring Computational Thinking: A Science Fair Activity,"This Research Full Paper introduces a model for structuring playful, challenge-based learning activities drawing on a process of decontextualisation of a challenge to access its Computational Thinking intellectual and conceptual components and subsequent computationalisation of these components into computational artifacts that are recontextualised to render them attractive and accessible to school pupils. The case study follows a thick description approach to evaluating the engagement potential of the instructional design, as well as the didactic choices made during implementation. We conclude that Bebras cards and Dash robots provide considerable support for a playful engagement with computational concepts and engaging children with different scientific backgrounds in Computational Thinking. In particular, flexibility in how they are used and easy adaptation of challenge level make them useful in contexts with broad participation. Additionally we find that using robots to provide a link between the theoretical presentation of CT in the Bebras card and a physical representation and programming challenge is engaging and helps participants to focus on algorithmic concepts."
10505460,Training and Practice of Computational Thinking for New Engineering Subjects,"With the development of science and technology, the talents of high-quality composite New Engineering Subjects need strong engineering practice ability, innovation ability, and international competitiveness. The college students have not only basic skills in computer operation but also certain programming skills. Those who understand and practice computational thinking will solve various non-universal computing problems encountered in work and study in the contemporary information society. In order to support the teaching objectives and educational concepts of the new engineering discipline, teaching reforms have been carried out in terms of teaching objectives, teaching content, teaching models, teaching resources, and ideological and political education. We cultivate interdisciplinary and professional integration through advanced thinking methods. It integrates knowledge points into practical engineering applications and cultivates students' computational thinking ability. It also improves the practical application and problem-solving abilities of students. In addition, we integrate ideological and political elements into the teaching process. It is a teaching method that combines moral education and professional courses."
10423693,Exploring the Potential of Modern Board Games to Support Computational Thinking,"The modern board game market (MBG) has been evolving gradually, and its mechanics appear to support concepts of Computational Thinking (CT). Seen as pedagogical resources applicable in the classroom context, this study analysed 10 MBGs with the aim of identifying aspects that can promote the development of CT, with a special focus on the modern board game 'Rossio.' Building upon the LM-TM model, an adapted version of the LM-GM model for board games, we propose a new framework that relates Computational Thinking learning mechanics (CTLM-TM) with tabletop game mechanisms."
10398325,Instilling Computational Thinking in Undergraduate Students Across Multiple Disciplines through an Adaptive Gamified e-Learning Platform,"This full paper presents the instillation of computational thinking (CT) in undergraduate students across multiple disciplines through an adaptive gamified e-learning platform. In today’s fast-paced digital age, possessing CT abilities is essential for effective critical thinking and problem-solving across various fields. To cultivate CT proficiency in students from diverse disciplines, we designed an innovative adaptive gamified e-learning platform called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ). The eight key features of CTQ are (1) interactive storyline with customizable avatars, mini-games, and questions; (2) performance profiler; (3) comprehensive question bank with questions at three difficulty levels; (4) feedback and answer to each question; (5) additional learning resources via hyperlinks; (6) badges and leaderboard; (7) progress saving feature; and (8) integrated online feedback survey. The CTQ was introduced to recently enrolled first-year undergraduate students across all five discipline clusters at Singapore Institute of Technology. The learning performance and feedback of 135 students were gathered and examined. The student population comprised 33 Business, Communication and Design (BCD); 48 Health and Social Science (HSS); and 54 Infocomm Technology (ICT) undergraduates. Statistical results from the paired Student’s t-test reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) (i) between the pre-test and post-test scores for HSS, ICT, and all students combined; (ii) between the pre-test duration and post-test duration for all three clusters and all students combined; (iii) between the self-assessed knowledge score before CTQ and after completing CTQ for all three clusters and all students combined. Moreover, majority of the students commented that the CTQ generates interest in CT, is an engaging learning platform with enriching educational content, and has motivated their independent learning. Lastly, CTQ functions as an online preparatory course aimed at reducing the diversity in academic backgrounds and varying levels of prior knowledge of computer programming languages among students. This will help smoothly transition students into programming-relevant modules, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning."
9668107,Development of CT Using Need Assessment and Gamification: A Systematic Review,"This study originates from the content synthesis of studies on computational thinking, need assessment, gamification, and computational thinking with coding from Thai and international scholarly articles published in accredited databases. Then, the synthesis results were integrated into the development of computational thinking through gamification and programming knowledge to improve the efficacy of computational learning. The process commenced with an analysis of the learners' needs obtained through the questionnaires concerning computational thinking. Data analysis illuminated the learners' levels of computational thinking as well as a fundamental understanding of what the learners need to be taught or what areas of skills each learner. With regards to this, conventional teaching approaches may not serve best to transmit the relevant knowledge which may subsequently induce unfavorable attitudes toward computational thinking. With the data elicited through the need assessment, instructors will have a clear direction as to how the pedagogical process should be designed to directly address the needs in each of the computational thinking components. In general, each component of them is rather complex, so the researcher incorporated gamification theory-based learning defined by its enjoyable game mechanisms and challenging nature which makes the coding lesson fun with block programming enabling learners to proficiently grasp the concept of computational thinking."
10534769,Analysis of Sentiment Toward Computer Science in Pre-University Education,"Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement."
9799068,A strategy to assess computational thinking,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a method of analysis and problem solving that enables the development of life skills and positively influences the social and competitive conditions of people. This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises. This paper presents the joint research between the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC) and the PRONIE MEP-FOD program of the Omar Dengo Foundation. Its objective is to automatically analyze the source code created by the students, evaluate the Computational Thinking skills they developed and compare the results with the learning objectives established in the study plans."
10402125,Facilitating Students’ Abstract and Computational Thinking Skills Using Virtual Reality,"As Virtual reality (VR) devices become more widespread, they are being recognized as efficient teaching tools for many subjects. In the 21st century, learners are expected to master important skills, which are difficult to teach in conventional lectures, such as computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and abstract reasoning. [1] Therefore, computer science or information technology courses often limit the discussion of recursion to calculating a factorial or a Fibonacci number, even though recursion is presented as an academic-type oddity in most cases. [2] To elucidate how VR can improve students’ computational thinking skills and abstract thinking associated with solving problems that require recursive algorithms, this paper examines the use of VR in computer science education to teach the abstract concept of recursion. The results of learners using VR Tower of Hanoi software are compared to those using the conventional Hanoi puzzle. Most learners show an improved understanding after experiencing the gameplay in the VR software, and some demonstrate a better understanding of recursion. In the post-survey, most participants acknowledge that the immersive environment is helpful when learning abstract subjects."
9796660,Syntax Exercises and Their Effect on Computational Thinking,"Job opportunities and the need for programmers are increasing. Companies are looking for new hires who have the ability to learn how to learn, who have computational thinking skills. Student dropout rate in computer science is the highest among college majors. Educators are striving to find a way to teach efficiently and effectively the technical and the problem solving skills students need. In this paper we will be studying the effects of syntax exercises on a subject's ability to think computationally and precisely. We tested our process on professionals and students. Half of the professionals were in the computer science field and half of our students did syntax exercises. The other half of professionals and students had no exposure to syntax to compare. Our purpose is to find if teaching students syntax exercises are still relevant and can teach both technical and computational thinking skills."
7999170,Towards Data-Driven Learning Paths to Develop Computational Thinking with Scratch,"With the introduction of computer programming in schools around the world, a myriad of guides are being published to support educators who are teaching this subject, often for the first time. Most of these books offer a learning path based on the experience of the experts who author them. In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests."
9125087,Pic2Program - an Educational Android Application Teaching Computational Thinking,"Digital tools have become more essential in education and business areas these days and it is important to start in the early stages of education, e.g. already in the preschool stage. This paper describes the development and pilot testing of an Android based serious gaming App for mobile devices called Pic2Program. The App aims to teach children the basics of Computational Thinking (CT) in a playful way. The gameplay expects the young children to steer successfully their in-game character with the help of an intuitive symbol language through a set of increasingly complex mazes. The children may even draw sets of symbols by hand thus develop a basic program. Pic2Programs image recognition module will then process these symbols by first photographing them with an Android device and then using a neural network to map the photos to program instructions. The effectivity of Pic2Program on learning CT has been evaluated by a designed course for 9th, graders. The results show that students find the App well-structured and help them to understand the basics of programming."
9321708,DWES: A Dynamic Weighted Evaluation System for Scratch based on Computational Thinking,"Scratch is a programming environment, which is widely adopted as the first language to enter the programming world. Since Scratch projects are rich in multimedia resources, it can be time-consuming to judge them by hand, requiring manual execution with the understanding of each project. Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity. Through the correlation analysis between DWES CT scores and experts’ ratings, we find that compared with Dr. Scratch, the correlation coefficient has increased."
9684681,Exploring the Balance Between Computational Thinking and Learning Motivation in Elementary Programming Education: An Empirical Study With Game-Based Learning,"Computational thinking (CT) skills are generally regarded as a basic ability for problem-solving and are gradually filtering down to younger age groups. Existing research has attempted to increase interaction and enhance the learning interest of elementary school students through block-based programming environments represented by Scratch. However, criticism suggests that this approach has potential long-term constraints on CT education. Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students’ learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment. Teachers can choose the most appropriate approach for students to find the best balance between learning efficiency and long-term interest."
9568871,Using Structural Equation Modeling to Examine the Relationship Between Preservice Teachers’ Computational Thinking Attitudes and Skills,"The growing interest of educational researchers in computational thinking (CT) has led to an expanding literature on assessments of CT skills and attitudes. However, few studies have examined whether CT attitudes influence CT skills. The present study examines the relationship between CT attitudes and CT skills for preservice teachers (PSTs). The Callysto CT test (CCTt) for Teachers was administered to  $n\,\,=$  105 PSTs to measure their CT attitudes and skills. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship of participants’ CT and problem-solving skills with their attitudes toward CT, technology, coding, and data. Findings revealed that CT attitudes predicted CT skills and provided the first step in exploring the validity and reliability of the CCTt instrument."
9637405,Examining theoretical and pedagogical foundations of computational thinking in the context of higher education,"This research paper examined theories, pedagogics, and contents explored by studies focusing on promoting computational thinking (CT) in higher education institutions (HEIs). CT has become a fundamental approach to building problem-solving skills, which requires a thought process. The field of CT is generally still maturing, and the use of CT as an approach to introduce freshmen to introductory programming courses in HEIs has been gaining scholars' interest in the recent past. To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field. Besides, the findings also create an opportunity for positioning CT in HEI's educational curriculum regarding how CT should be taught in that context."
9399606,Assessment Methods and Interventions to Develop Computational Thinking — A Literature Review,"Computational Thinking (CT) allows us to solve complex problems by expressing it in a way that computers, humans, or both, can understand. CT is closely related to problem solving and critical thinking, which are actively used in STEM education. Research on CT has gained steady momentum recently, and many of the institutions around the world have adopted CT into their curriculum. This paper presents a literature review conducted to identify the interventions used to develop CT skills and the methods used to assess CT skills. The review explored various publications on CT and identified that curriculum-based interventions and workshops are the primary interventions used for introducing CT in the educational sector. During the analysis, we have also identified a handful of assessment tools used for measuring CT skills, but they are not standardized assessment tools. Hence, we plan to analyze the existing assessment methods and propose a new sophisticated tool for evaluating CT skills as our future work."
9155152,Computational Thinking in Augmented Reality: An Investigation of Collaborative Debugging Practices,"The uniqueness of Augmented Reality (AR) is its affordance to support learning abstract concepts by rich information, visualization and the integration of user-content interaction. Research has shown that abstract idea and invisible phenomena can be learned better with the support of AR. However, high complexity and conceptual Computational Thinking (CT), such as algorithm design and related programming concepts, are rarely studied empirically in the intersection with immersive technology. This study is aimed at addressing this issue and providing a piece of quantitative and empirical evidence to AR-supported Computer Science discipline-based learning. We designed a mobile AR-enabled application based on a CT framework and related AR affordances in the literature. This app can contextualize a programming debugging task and support program editing & CT learning. A controlled laboratory study was designed and conducted. The result of statistical analyses shows that participants with the AR support made better quality of programs with lower errors and less amount of code edits, compared to those without the AR support."
10213395,Investigating the Impact of Design Thinking-Based STEAM PBL on Students’ Creativity and Computational Thinking,"Contribution: This study represents the first systematic attempt to develop Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) integrated project-based learning (PBL) as a transdisciplinary teaching method for fostering students’ creativity and computational thinking (CT) skills. Background: With the growing importance of creativity and CT skills in the modern world, there is a need for innovative teaching methods that can effectively nurture these abilities in students. This study explores the potential of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach to address this need. Intended Outcomes: The outcomes of this approach include significant improvements in various dimensions of students’ creativity (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration) and enhanced CT skills, particularly in medium and hard tasks. Application Design: The study involved 54 junior high school seventh-graders, with 28 students in the experimental group and 26 students in the comparison group. The experimental group was exposed to a semester of STEAM PBL, while the comparison group followed the regular curriculum. Findings: After a semester of STEAM PBL, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in creativity dimensions, while the comparison group showed no significant changes. In terms of CT skills, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in medium and hard tasks, whereas the comparison group did not. These results highlight the potential benefits of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach for enhancing students’ creativity and CT skills. The implications for educational practice and future research are discussed in depth."
9368459,"Exploring the Relationship Between Collaborative Discourse, Programming Actions, and Cybersecurity and Computational Thinking Knowledge","Computational thinking (CT) skills are necessary for solving the real-world problems of today and are therefore being incorporated into K-12 curricula. Cybersecurity is of similar importance; however, it can be difficult for young learners to grasp the required concepts and use them to construct meaningful algorithms. We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development. We discuss the impact of this approach on cybersecurity and CT learning and then present future directions for this work."
9954123,The Waste Separation Game to Promote Computational Thinking Through Mixed Reality Technology,"The primary issue of garbage is its direct impact on the environment and quality of life. Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game’s end. This will evaluate player’s performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting."
10423710,"OntoCnE, characterizing Learning Resources for training Computational Thinking","A Computational Thinking (CT) training program proposes a set of instruments to be used in the training, and also a set of recommendations on how to use them. To design such a program it is necessary to have a deep knowledge about the meaning of CT and its targets. Although CT skills are of paramount importance to all (since they bring numerous advantages for problem solving activities), in our context we see them as a pre-requisite for the learning of Computer Programming (CP). In order to design a CT training program supported by a rigorous framework, we decided to build an ontology that goes deeper into the underlying concepts and relates both domains, CT and CP. The outcome, OntoCnE (that stands for Ontologia para Computação na Escola in Portuguese), made clear what shall be trained in terms of reasoning to understand programming and being able to use it to solve problems using the computer. Moreover, OntoCnE also provides a clear insight on the concepts to be taught in each scholar year, as well as, on the instruments (hereafter called Learning Resources, LR) to be used in each moment for each specific purpose. This paper aims to introduce OntoCnE and demonstrates how to use it to classify LRs aiming to build a repository from where they can be picked up in a clear way. Finally, we demonstrate, through the PathIt resource, how the characterization of a concrete LR is performed in OntoCnE."
10280127,Assessment of Computational Thinking Skills: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Context In many countries, it is now important to integrate learning-oriented views to foster computational thinking (CT) in the classroom. This has inspired ideas for new lesson plans, instructional strategies, teacher guidance, and, most importantly, new approaches to grading these skills. Aim: This article presents the results of a systematic review initially focused on identifying the various ways of assessing CT in school and their relationship to relevant CT skills. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess CT in schools. This review applied a semi-automatic search for specific terms within the selected papers. These terms came from the analysis of several established definitions of CT. Results: We present a set of the most representative competencies and concepts developed in various experiences, in which the main topic is the assessment of CT, as well as some that have not been developed and that may be the subject of future works. Conclusions: The evaluation of CT in the school requires multiple approaches; it is a challenge to have a single method or strategy to evaluate everything that CT implies."
9537050,Gender Differences in Computational Thinking Skills among Malaysian’s Primary School Students using Visual Programming,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a thought process which utilize computer science concepts to solve problem in the real life. One of the methods to develop CT among the Children is by using visual programming to create computational artifacts such as animation and games. This study collected 50 animation and 47 games projects created by the primary school students in standard 6 (12-year-old) from the eight-week lesson using visual programming Scratch. The purpose of the study is to investigate if there is a significant difference between male and female students on CT skills of flow control, logic, data representation, parallelism, synchronization, user interactivity and abstraction. Source code projects were analyzed for CT skills score. Result from Mann-Whitney U test shows the different was not statistically significant between male and female students on CT skills mentioned previously."
9637221,Teachers' Perspective on Implementing Computational Thinking in Elementary Classrooms,"Computational thinking (CT) is a thought process designed to help students better solve complex problems using mental tools such as decomposition, abstraction, heuristics, data collection, algorithms, modeling, and communication (Wing, 2006). This study is part of a larger National Science Foundation funded STEM+C (computing) study that integrates CT in informal STEM learning. The informal STEM+CT curriculum resulted from the large study was guided by project-based learning (PBL) to help 4th to 6th grade students practice CT in the context of problem solving. Twenty-four teachers have worked with small groups of students in an afterschool community center program over an 8-weeks period. The larger STEM+C study also encouraged teachers in adapting the informal STEM+CT curriculum in their own classrooms, which eight of the 24 teachers have done so. This study investigates the participating teacher's perspective on implementing CT into elementary classrooms after they had facilitated the STEM+CT curriculum in community centers' after-school programs via interviewing 12 of the 24 teachers. The current study focuses on the challenges and issues regarding implementing CT in elementary classrooms. The results show that teachers collectively place the lack of time and the lack of professional development as the major obstacles in integrating CT into elementary classrooms."
10576494,Computational Thinking in Game-Based Learning for STEM Education,"Game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to enhance engagement, comprehension of course material, and academic achievements. This study aims to investigate previous studies on integrating computational thinking (CT) abilities in STEM education through GBL and propose a framework for integrating CT through the GBL framework. The proposed framework focuses on certain domains in creating mobile gaming content that facilitates the user's acquisition of knowledge about the advancement of CT in science, specifically within the STEM discipline. In addition, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to identify a specific research need. In the proposed framework, this study emphasized more that CT is implemented as an approach to attract the involvement of students in STEM education through the framework. To foster more engagement, the development of CT should consider STEM-appropriate components of the framework by optimizing software and hardware functions."
9493465,Computational Thinking Work System Method: A problem-solving method for small and medium enterprises,"Computational thinking (CT) has been dubbed as a fundamental skill for the 21st century and can be learned by all. However, little research exists on the practical use of CT in daily life. Therefore, this problem was addressed by applying a design science research approach and situational method engineering to propose an artefact that can help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the problem-solving process using CT and the Work System Method (WSM). The resulting artefact offers a systematic way of problem-solving process and allows SMEs to discover process innovation. The study has considerable implications for business owners and IS researchers. The business owner can improve the efficiency of their business process and increase the company's productivity."
10578653,Exploring the Interplay of Computational Thinking and Mathematics in Early Childhood Education: A Systematic Review,"In recent years, educational research has emphasized the significance of computational thinking (CT) and mathematics knowledge acquisition for students' learning in engineering subjects. Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field."
9690630,Research on the Educational Model of Computational Thinking Cultivation in Primary and Middle Schools Oriented to Production-Based Learning,"Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education are widely favored by schools and teachers because both of them are student-centered learning models by allowing students to collaborate and explore around issues in order to promote the development of students' learning in the 21st century. However, in practical pedagogical applications, specific educational models and implementations are highly dependent on exceptional teachers with innovative abilities, especially in the cultivation of implicit higher-order thinking of students still lacking a better landing point. In the context of the current era of rapid development of information technology, the educational changes caused by the new development of smart education mean that more attention should be paid to the level of thinking and operational skills of students. As a result, the Problem-Based Learning for Computational Thinking Development Model for Primary and Secondary Schools (CTPBL), which is interdisciplinary, contextual, innovative, experiential and humanistic in nature, has emerged. As a new educational model, CTPBL helps integrate the advantages of existing Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education, crack the dilemma of teachers' choice of the inherent educational model, and realize the cultivation of students' information literacy and the improvement of their comprehensive ability. However, it still needs to be further explored, such as its operation mechanism, technology carrier, and teachers' roles."
9766625,Towards a Conceptual Model for a Smart Open learning environment based on Computational Thinking,"Currently, there is a daily evolution of the world and our current digital society faces challenges for changing the environment. Currently, learning environments are undergoing an evolution due the increasing development of mobile technologies. Designing and implementing Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) has emerged to enhance the learning process and the creation of content. In this paper, we are interested on SLE. Our objective is to propose a new pedagogical approach to provide adaptive and personalized open learning based on Computational Thinking (CT). This contribution describes the main theoretical relationships between SLE, Open Learner Model, Open Education Resource, Open Practice and Open Pedagogy when developing SLE to promote the learning process. New pedagogical approaches, based on openness, need to be implemented. The goal is to orchestrate between different features of SLE in order to propose a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). We focus in particular on the pedagogical scenario that will be deployed in a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). The proposed scenario is promoted by Smart Open Pedagogy to enhance CT. We aim to deliver open assessment adapted to specific learner context profile, progress and CT’s Level in the learning."
10423685,Neuroeducation: Guidelines for Computational Thinking training,"Computational Thinking (CT) skills are a key competency for all citizens, but for Computer Programming students these abilities are crucial. Several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the CT skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. For that purpose, Teachers responsible for the children’s education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training CT skills. There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process. Currently, Educational Neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. This important knowledge about the brain’s learning process can be turned into principles applicable in Education. This paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. Based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative CT training. Neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. The guidelines inspired by Neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in LR, in order to promote more effective training. One concrete LR for primary school, created by our Master’s Students in Computing Education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal."
9620553,A Typology of Models for Integrating Computational Thinking in Science (CT+S),"In order to expand opportunities to learn computer science (CS), there is a growing push for inclusion of CS concepts and practices, such as computational thinking (CT), in required subjects like science. Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms."
9744486,The Effect on Computational Thinking Using SRA-Programming: Anticipating Changes in a Dynamic Problem Environment,"This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT."
9272483,Examining Teacher Perspectives on Computational Thinking in K-12 Classrooms,"This paper examines K-12 teacher perspectives on the promise and challenges of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education for all students across three states and three school districts-one rural, one suburban, and one urban. Through a series of teacher survey and focus groups, this exploratory research presents the perspectives of K-12 teachers across three distinct vantage points: First, to what degree do these teachers see a clear value as to why CS and CT matter to their students' learning? Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/ CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design. Discussion section points to how these preliminary surveys and focus groups with teachers offer an early predictor in terms of how each district develops its own K-12 computing pathway, with the expectation that such focus groups offer a powerful research/ evaluation protocol that can be repeated annually among districts to gauge to what extent teachers' hope (and concerns) about comprehensive K-12 computing pathways are warranted."

Utilizing Python programming and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) package, this study proposes a curriculum structure that encompasses drone control and AI-based image recognition. The program primarily aims to develop students’ computational thinking and AI literacy, foster integrated project-based learning, and enhance problem-solving abilities."
10148299,The Future Nexus of Computational Thinking Education: A Preliminary Systematic Review of Reviews,"Recent years have seen a high volume of computational thinking (CT) review studies. However, there have been no existing studies that map these reviews with the goal of achieving comprehensive understanding of the field of CT. This paper utilizes Tikva & Tambouris’ (2021) K-12 CT research domain conceptual model as the basis for identifying and defining CT reviews, then maps the identified 38 CT reviews onto the identified domains. We pinpoint eight potential future review topics, including ""communities"" of tools, ""modeling simulations,"" ""problem-solving"" and ""scaffolding"" of learning strategies, ""demographic attributes"" of factors, ""practices"" and ""perspectives"" of the knowledge-based areas, and the ""teacher training"" of capacity building. We also examine the topical keywords of the reviews and identify that the scope of the term ""unplugged"" is vaguely defined among the existing research, suggesting a need to refine the definition of this frequently discussed topic so as to be able to more effectively conduct supplementary reviews. Our results help to better understand the CT review field and formulate future directions."
10496935,A Method for Assigning Weight to the Assessment Indicators of Computational Thinking with XGBoost,"Computational thinking (CT) assessment indicator assignment is an important strategy for optimizing assessment and an effective method for exploring differences in the importance of assessment indicators. However, the objectivity of the previous methods for assigning assessment indicators of CT is insufficient. Therefore, the paper proposed to use the XGBoost machine learning model to fit the assessment data, fully explore the data features and realize the weighting of CT assessment indicators. The CT assessment indicators are used as the features of XGBoost model training and the assessment levels are used as the training labels to obtain the feature weights through XGBoost model training. The feature weights are used as the CT assessment indicator weights to realize the weighting of assessment indicators of CT in reverse. From the analysis of the CT assessment indicator assignment results, the analysis of the importance of the assessment indicators and the comparative analysis of the assessment results before and after the indicator assignment, it is found that the CT assessment after the indicator assignment has higher robustness and credibility."
10613367,Sucre4Stem: A K-12 Educational Tool for Integrating Computational Thinking and Programming Across Multidisciplinary Disciplines,"This article discusses the latest developments of the Sucre4Stem tool, as part of the Sucre initiative, which aims to promote interest in computational thinking and programming skills in K-12 students. The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the “programming to learn” approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of “learning to program” in isolation."
10398308,Computational Thinking Activities in High Schools to Enhance Interest and Skills in Programming,"While programming has been recognized as an engaging way to enhance students’ learning, implementing programming in K-12 education remains challenging, particularly when it requires access to digital devices or the internet. Therefore, it’s essential to consider more accessible methods for teaching crucial programming skills. Given this situation, we turned to unplugged computational thinking (CT) activities to foster interest and develop skills in programming. By introducing programming concepts through unplugged CT activities, this research significantly contributed to the growth of interest and the development of skills among secondary school students. Two hundred and thirty lower secondary school students volunteered to participate in the intervention using a designed unplugged CT activity framework. The CT activities framework consists of four components: puzzles, the Bebras Computing Challenge, problem-solving, and programming concepts. Four schools participated in three- to four-day interventions for four to five hours daily. Quantitative data collection was performed using pre- and post-surveys before and after the intervention phase. A paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated the p-value < 0.05 suggested a significant improvement in interest and programming skills. An overall findings implied that the unplugged CT activities enhanced students’ understanding of CT as well as improved their interest and programming skills."
10386409,Introducing Computational Thinking in Middle-Schools using a Culturally-responsive Game through a Researcher-Practitioner Partnership,"There is a national need to increase the number of minority students entering STEM fields with essential computing skills. To increase minority students’ interest and engagement in computing, a researcher-practitioner partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the El Paso Independent School District, developed and implemented a culturally and linguistically responsive curriculum and pedagogy to introduce computational thinking (CT) in two middle schools across different subject areas in a borderland region. The curriculum leveraged the Sol y Agua game – a bilingual, culturally-responsive game designed to engage students of this region in CT. This paper describes the process and initial findings of this project. The quantitative data from in-game analyses show that students utilized the language change feature to switch from English to Spanish more frequently than the other way – highlighting the need for educational platforms relatable to students through language, environment, and cultural context. Analyses of the qualitative data indicate that while teachers/team members understood CT and translanguaging concepts and taught lesson units that provided opportunities to practice both, CT and translanguaging were largely implicit in the curriculum. In collaborative analyses of these patterns, teachers described additional supports that would help them to make CT instruction and translanguaging strategies more explicit in the content and pedagogy, highlighting the need for systematic, targeted integration of these concepts."
10959898,Computational Thinking in Asia-Pacific K-12 STEAM Education: A Systematic Review,"The interest in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education has been growing around the world, which allows the integration of diverse disciplines. Also, computational thinking (CT) is considered as part of the essential skills needed in the 21st century. This review aims to investigate the current state of K-12 STEAM education to develop CT skills, in the context of the Asia-Pacific region and provide examples of best practices. A total of 25 articles met the inclusion criteria for the review, they were published from 2019 to 2023, and employed learning activities developed at preschool, primary and secondary levels.

10470788,"Nanotechnology as a Tool for Computational Thinking Skills using Open Hardware, Embedded Systems and Repository Platform, in Industry 4.0 Era","The advancement in Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) technology resulted in accurate and high-performance miniature device systems. These devices are so tiny that they are not noticeable by the human eye and exhibit excellent feasibility in miniaturization sensors due to their small dimensions, low power consumption, and superior performance. The area of sci-ence and engineering where MEMS are developed (dimensions in the manometer scale) is called Nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is one of the fastest growing scientific research related to Industry 4.0. Nanotechnology may introduce industrial skills deficits as well as opportunities for new teaching practices in several subjects and educational frameworks. In the present work, we investigate the attitude of STEM (i.e. technology/engineering) and non STEM - related instructors, regarding the integration of Nanotechnology applications in Higher education curricula. Their opinions, concerning the applied teaching method, the learning content material and expected student skills, should always be taken in to account, as they may boost any reformations proposed. Moreover, we propose a repository platform, with which instructors may interact with 3D designs and MEMs mate-rial to built their didactic plans. This work's findings is critical for the design and innovative training material and computational thinking (CT) activities, which will prepare student with skills related to Industry 4.0 demand."
10107885,A Computational Thinking Assessment Tool on Text- Based Programming,"The assessment of computational thinking (CT) skills based on text-based programming is a necessary part of the implementation of CT education in higher education. However, the current research on CT assessment is mostly single-approach, which is not effective in accurately measuring numerous competencies of CT skills and has the disadvantage of assessment limitation. In order to solve the problem of assessment limitations, this paper defines the content of CT evaluation from the perspective of text-based programming and constructs a multidimensional test method. Different test schemes are selected according to the characteristics of CT skills, and assessment tools are developed by combining the question test, programming test and scale survey, and the assessment tools are used to evaluate and analyze learners' CT skills from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The results show that the evaluation indicators and test questions designed on text-based programming are more consistent with the evaluation objectives. And the approach of evaluating CT skills from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives can reflect learners' CT skills more comprehensively and accurately."

Four educators share their teaching strategies aimed at modernizing the way digital LIS and computational education are conducted. Their goal is to create an active and engaged community of future archival practitioners, ready to tackle the digital records and archives future."
10125266,Quantum Serious Games to Boost Quantum Literacy within Computational Thinking 2.0 Framework,"Quantum mechanics is a revolutionary scientific field, which lies at the crossroad section of Physics, Mathematics, Computer and Computational Science. In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry-based learning using Python libraries."
9900775,Efficacy of a ‘Misconceiving’ Robot to Improve Computational Thinking in a Collaborative Problem Solving Activity: A Pilot Study,"Robot-mediated learning activities are often designed as collaborative exercises where children work together to achieve the activity objectives. Although miscommunications and misunderstandings occur frequently, humans, unlike robots, are very good at overcoming them and converging to a shared solution. With the aim of equipping a robot with these abilities and exploring its effects, in this article we investigate how a humanoid robot can collaborate with a human learner to construct a shared solution to a problem via suggesting actions and (dis)agreeing with each other. Concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. Furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. Via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. The results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms."
10604485,A Systematic Approach to Catalogue Learning Resources that Promote Computational Thinking,"Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children."

10013387,Technological tool to assess computational thinking,"The educational challenges of society permeated by digital technologies are aimed at developing skills to identify and solve environment problems. In this context, computational thinking (CT) emerges as a set of skills to be developed from an early age, which requires the empowerment of programming and demands the use of technological tools. The purpose of this article is to present the design and implementation process of a computer tool for CT evaluation, as well as its validation with a sample of elementary school students from a public institution in Colombia. The methodology focuses on the phases of the SCRUM development process. The results show that women perceive less difficulty in understanding the activities to be solved. It is possible to obtain a web application type software taking into account the evaluated characteristics of the tools used for CT teaching, covering most of these, and with special emphasis on some such as the content in Spanish, instructional model, management of the course, learning activities, monitoring, feedback and gamification."
10578887,Teachers' Intention to Integrate Computational Thinking Skills in Higher Education: A Survey Study in the Netherlands,"Computational Thinking (CT) is vital in today's digital era, especially in Engineering Education. While no official policy or teaching framework on CT education has been established in the Netherlands, a Western European country, there have been various initiatives for the integration of CT into the curriculum. Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS. Additionally, there is a call for further exploration of how to enhance teachers' performance expectancy and effort expectancy."
10402296,Problem Based Gamification to Enhance Quantum Literacy within Computational Thinking 2.0 Framework,"Quantum mechanics is a fundamental, axiom-based physical theory that describes and explains phenomena that Classical Mechanics and Electrodynamics are unable to describe. It is considered a cross disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which focuses on nature’s real complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of computing skills acquisition, through problem-based activities to offer powerful knowledge to a wide group of learners. Therefore, quantum technology knowledge should be accessible to students and teachers, in a more interactive way. In this paper, we propose contemporary and Problem based scenarios, in which students may acquire stronger mathematical, computational and modelling skills, working as real researchers. Thus, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to quantum principles, such as superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games we propose, relate to strategic games, within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. Certain Python libraries and packages are used and the didactic approach is based on game-based inquiry learning."
10216466,Teacher Practices for Computational Thinking Implementation in Elementary Science,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key component of computer science and a foundational thinking process in K-12 classrooms. CT can be easily integrated into science lessons with the right policies, programs, and practices in place. This paper explores the current practices of CT in a northeast US state based on survey data collected from teachers. The research uncovers how much teaching time is spent teaching science and the percentage of lessons that have CT concepts and approaches present in the science instruction while describing what these lessons look like. This paper then discusses the next steps for implementation efforts based on the described CT practices in elementary science."
10893070,WIP: Mechanisms of Change - A Mixed-Methods Analysis of the Outcomes of a Computational Thinking Professional Development Program,"This work-in-progress research paper reflects on findings from a program evaluation of a nationwide professional development (PD) initiative designed to enhance computational thinking (CT) skills among teachers in Colombia's public schools. Evaluating CT education programs presents challenges due to the limited research on the validity and reliability of data collection tools. In addition, evaluation of PD programs in CT often overlooks affective factors and fails to align with program outcomes beyond the training context, leading to insufficient evidence of their effectiveness. This study seeks to identify the factors that influence the effective implementation of CT teaching practices and contribute to the body of knowledge of professional development programs. Using a sequential mixed-methods approach, we first conducted pre-post surveys to assess changes in teachers' knowledge, followed by realist-based focus group discussions to gain deeper insights into participants' experiences and the factors influencing classroom implementation. The primary contribution of this paper is providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving changes in teachers' practices after participating in a CT-focused PD program in a middle-income country. Preliminary results indicate significant improvements in teachers' CT knowledge post-intervention. Qualitative findings highlight the importance of teachers' confidence in their CT knowledge and the need for comprehensive school support for effective CT integration."
10436103,Modeling a Problem-Solving Approach Through Computational Thinking for Teaching Programming,"Contribution: A problem-solving approach (PSA) model derived from major computational thinking (CT) concepts. This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops. The analysis of the posttest further confirmed that the experimental groups (PBL and GBL) exhibited significant difference in the scores compared to the control group. However, the posttest results did not differ significantly between the experimental groups (PBL and GBL)."
10676315,Constructing a Computational Thinking Evaluation Framework for Pupils,"Research Purpose and Contribution: The study aimed to construct an evaluation framework for assessing pupils’ computational thinking (CT) during classroom learning problem solving. As a self-report evaluation scale for pupils, this evaluation framework further enriched the CT assessment instruments for pupils and provided a specialized instrument for experts to evaluate pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations during classroom learning. Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages. However, few studies have focused on the specific context from the perspective of practice for pupils. Thus, the evaluation framework of pupils’ CT is worth exploring. Intended Outcomes: A CT evaluation framework for evaluating pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations in classroom learning was constructed to facilitate researchers’ understanding of pupils’ CT levels and problem-solving skills. Application Design: In this study, data from 897 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades were collected using an online questionnaire that included 27 items about CT. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item analysis were conducted to analyze the data in this study, with 17 items remaining in the final evaluation framework. Findings: The fitting validity, convergence validity, and discriminant validity all met the recommended criteria, which showed that the evaluation framework was effective. The total reliability of CT was 0.911, indicating that the consistency and reliability of the evaluation framework constructed in this study were satisfied."
10893178,WIP: Professional Learning in Computational Thinking for Early Childhood Teachers in Latin America,"This research to practice work in progress paper explores changes in teachers' knowledge of integrating computational thinking (CT) into early childhood education in a professional learning (PL) initiative. The main goal of the program is to prepare teachers to develop CT practices into early childhood learning environments by fostering several key components: recognizing the significance of CT development from early childhood, applying pedagogical practices (i.e. unplugged activities, Use-Modify-Create), identifying socially constructed roles and stereotypes surrounding toys, implications of screen and device usage in learning, and developing skills to design CT learning activities tailored for their own classroom settings. To achieve our goals, the research team designed, implemented, and evaluated an online 30-hour PL program with educators from Latin American countries. Approximately 80 teachers completed the online PL program. The participating teachers engaged with the PL program weekly by providing written journal reflections. In the final week, they were asked to design a lesson based on what they learned and implement it into their classroom. Teachers completed a pre- and post-survey surrounding their self-efficacy and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) in CT. Data sources include pre- and post-surveys, teacher journal reflections, and lesson plans developed by teachers. In this paper, we analyzed their journal reflections to qualitatively develop an understanding of how teachers progressed in the PL. The lesson plans will be analyzed to identify: (1) the learning goals for the students, (2) which activities teachers preferred to implement, and (3) how they assessed student learning in CT in their classroom. Preliminary findings demonstrate the types of CT activities they implemented in their classrooms. Teachers also created lessons that met their students' needs which further provides examples of how CT is integrated within the existing curriculum surrounding student interest and culture. Many PL programs often teach about CT concepts, but do not offer a chance to implement a lesson plan and reflect on their experience. This process helps teachers develop self-efficacy for teaching CT in an elementary classroom and teachers reported that they would continue to integrate CT within their future instruction. Also, this program contributes to the reduction of the gender gap in CT, promoting equitable practices in early childhood education."
9962505,When Does Collaborative Interaction Support Learning of Computational Thinking Among Undergraduate Students,"Collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding."
10664854,Game-Based Assessment for Computational Thinking: A Systematic Review,"Computational thinking (CT) has become an indispensable skill in the 21st century and has permeated into K-12 education at all levels. The evaluation of CT has become a crucial concern for educators and researchers. Currently., while extensive research has investigated the assessment of students' CT conceptual understanding., the measurement of their thinking processes is less involved. The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games. Different ways for assessing CT skills in games were identified, involving progression level, log data, and manual coding. The benefits of CT game-based assessments were broadly reported, such as enjoyable experiences for students, instant feedback, easy administration for teachers and researchers, and richer information on students' cognitive processes. However, limited has been done in exploring the use of digital games for younger age groups, and the psychometric qualities of the tools were hardly reported in the reviewed studies. The study sheds light on the research and teaching practices in using games and interactive assessment platforms in CT education."
10487240,Promoting K-12 Computer Science Education : A Computational Thinking Partnership Project,"This paper describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) Education among pre-service and in-service teachers as well as Teacher Preparation Faculty. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers and 9 Education faculty members from three schools participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework [1] and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to develop CS/CT knowledge, understanding, skills and application among participants. In phase one of the project, pre-service and in-service teachers explored CS educational hard/software platforms and used open-source sites such as Sphero Edu, Wonder Workshop, Scratch and Code.org. They envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms, and they worked collaboratively to design a problem-based project for their own students. In phase two of the project, teacher preparation faculty were trained to integrate CS and CT into several preservice courses as well as build into the coursework sequence meaningful experiences that would expose future teachers to CS and CT knowledge and skills so that they could then incorporate these into their own K-8 lesson plans. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge. The feedback from the participants shows positive results."
10767671,FAST DELIVERY: An Educational Video Game for Developing Computational Thinking Skills,"Fast Delivery is an educational game designed to facilitate the learning of computational thinking and development of logic, teaching the basic pillars that would be sentences, conditionals and cycles through an entertaining and innovative tool. Fast Delivery facilitates the resolution of programs because it is written in a textual programming language through a simple and intuitive pseudocode in the Spanish language. The game employs a gamified approach where users answer coding questions displayed on the screen by selecting code fragments from boxes to complete the given code. Using various associated techniques, such as gamification mechanics that will be lives and scores. And also the behavioral instruction technique that will work through visual and auditory stimuli. To evaluate the effects of the game use on learning and motivation, a study was carried out with students from a Chilean educational school. The results show that some students presented an overall learning gain, while others performed worse in the posttest than in the pretest. A motivational questionnaire based in the Self-determination Theory, supports the idea that students perceived the activity as difficult, lowering their sense of autonomy and competence, raising pressure, and thus negatively affecting motivation. Results by learning objective suggest that higher learnings were obtained for decision structures rather than for cycles and arithmetic operations with variables."
9620608,Computational thinking in elementary classrooms: Using classroom dialogue to measure equitable participation,"The increased push for access to computer science (CS) at the K-12 level has been argued as a way to broaden participation in computing. At the elementary level, computational thinking (CT) has been used as a framework for bringing CS ideas into the classroom and educating teachers about how they can integrate CT into their daily instruction. A number of these projects have made equity a central goal of their work by working in schools with diverse racial, linguistic, and economic diversity. However, we know little about whether and how teachers equitably engage students in CT during their classroom instruction-particularly during science and math lessons. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing classroom instructional videos using the EQUIP tool (https://www.equip.ninja/). The purpose of this tool is to examine the quantity and quality of students' contributions during CT-integrated math and science lessons and how it differs based on demographic markers. We highlight this approach using classroom video observation from four teachers and discuss future work in this area."
9139348,Unplugged Teaching Activities to Promote Computational Thinking Skills in Primary and Adults From a Gender Perspective,"Several investigations state the low participation of women in the world of STEM. This fact implies a lack of feminine perspective in the solution to different problems. The school must provide teaching / learning strategies for the integration, empowerment, and active participation from early ages to work performance in STEM. This paper exposes two unplugged activities taken from a series of activities implemented with elementary students and families in Madrid, Spain. The general objectives are: To introduce and motivate interest from an early age in computer programming and the development of gender dynamics that educate about gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in this context."
9870296,Double-Assimilation of Prosperity and Destruction Oriented Improved Imperialist Competitive Algorithm with Computational Thinking,"Whereas the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) shows limited global search ability and be liable to be trapped into local optimum, a double-assimilation of prosperity and destruction oriented improved imperialist competitive algorithm (DPDO-IIC A) is proposed tentatively to overcome inherent defects. The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA."
10397736,Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology Against Unplugged Computational Thinking Activities,"Occasionally, there may be a low impact on learning engagement between teachers and students due to, for example, poor internet connection or simply because students have lost their focus. One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach."
9637142,An Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic: A Psychometric Analysis,"This research-track work-in-progress paper contributes to engineering education by documenting progress in developing a new standard Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic to measure engineering student success in five factors of computational thinking. Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession. Currently, the diagnostic identifies general computational thinking skill"
10807249,Using RoblockLLy in the Classroom: Bridging the Gap in Computer Science Education Through Robotics Simulation,"RoblockLLy is an educational robotics simulator designed for primary and secondary school students, whose goal is to increase their interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In the particular case of computer science, it allows developing computational thinking skills. It has been designed with ease of use in mind. This free tool is available through a web browser and does not need a complex installation or specific hardware requirements, allowing educational robotics to be introduced to a wide range of users by working on practical projects that will help them understand key concepts of robotics and programming. The effectiveness of RoblockLLy has been validated based on motivation, usability, and user experience criteria. The tool was validated with 212 secondary school students (12–16 years old). Specifically, motivation was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, usability with the System Usability Scale, and user experience with the User Experience Questionnaire. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that students perceived RoblockLLy as a novel and interesting tool. The ratings for usability were predominantly positive, although a few students indicated a preference for expert assistance. The overall rating of the user experience was positive as well, yet notable differences in attitudes toward motivation and usability were observed between genders."
9360590,Analyzing Students’ Computational Thinking Practices in a First-Year Engineering Course,"This study investigates the relationship between two related computational thinking practices: data practices and computational problem-solving practices in acquiring related computational thinking practices during a first-year undergraduate engineering course. While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups. These findings suggest that previous knowledge or exposure to different practices can result in different progressions of more complex computational practices, emphasizing the relevance of troubleshooting and debugging as a practice required for a successful and timely progression on the acquisition of other computational thinking practices."
10124008,Bridging K–12 Mathematics and Computational Thinking in the Scratch Community: Implications Drawn From a Creative Learning Context,"This study analyzes 15,453 math topic-based Scratch projects of the online Scratch community to find the relations among K–12 math topics, usage of 13 programming elements, and project popularity. Among the six math topics, only statistics and calculus significantly contribute to projecting popularity. In addition, noncore programming elements, including sound and look, are widely adapted across various math topics and contribute significantly to project popularity. Although some studies discussed the integration of computation thinking (CT) and math in the classrooms, scant research focuses on the effect of math topics on CT element adoption for achieving better integration in the creative learning context. Moreover, few studies involve a large sample size for generalizable findings."
9155556,Development of Computational Thinking Education System for Elementary School Class,"This paper describes a new programming education method using stickers and a scanner that combine the features of unplugged programming and physical programming.

9676097,Design of Java Interactive System Pattern based on Computational Thinking,"With the increasing complexity of data types, the workload of software development is also increasing, and the later maintenance of software becomes very difficult. According to statistics, the vulnerability related to complex data processing occupies a large proportion of software vulnerabilities. The existence of software vulnerability makes the software system vulnerable to attack and affects the reliability of the software system. In this paper, the upper computer system uses the HashMap structure to store the query data directly in the structure and reduce the mapping process from data to table objects. After that, the rationality of the system module is analyzed by building a complex network model, and the robustness of the system is improved by finding the key nodes."
10605616,On the Issue of Developing Computational Thinking When Teaching Students in the Field of Study Applied Mathematics and Computer Science,"The goal of modern educational systems is to prepare not just a performer, but a creatively developed personality capable of solving non-standard problems in the changing conditions of professional activity. A higher educational institution requires the introduction of new approaches to teaching that ensure the development of professional, creative, information, and communicative competencies of graduates. The article presents the discipline “Numerical Methods” and “Theory of Computational Experiments”, which are basic for students in the field of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. The knowledge, skills and abilities obtained while studying the discipline will make it possible to carry out applied projects in the field of mathematics, natural sciences, operations research, and machine learning. These disciplines can also be recommended to students in the areas of training Applied Informatics and Mathematical Support of Information Systems due to the importance of mastering this material and subsequent use in solving applied problems."
9620585,Making a Case for Studying the Effects of Using GitHub on HBCU Students' Computational Thinking Skills,"While preparing students for careers beyond graduation, HBCU faculty often have to balance the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness as influenced by industry and discipline standards. Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms."
10040862,"Computational Thinking, a Discipline to Enhance Digital Skills Such as Programming","This document presents the results of the development of a learning program on computational thinking through programming challenges with robots oriented to early childhood. The methodological approach used was quantitative, using a quasi-experimental design, taking pretest/posttest measures, with experimental and control groups. The sample of participating students was 46. They belonged to a group of first grade of primary education, aged between 6 and 7 years, in a Spanish educational center. The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the “TangibleK” robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group. Therefore, we can statistically attribute the mastery of computational thinking skills to the participation in the training activities."
9118395,Utilizing a Data analytics project to increase student awareness of contemporary global issues,"Computational thinking is irrefutably a must-have skill in today's digital world. This is why it is a requisite course in most college curricula. Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning."
10975239,Designing a high school computational thinking test using evidence-centered design,"The development of computational thinking as a cognitive skill is crucial in the digital age. However, there remains no consensus on its definition or measurement. This study aims to address this gap by developing an instrument to estimate the level of computational thinking using an evidence-centered design approach. The proposed framework integrates cognitive theory, educational research, and psychometric modeling to create a comprehensive and reliable assessment tool. The instrument consists of two scenarios with a total of 59 items divided into six questions. It was validated by experts in the field, achieving a content validity index of 0.76. The test was administered to a sample of 100 students from three secondary schools in Lima, Peru, and analyzed using Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis and parametric tests. The results indicate that the model effectively assesses algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, and problem solving skills, regardless of prior programming experience. However, the assessment of creativity requires further refinement. This research contributes to evidence-based educational policy and practice in secondary education, offering a foundation for future improvements in the evaluation of computational thinking."
9281177,Analysis on the incorporation of technologies with a pedagogical perspective,"This work is the result of an investigation carried out within the framework of a research grant. The work experience that this team carried out was aimed at describing and systematizing the configuration of computational thinking, its incidence and validity in the educational field from the analysis of public policies, from an interdisciplinary approach. The experience carried out was developed based on a bibliographic and documentary analysis work, which allowed recovering the concept of computational thinking to analyze it in conjunction with the development of critical pedagogical practice and the concept of competences. Here an analysis of some of the current debates presented by computational thinking and its teaching is presented in order to promote a line of dialogue and problematization between what was done, is done and is projected on this subject."
10513387,Design and Application of a Game Activity-Based Unplugged Programming Curriculum for Elementary Schools,"A series of unplugged programming courses based on game activities has been designed and developed to reduce the difficulty of programming courses in elementary school and to develop computational thinking skills in elementary school students. Four components were designed for the course: course objectives, course content, course activities, and course evaluation. A controlled experiment was performed to validate the course's influence on developing learners' computational thinking, and a questionnaire was employed to examine the experimental class learners' experience with the course. The results found that the level of computational thinking in the experimental class was also significantly different from the pretest, and the students in the experimental class rated each item of the course above 7 points. This indicates that this course has a significant effect on cultivating students' computational thinking, and the learners had a good learning experience and made gains from this course."
9762800,How Immersion and Self-Avatars in VR Affect Learning Programming and Computational Thinking in Middle School Education,"We present an empirical evaluation of immersion and self-avatars as compared to desktop viewing in Virtual Reality (VR) for learning computer programming and computational thinking in middle school education using an educational VR simulation. Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences."
10669100,Formal Concept Analysis of Students’ Solutions on Computational Thinking Game,"Contribution: We present a framework for teachers to investigate the relationships between attributes of students’ solutions in the process of problem solving or computational thinking. We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion."

10343894,How to Develop CT Skills Using Robotics Projects Combined with Arts - a Pilot Study,"With the introduction of distance learning during the lockdown, teachers faced a number of problems on how to implement the teaching. Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes."
9206214,Programming is Fun! A Survey of the STEAM Digital Distribution Platform,"In order to engage the player, video games are often based on challenges that must be overcome.

9853848,Natural Language Programming with TryPL,"Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students."

10039663,A preliminary study on interdisciplinary programming learning based on cloud computing low-code development platform,"The application of “programming education” has become one of the future technological trends, and students with design backgrounds should also grasp this important development. In this study, the “AgilePoint NX” program course was established, and computational thinking was introduced into the course to guide students, through the image flow and low-code learning process, to carry out structured thinking and question speculation, and complete task exercises. This aims to teach design students to learn programming and computational thinking through a cloud-based low-code development platform with image processes and interdisciplinary learning processes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate the learning effect through classroom learning observation, simple questionnaire survey, imagination scale, and other methods. Finally, the study found that in interdisciplinary programming learning, different factors lead to low learning effects of programming courses for design background students, resulting in different degrees of learning pain points and learning experiences. The power of imagination test is a tentative exploration of this research, but for the low-code development platform with fewer measurement data and biased towards procedural thinking, only predictive exploration has no significant data to show the specific impact on the programming learning process, only As a reference for interdisciplinary study."

Computational thinking has been increasingly encouraged, not only for those who wish to become computer scientists, but also to develop other important skills that are used to solve problems, using a combination of critical thinking and fundamentals of computing. The research used was qualitative of the phenomenological type. In the analysis, the teachers involved concluded that to solve a problem, even if it is Ecology, it is not necessary to use a computer to process the algorithm to find the solution, a student can create an algorithm and process it and find the answer."
10058022,Sequential Behavior Analysis of Interdisciplinary Activities in Computational Thinking and EFL Learning With Game-Based Learning,"The study explores the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students’ English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students’ CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students take part in the experiment, of whom 28 are assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 are assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. Results indicate that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in English-language achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; and 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produces a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge, their learning anxieties are also lower than those of the control group. The analysis of behavioral patterns also reveals that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrate better language-learning interaction, whereas the students playing character-ER board game present greater CT development in finding solutions."
9637151,How do Bebras Tasks Explore Algorithmic Thinking Skill in a Computational Thinking Contest?,"This Research-to-Practice Full Paper examines the Bebras Challenge tasks, a Computational Thinking (CT) contest that does not require programming knowledge. Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities."

9453940,Evaluating a Computational Thinking and Computing Attitudes Instrument for Educational Purposes,"This paper explores a survey instrument on Computational Thinking (CT) and attitudes towards Computing for educational purposes. Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2,290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context."

However, not all schools or instructor are able to implement or deliver programming curriculum at the K-12 level. For novice programming, CT activities may help students to learn and appreciate problem-solving and programming capabilities. In this paper, an investigation to study the effectiveness and suitability of an unplugged CT activities has been carried out. This is part of the unplugged CT framework development process, where the first element investigated is the type of suitable activities. Two iterations were conducted to confirm the suitability of the activities. The activities were also verified with a selected group of secondary school teachers. The results have shown that unplugged activities can be effective in helping students to learn programming capability. The next step of the research is to identify other relevant components relevant to the framework for an unplugged CT activities for novice programmer."
9814929,An Automatic Grading System for a High School-level Computational Thinking Course,"Automatic grading systems help lessen the load of manual grading. Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student com-petency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so. Additionally, survey responses from course teachers support the importance of our work."
9779003,Research on the Construction of Evaluation Indicators of Students' Computational Thinking Based on Spectral Clustering,"The scientific and reasonable evaluation indicators that can fully reflect the various dimensions of students' computational thinking (CT) skills is the basis and premise of accurately evaluating students' CT skills, which is of great significance to the cultivation of students' CT skills. However, the current research on how to construct the evaluation indicators is still inadequate, and most of the research is put forward by the subjective experience of researchers, lacking objectivity and the universality of ability. In the paper, we comprehensively reviewed the concepts of CT in the theoretical literature of CT, aiming to construct the comprehensive and effective evaluation indicators of CT for students by clustering the keywords of CT concepts and extracting indicators. The validity of indicators is verified by qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and expert evaluation. The results show that the evaluation indicators of CT constructed by spectral clustering technology are a more scientific, more comprehensive reflection of the ability dimensions of CT. It has unique advantages in constructing objective and comprehensive evaluation indicators and provides an evaluation basis for the evaluation practice of CT skills."

10530940,Developing Future Computational Thinking in Foundational CS Education: A Case Study From a Liberal Education University in India,"Contribution: This article proposes a new theoretical model with a goal to develop future human computational thinking (CT) in foundational computer science (CS) education. The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan.Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course.Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens.Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability."
9333485,EEG-based Cognitive Load assessment in Matlab GUI and impact on Learning System,Computational thinking (CT) based learning system is a significant tool for developing the cognitive ability and problem-solving skill both in real life and education. This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before.

10402150,An Expression-Oriented Approach to Programming Education,"Learning programming language syntax is considered an obstacle in programming education. However, we believe it is an overlooked opportunity to exploit obvious synergies with Math. As evidenced around the world, middle and high school students know the syntax required to compute simple expressions, without previous exposure to programming languages. We make the case for an “expressions first” approach to facilitate the development of computational thinking. Our approach has the benefit of integrating directly with Math, which in turn reinforces the teaching of other STEM subjects as well as non-STEM ones. We report early results of an ongoing trial using a visual computing environment that supports this approach."

10868477,Developing a Game to Assess Abstraction Skills of Elementary Students: Design Principles and Validation Process,"Computational thinking (CT) is a crucial 21st-century skill, and its integration into K–12 education underscores the need for effective assessment tools. Although there are existing tools to measure CT practices, improvements can be made in terms of their assessment formats and data analysis methods. To address this gap, this study develops Critters Puzzle (CP), a game-based assessment tool aimed at measuring primary school students’ CT practices, specifically abstraction skills. Based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, 12 progressively challenging tasks were developed. To ensure the content validity of the tool, validation was put forward involving expert review and students’ cognitive interviews. Twenty-two experts were invited to review the appropriateness of the measurement and seven students (aged 6–10) were invited for interviews to evaluate the usability of the platform and its effectiveness as an assessment tool. Results indicated that the game is engaging, understandable, and appropriately challenging for students, and several modifications were made to the game based on the feedback from experts and interviewees. Future research will involve empirical studies to validate the game's psychometric properties, including its reliability and validity, as an assessment tool for CT practices."

9620708,Teacher And Student Empathy Interviews As An Instrument For Considering More Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways,"This paper presents the development and use of empathy interviews at Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) which is the fifth largest school district in the state. At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students."
9620568,Delivering Virtual K-8 Computing Professional Development in Rural KY,"Teachers living and working in rural areas in the United States often lack access to high-quality professional development (PD) opportunities. As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers."

9559050,Coding Training Proposal from Kindergarten to High School,"Over the past decade, the teaching of coding and computational thinking has become increasingly important in the school environment. If before they were a secondary part of the teaching program and provided only, at best, from the age of eleven and up, it is now clear that they should play a relevant role in the school curriculum as soon as possible. In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period. This work therefore aims to choose some of the tools available, designed for different needs but sufficiently similar in order to allow the development of a fluid and continuous coding educational path, gradually adding new complexities, starting from the age of three in the school of childhood, up to high school."

9620555,How Do We Do CS on Top of Everything Else? A Coaching Cycle Approach in Elementary School,"A key strategy for bringing computer science (CS) education to all students is the integration of computational thinking (CT) into core curriculum in elementary school. But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All."

10630378,Optimizing Network Management and Virtualization Using Machine Learning Approach: Network Slice Prediction,"This study demonstrates the utilization of Machine Learning (ML) for network slice prediction, enabling the optimization of resources for diverse network slices. Traditional methods for network slice prediction often lack efficiency and result in inaccuracies. By leveraging ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, an intelligent framework that automates network slice prediction is developed. This framework enhances network virtualization and management, facilitating resource allocation. The ML algorithms take real-time network conditions and usages, such as packet delay and smart city, as input and output for selecting the most suitable network slice. Data analysis is further conducted to reveal the connections between the input parameters and how these parameters influence the selection of the accurate network slice. Network slicing plays a crucial role as it enables the customization of services and facilitates efficient scaling to meet the specific needs of different applications and industries. The accuracy scores of the employed ML algorithms were generally perfect, except for the KNN and SVM classifiers, which achieved an accuracy of 94.30% and 92.16%, respectively, for the prediction of network slices based on incoming network connections and usages."
9410541,First Steps Towards Automatically Defining the Difficulty of Maze-Based Programming Challenges,"In a world where algorithms are ubiquitous, the development of computational thinking competencies is becoming progressively important among students, technology professionals, and 21st-century citizens in general. Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games."
9637147,PACT: A Citizen Science Project for Computing Education,"This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached."

9177007,An ISMP Approach for Promoting Design Innovation Capability and Its Interaction With Personal Characters,"This article develops an instruction method for promoting design innovation capability through a design-based program with identification, modeling, simulation, and prototyping (IMSP). The computational thinking and conceptualization of sustainability were incorporated. The interaction between instruction treatment and participants' personality was investigated. Eighty-six engineering undergraduates participated in this experimental study for exploring the effectiveness of the IMSP program. The findings indicate that 1) the IMSP program promoted undergraduates' computational thinking, and further enhanced their design innovation ability; 2) the program that integrated the conceptualization of sustainability has better teaching effects than that without the conceptual integration; 3) the personal characters of innovation proaction and emotional intelligence acted as moderators in the ISMP program. This study presents a practical method for improving design innovation capability, and supports the feasibility and necessity of emphasizing computational thinking and sustainability in the innovation training program for engineering education."
9429039,Designing “Bebras” Serious Games Interaction for Indonesian Upper Elementary School Students,"Computational thinking education nowadays gets more attention around the world because of its importance. In Indonesia, computational thinking has not received attention as much as in other developed countries. However, there is a community that already focuses on promoting computational thinking to Indonesian students through annual competitions, which is Bebras Indonesia. The problems that are used in the competition also have been adapted into a game. The game aims to help student practicing for the competition, but the game still has several limitations to be used by Indonesian students. Therefore, this paper researches similar games design interaction that suits Indonesian students, particularly for upper elementary school students. The type of the game is a serious game that has the main goal of learning. An approach of user-centered design was used to develop the design interaction. Usability testing was conducted to verify the result of the design interaction in two iterations. The result of the research shows that the design interaction is effective with a score of completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with a score of SEQ 6,37 out of 7. It is also enjoyable for students based on the result of the E-Gameflow questionnaire score of 5,83 out of 7 and an IMI enjoyability score of 5,77 out of 7."
9766646,Modeling At School – On the Benefits and Skill Development of the Use of Modeling Diagrams at School,"The introduction of Computational Thinking skills at school has mostly been associated with programming skills. In this paper we present an approach that is based on modeling, a skill that is commonly taught in Computer Science degrees, often in the last years as it is considered a higher-level, complex skill. Modeling includes various thinking processes like abstraction, reduction, structuring, generalization, among others, that are part of computational thinking in particular and problem solving in general, too. Our hypothesis is that using different modeling techniques from computer science (e.g., UML diagrams) in several subjects at school can be a good way to introduce computational thinking. Therefore we have performed a semi-controlled experiment with Ni=558 students (age 8-16) and N2=18 educators that have used modeling in their lessons. Our results show a promising effect of the use of modeling in the lessons. Educators have a positive vision of modeling."
10893066,Innovative Approach to Enhancing STEM Skills through Educational Games: Work in Progress,"This innovative practice paper describes a work in progress on creating and applying educational games that develop mathematical and computational thinking within the project Science&Math educational games from preschool to university - SciMaG. Using educational games, especially in STEM fields, is an effective way to engage students and promote key skills across different age groups and environments. Such activities promote problem solving, logical thinking, strategic planning, and other important skills and can be used with students of different age groups in the classroom, in extracurricular activities, or at home. STEM science outreach activities organized as part of science festivals and similar events can be an excellent opportunity for a game-based approach. However, organizing events for large numbers of participants can pose a logistical challenge in terms of volunteer availability. This paper presents the results of a study in which game-based activities to develop mathematical and computational thinking were integrated into a science outreach event for primary school students on the occasion of Pi-Day. The innovative aspect of the approach is reflected in the use of a combination of games (commercial, newly developed games, and games inspired by commercial ones) which have an interesting math basis and require mathematical or computational thinking skills as well as in the introduction of peer teaching through attracting high-school students as volunteers for the organized event. In the evaluation of the approach, the perceptions of the primary school students (Ns=295), their teachers (NT=19), and the high-school students participating as volunteers in the organized event (Nv=11) were examined using a questionnaire-based study. All groups of participants responded positively and confirmed educational potential of the games. Results confirmed that the activities were well-received and that such events have the potential to enhance learning experiences in STEM.

DEPICT (Discovering Computational Thinking through Creative Writing) is a pioneering project aimed at integrating computational thinking (CT) principles into high school (HS) creative writing (CW) classes. Developed by computer science (CS) undergraduate students, DEPICT for Out for School Time (DEPICT4OST) introduces a set of 16 innovative lessons designed to foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and algorithmic reasoning through the medium of CW. This WIP presents an exploration of the undergraduate experience in apprenticeship in the K12 outreach instructional space, crafting the DEPICT curriculum and the transformative journey of teaching others through the creation of engaging hands-on activities. Data was collected through pre- and post program surveys, classroom observations, and student work samples to assess the impact of the DEPICT program. The analysis involved comparing quantitative survey results, coding qualitative data from observations and students reflections, and evaluating changes in student work to determine the effectiveness of the program in achieving its educational goals. Drawing upon their expertise in CS and passion for creative expression, the undergraduate team embarked on the task of bridging the seemingly disparate domains of CT and CW. Through collaborative brainstorming sessions, iterative design processes, and pedagogical research, they developed a diverse range of lesson plans that seamlessly integrate computational concepts into writing prompts, narrative structures, and story-telling techniques. The practices of DEPICT4OST build upon a departmental emphasis on student ownership of outreach activity, which will be described in the paper. The paper explores the challenges of adapting complex computational concepts for HS students and aligning activities with educational standards. It also highlights the creative solutions the undergraduate team developed to make these abstract principles accessible and engaging through interactive writing exercises, group discussions, and multimedia presentations. Furthermore, the paper explores the pedagogical insights gained through the hands-on experience of teaching the DEPICT curriculum to HS students. The undergraduates reflect on their role as facilitators of learning, the impact of active learning techniques on student engagement, and the evolution of their teaching practices. By sharing anecdotes, student feedback, and reflections, the paper offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of infusing CT into CW education. In conclusion, DEPICT represents a pioneering initiative that harnesses the interactions between CT and creative expression to enrich HS education. The paper not only documents the development of the DEPICT curriculum but also underscores the transformative potential of collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches to education. Through the exploration of the under-graduate experience, it offers a roadmap for future endeavors seeking to innovate in the realm of STEAM education."

9231881,Promoting Computer Science Learning with Block-Based Programming and Narrative-Centered Gameplay,"Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need for all students in primary and secondary education to learn computer science (CS) concepts and skills. Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities. Building on these findings, we discuss design implications for creating student-adaptive CS learning experiences in educational games that incorporate block-based programming enriched narrative-centered gameplay."

9245275,Inquiry-Based Python Programming at Secondary Schools,"Programming is a traditional part of informatics education from Primary to Upper Secondary Education in Slovakia. We have seen a growing interest of using Python in programming at our secondary schools during the past six years. However, the transition from using the still prevalent Pascal to Python is often only formal, regardless of the language specifics of Python. In addition, teaching programming is oriented primarily to mastering language constructions. In the frame of the National project IT Academy we have focused on inquiry-based programming teaching. In our teaching and learning materials we exploit the 5E learning cycle. Firstly, pupils are engaged in a topic, then they explore a topic and give explanation for their findings, then elaborate on their learning and finally are evaluated. Their learning is not focused just on acquiring skills and experience using suitable Python commands and data structures, but also on using various problem solving strategies. The paper presents examples of teaching materials and interesting findings and comments from pilot teachers."
9962606,Measuring Cognitive Loads while Learning Computational Statistics,"This work-in-progress paper is part of a project that aims to analyze how the implementation of different instructional designs through complete and incomplete examples influence the cognitive load that students perceive when learning statistics and computer programming. For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome."
9373094,Virtual/Mixed Reality Control of a Game Through Scratch,"Virtual Reality has been one of the interesting topics that have risen in the previous years. It has diverged into many fields including medicine, tourism, and education. On the other hand, new techniques have been used for teaching programming rather than the traditional paper and pen technique. The work presented in this paper proposes a new way of teaching children programming using the Virtual Reality (VR) technology. A game has been implemented with Scratch-like background to test whether the immersive factor of VR would have a positive effect on the learning outcome of the children. A study has been conducted on 10 participants to compare between two techniques for teaching the basic programming concepts: VR game and Desktop game. Results showed that the mean of the learning gain of the VR group was higher than the Desktop mean but with no significant p-value. However, the engagement test results showed that the participants were more engaged to the VR game than the Desktop game with p-value of 0.032."
9766723,Game-Based Learning for Young Children: A Case Study,"The adoption of technologies such as tablets or smartphones for children at home or at school is one of the most recent trends in today’s world. This challenges for suitable teaching methodologies and practices, along with oriented learning contents for such devices. On the one hand, teachers and tutors may acquire skills and competences to cope with gadgets and its technologies. On the other hand, learners must be versatile onto a complementary and complex environment in which the virtual meets the traditional lectures. Moreover, when the learning ecosystem includes children and younger newbies with technologies and gadgets is promising the adoption of targeted approaches such as gamification, playful activities and/or high interactive and supportive learning. This study presents the introduction of game-based learning techniques for young children at Cape Verde, with 17 students aged from 4 to 11 years, using the Code Karts app. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of the coding app, ability to play Code Karts, conceptual understanding of coding, and in-class behaviours. Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming. Complementary studies must be addressed aiming at to evaluate the long term effect on children due to the adoption of programming activities in the classroom."
9274063,Grammar Instruction with UML,"Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results."
9375562,Design and Implementation of Virtual Experiment on Character Encoding,"In university computer course, character encoding and its processing involves multiple hardware, and the process is relatively complex and mostly invisible, which makes it difficult for students to understand. In this paper, a virtual experiment is proposed to this process. By using Blockly and other tools, students can independently design character encoding and write Blockly code to describe the whole process of character processing. Relying on virtual reality and human-computer interaction technology, the whole process of character processing can be visually demonstrated. It enables students to deeply understand the functions of various character encodings and deepens the understanding of binary coding methods."
9688834,The Practice and Exploration of Scratch Programming Instruction in Elementary School Based on Game Design,"With the proposal of quality-oriented education, Scratch programming teaching in elementary schools is of great importance to the growth and development of students. The visual interface, building block programming, and easy-to-use features of Scratch are suitable for teaching elementary school students, which can also better cultivate students’ analytical problem-solving skills and enhance their logical thinking. However, only a part of schools and students are currently learning this programming, and it is not popular enough yet. Moreover, if the teaching is mainly based on the teacher’s explanation, it will be boring. Therefore, there is a need to explore the teaching based on game design and combine teaching with fun, so that learning can become a more acceptable “game” for students, making the classroom atmosphere more active and improving the teaching quality of the classroom."
9274230,Research to Practice: Keeping STEM student recruitment fresh and relevant using peer mentoring,"This work in progress paper in the research-to-practice category focuses on high school students planning to enter a new learning environment for transition. Prospective students benefit from structured programming that considers two factors. First, the college knowledge required to navigate day-to-day logistics including new living arrangements, supporting physical & mental health, and funding the experience. Second, STEM curricula and challenges students from extremely rural communities face in identifying with these rigorous programs. The work of influential researchers in student transition and retention along with contextual findings from a large, rural state in the Rocky Mountain region informed the redesign of an engineering college's outreach program. This paper has two purposes. First, it details how established theories combined with research findings and assessment can create robust models to support keeping recruitment programs relevant. Second, it provides an example of how a model was developed and then used to redesign and assess an outreach program using college peer mentors to support high school-aged students interested in engineering and computing disciplines."

Findings from this pilot study shed light on how to mobilize Latine and multilingual students’ rich languages and cultures for equitable computer science learning."
10111198,"Build Bridges between Conversation, Story, Visual Programming, and Text-based Programming in K-8 Education","In this paper, we create a learning path and curate projects that let students learn certain computational concepts in a consistent way that bridges story, conversation, visual programming, and text-based programming. Our approach is to provide young children with both visual and text-based programming materials that are directly associated with the computational logic in some selected children’s daily dialogues and stories. We demonstrate this combo-design idea with examples of roleplaying, Snap! program, and Python code. Our design pattern and examples could be adapted to other suitable children’s activities in different school settings on a variety of technology platforms."
9576398,Demonstrating Concepts Through Visual Simulators: Two Cases in the Programming Domain,"One of the ways to demonstrate subject-domain concepts is to let the learner play in the domain-related sandbox, while receiving the explanations of the domain laws that were broken when the user makes a wrong move. This can help the learners who understand definitions of the concepts poorly. We present two visual simulators for demonstrating concept properties and domain laws, implemented as web applications. They can be used to study programming, enabling trial-and-error learning, supported by the error messages, explaining why the user's action was wrong."

10869241,Research on the Social Epistemic Network (SENS) for Promoting Deeper Learning in University Students through Online Knowledge Construction,"This study explores the impact of online collaborative knowledge construction on Deeper Learning among university students. Utilizing Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), we examined interaction behaviors and cognitive development in a foundational computer science course. Data were collected from a Chinese university over nine weeks, involving two experimental phases. The analysis categorized students into core and peripheral groups based on centrality metrics, revealing significant differences in their engagement and learning levels. Core group members demonstrated higher cognitive development and problem-solving abilities, with dense connections in higher-order cognitive stages. In contrast, peripheral group members showed limited interaction and basic cognitive outcomes. The findings emphasize the critical role of collaboration and communication in fostering Deeper Learning, suggesting the need for educational institutions to adopt new teaching methods and technologies. By promoting high-order cognition and collaborative learning, educators can enhance students' critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving skills, ultimately contributing to a dynamic and enriched learning environment."
9962433,Capitalizing on a Small Dataset to Refine a Mixed Methods Study,"Learning to use computational tools is a critical aspect of many first-year engineering courses. Students in these courses can have varying degrees of prior exposure to computational tools and often exhibit a wide range of intrinsic motivation for learning these skills. Interviews with first-year engineering students were conducted to study the degree to which motivation correlated with intended major within engineering. The pilot round of interviews was conducted in the spring of 2021. This pilot study used the same data set of 8 interviews to progressively refine both the survey and interview collection in the 2021 – 2022 academic year. This paper will review the results of the pilot study and detail the process used to develop and use the finalized protocol and coding schemes for a planned series of 20 interviews in Summer 2022. While this technique developed because of limited data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been beneficial to the researcher and may provide guidance for future researchers."

10892956,Work in Progress: Integration of AI Tools on an Open-Ended Computer Programming Project,"This work-in-progress, innovative practice paper describes the design and implementation of a computer programming project that encouraged students to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT). This innovative practice was implemented at a state university in an introduction to programming course. Course assessments included weekly homework assignments, an open-ended project, one quiz, and three midterm exams. Students were explicitly told in class and in the syllabus that no AI was allowed for weekly homework assignments; however, students were encouraged to use AI for the open-ended project. This decision was made because the problems on weekly assignments were more structured and could be easily solved by AI tools. In comparison, the learning objective of the project was focused on code design with open-ended requirements making it harder for AI to provide workable code. Students who reported using AI indicated that they used it to help start the project and/or a piece of the project and to aid in debugging or finding errors. Project grades were similar to grades seen in previous years for similar projects; however, grades on midterm two, which occurred after the project, were surprisingly higher than the grades for midterm one and higher than exam grades from previous years on similar topics. At this point, we do not know if/how the project contributed to these improved exam scores. Given the success of the project in its first implementation, Dr. E plans to use the assignment in future semesters. Additionally, Dr. C plans to collect data to begin exploring how the use of AI tools in this open-ended project supported students' learning and understanding of principles in the course."

9734892,Assessing the Impact of Gamification in Higher Education: An Experimental Study using Kahoot! and Nearpod During COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed rapid and significant changes upon education systems. Most educational institutions transferred abruptly from traditional face-to-face delivery to distance learning formats through virtual classrooms. As a result of this shift, many faculty members have faced challenges in keeping their students engaged during lectures. Gamification is often proposed as a promising solution to enhance student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes attainment. This study investigates the effectiveness of the gamification mechanism on undergraduate students in a computer programming course using Kahoot! and Nearpod during distance learning. The findings of the study show that there is some correlation between student engagement, learning motivation, academic performance, and the use of gamification."
10305639,Supporting End-to-End Coding and Use of Arduinos in a Formal Classroom Environment,"This paper presents the design of a browser-based Arduino programming tool and learning management system (LMS), CASMM, that offers end-to-end support for learners utilizing Chromebooks in a classroom environment. This tool aims to support learners through the entire process of coding and using Arduinos in group projects at scale in formal classrooms. The novelty of this tool and its discussion for the VL/HCC community lies in the design and customization of this tool to meet real world constraints of formal classrooms. In addition, it encourages expansion of who we consider users and requires inclusion of where and how learning takes place to truly support human-centered development of programming tools. In this paper, we shift the focus from individual users to multiple groups of student users and 1–3 teachers/mentors in a classroom environment. In particular, this paper aims to make explicit the unique needs of teachers and students who may have limited technology expertise both in coding and using Arduinos in formal classroom environments, the human and technological constraints of a formal classroom and features we've designed into CASMM to address these needs. Through this paper, we aim to spark discussion about the human-centered requirements of these users and how tools that support learners end-to-end in the development process may be necessary to truly provide accessible programming languages and environments for a wide range of novices (i.e., students, classroom teachers, and college mentors/volunteers)."

10211374,A Teacher-Focused Impact Assessment in Scratch4All Project,"The “Scratch4All” project aims to reduce school dropout rates by encouraging and motivating students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary schools to achieve academic success. In addition, the project promotes true equality of opportunity in terms of educational resources. A learning environment that contributes positively to the improvement of educational results is created through the use of new technologies, specifically programming in the Scratch language and robotics. Impact indicators were developed and used as project evaluation tools based on Theory of Change. This paper presents and analyzes the changes observed from the perspective of the project’s teachers’ stakeholders during the 2020/2021 school year. This group of beneficiaries is critical to the project’s success and continuation, not only because of the special relationship they have with the students, but also with their families and the school. The assessment of impact is very positive in terms of indicators such as school success and motivation, particularly in Mathematics and Portuguese Language, as well as in the reduction of inequalities, access to new technologies, and contribution to gender equality."
9829452,Applications of Machine Learning to Form-giving in Industrial Design,"Machine learning is a key technology to design and develop products, systems, and even services. In particular, image classification using deep learning has been successfully applied to many fields. Although industrial designers might learn this is an opportunity for their best practice, studies demonstrating how to integrate the technology into the design process are rare. Thus, we discussed the need to introduce ML to industrial design by presenting examples and ML tools with lower scientific thresholds such as Weka that is preferable for industrial design students and practitioners. A five-stage process of applying ML to product form-giving is presented to illustrate the bridging of ML to the design process. Further technical details and industry case studies are needed to demonstrate evidence of the advantages of ML in form-giving. The implication is not only in sharpening the tools of product form-giving but also in rethinking the theories of industrial design."
9272475,Bridge to Computing: An outreach program for at-risk young men,"In 2017, our police department and the Give Back Organization (GBO), a local non-profit, contacted our university about hosting a game development summer camp. The camp was proposed to keep boys ages 12-15 living in a community with high levels of gang enrollment off the streets while providing an opportunity to learn about college and computing careers. The police also wanted to improve officer-youth r elations. Our lab provided camp counselors, space, and content for the camp. Each camp supported a total of twelve African-American boys. Over three years, we refactored the curricula and organization of the camp and present our lessons learned from the experience."
9490241,Teaching Machine Learning in K–12 Classroom: Pedagogical and Technological Trajectories for Artificial Intelligence Education,"Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking."
9529183,"Applying Game Learning Analytics to a Voluntary Video Game: Intrinsic Motivation, Persistence, and Rewards in Learning to Program at an Early Age","Learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of Computational Thinking. Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards."
9994685,Do Structured Flowcharts Outperform Pseudocode? Evidence From Eye Movements,"Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills."
9637170,Adapting an OER Textbook for the Inverted Classroom Model — How To Flip the Classroom with BBC micro:bit Example Tasks,"Full Paper Research-to-Practice The current COVID-19 crisis has created significant challenges for schools. The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale."
9201802,Teaching reform of programming basic course based on SPOC blended teaching method,"As an important course in computer education in higher education, the programming basic course has problems in teaching and learning. The role of teachers is knowledge imparters. And the teaching methods despise students' development. Students often have fears and difficulties in their study, which is not conducive to build their computer application ability and computational thinking. In view of the teaching status quo and existing problems of the programming basic course, this paper proposes to use SPOC blended teaching mode to clarify the role of teachers and students, to develop an interactive teaching mode, to adopt case teaching, to enrich SPOC resources. And we provide students with timely feedback, and change the evaluation methods and other aspects. Through these reforms, we found that students' ability to read and write programs have been improved. The quality of teaching, and the cultivation of computational thinking are improved."
9569250,Identifying Preliminary Design Principles for a Robotics-based Learning Environment,"In recent years, the interest in introducing programming activities into the classroom has increased, emphasizing the importance of promoting computational thinking in young learners. Robotics-based learning environments are intended to facilitate the learning of programming at the primary level and support developing skills such as collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving thinking in a cross-curricular approach. An Austrian research project focuses on developing and implementing a robotics-based learning environment using the educational design research approach to gain insights into the introduction of computational thinking in primary education. This paper reports on a study to identify preliminary design principles of the learning environment that form the basis of the prototyping cycle of the overall research. Data were collected by interviewing seven experts who have theoretical and practical expertise on educational robotics in primary education. The resulting six preliminary design principles describe the first insight into the design of robotics-based learning environments."
10714578,RULER: Prebugging with Proxy-Based Programming,"While block-based programming has successfully eliminated critical syntactic barriers to programming, it remains unclear how effectively it aids in overcoming semantic, logical, and pragmatic programming challenges that hinder computational thinking. These challenges are likely to far outweigh the syntactic ones. With the goal of creating a highly accessible programming tool for young students using mobile devices, we explored the concept of pragmatic prebugging to begin addressing these challenges. By pragmatic prebugging, we refer to proactive debugging tools designed to prevent logical errors. This article introduces RULER.game as a Computational Thinking Tool with built-in pragmatic prebugging, enabling novice programmers to create games through a paradigm we call proxy-based programming. A small study exploring error rates found statistically significant performance improvements of proxy-based programming compared to block-based programming."
10654434,Problem-Solving Through Pair-Programming: The Mediational Role of ChatGPT,"In this study the pair computational problem-solving between the student and ChatGPT was analyzed. The three university students who were experienced in using Python program in computational problem-solving participated in the study. In data collection, a problem involving “limit and sequence” from calculus was used to examine students' collaboration with ChatGPT. Students were asked to construct a program that produces a solution to this problem in Python, and meanwhile, it was stated that they could work in pairs with ChatGPT. The responses provided by ChatGPT to the students in the computational problem-solving were evaluated in both computational and mathematical contexts and a list of cases in which ChatGPT could and could not support students in the computational thinking practices was created. Aside from the incorrect or implicit answers provided by ChatGPT, in general, it was determined that ChatGPT supported the student's performance in computational thinking. It was deduced that it was important for the student to make a rational problem-solving plan and to guide the ChatGPT with the appropriate prompts in order to use rational questioning that leads to productive argumentation with ChatGPT."
10569899,The Importance of Algorithmic Thinking Development in Primary Education,"Advances in computer technology have expanded our capacity to solve problems on a scale never imagined, using strategies previously unavailable to us. Today’s ""digital natives"" have grown up in a world where technology is rapidly evolving, creating new fields of study, new types of jobs, and requiring new skill sets. Algorithmic and computational thinking are foundations for solving different problems from all domains and are not always closely related to computers and programming. They are currently primarily used in teaching computer science and STEM subjects but can be applied to all subjects and in all life situations. The paper presents the need to develop computational thinking in various subjects of primary education, with particular emphasis on combining digital (""plugged"") and non-digital (""unplugged"") activities, as well as on the development of algorithmic thinking. Four methodological scenarios with activities for the development of algorithmic thinking in primary education are presented."
10578599,Information Encoding in Computer Science Education Using the Cup Song,"Problem solving plays a central role in computer science classes, whereby the problems to be analyzed are often already available in encoded form. The initial process where the learners have to parse information into symbols using adequate representations, has hardly been considered systematically so far. However, encoding development is essential for the understanding of sign processes and for general education. This paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called “Cup Song Encoding” designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. It simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters Computational Thinking of students. The material of the teaching unit is available online. The teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in K-12 during which the students' solutions were recorded and examined. The outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to K-12 computer science education. The results also show how Computational Thinking methods can be integrated in computer science classes."
10423676,The emergence of algorithmics in grade 1: a study within the mathematical curriculum,"This article presents a study carried out with two grade 1 classes, in the context of implementing the new Mathematics' curriculum. A sequence of tasks was carried out with the purpose of developing computational thinking, practices articulated with learning about the topic Numbers, and an attempt was made to identify the five practices of computational thinking in the students' activities. We ascertained that the students mobilized all the practices, the emergence of algorithmics coming to the fore and, at the same time, these practices allowed them to delve deeper into their mathematical knowledge in the content explored in the topic Numbers."
8735739,DeepStealth: Game-Based Learning Stealth Assessment With Deep Neural Networks,"A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures."
9223343,When Positive Perception of the Robot Has No Effect on Learning,"Humanoid robots, with a focus on personalised social behaviours, are increasingly being deployed in educational settings to support learning. However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities."
9202832,Automatic Formative Assessment in Computer Science: Guidance to Model-Driven Design,"Adaptive online learning can facilitate students' support by responding immediately to the user's interactions. Good feedback to students helps closing the gap between actual and desired performance. In this paper we analyze how to introduce online adaptive formative learning in Computer Science, a discipline with well documented challenges that are hard to tackle with traditional classroom methods. Specifically, we developed illustrative learning items teaching Model-Driven Design and implemented them in an online system that implements a model for automatic formative assessment developed by University of Torino. The model takes advantage of an automatic assessment system initially designed for STEM disciplines, then adopted for teaching languages and other disciplines too. The key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. These features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects. We chose MDD because it is a topic of Computer Science education connected with Computational Thinking, software design, and formal methods, which are three of the core areas in need of enhanced support."
10054368,A Systematic Literature Review in Robotics Experiential Learning With Computational and Adversarial Thinking,"The rise of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the increasing reliance on the digital economy drive the need for a new set of skills, especially in robotics learning, that includes computational thinking (CT) and adversarial thinking (AT) for the young generation. The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications."
9694082,Curriculum Design of Artificial Intelligence in Middle School - Taking Posture Recognition as an Example,"At present, there is still a lack of suitable artificial intelligence curriculum in primary and secondary schools in China. Based on a project-based learning model, an artificial intelligence course was designed for middle school-aged students.

In the process of teaching, the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability was paid great attention, and teaching example was given at the end of the paper."
9755942,Sucre4Stem: Collaborative Projects Based on IoT Devices for Students in Secondary and Pre-University Education,"This paper describes a new technological evolution of the Sucre project, which aims to foster a vocation for science and develop computational thinking and programming skills in pre-university students. This improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions."
9149481,Usability evaluation of block programming tools in IoT contexts for initial engineering courses,"Scratch has been shown as one of the main tools for teaching Computational Thinking through the concept of(block-based) programming. In the present research, two platforms based on/inspired by Scratch were considered for the analysis of their usability characteristics through the Cognitive Walkthrough method, for later use by engineering students at the beginning of their university courses for the development of their competences of logical thinking and abstraction of complex concepts: Snap4Arduino (used in the development of solutions for Internet of Things), and; App Inventor (used in the development of Android applications). The results show a positive evaluation of these tools, generating motivation for their use by new engineering students in their teaching-learning processes."
9453973,Exploring the Programming Concepts Practiced by Scratch Users: an Analysis of Project Repositories,"Scratch enables children to learn about programming by creating games and animations, and is currently one of the most popular introductory programming languages. While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops."

The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation. The experience was considered successful in its planning and application, with a positive evaluation of the participating students."

9678771,"Japanese Elementary Schools' Playful Programming Curriculum Considerations: Readiness, Limitations and Teacher Training","Japan's elementary school educators are facing the difficult task of teaching computer programming education and computational thinking in a playful way which affords students' time to acquire new knowledge while discovering new technology. Japan as a nation has constantly ranked lower than other developed nations in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy. The recent introduction of programming education has created an additional task for educators to learn about programming in order to teach it. Programming education was introduced in April 2020, and little research has been done to measure the knowledge gap of educators. In March 2020, a month before the implementation of programming instruction in Japanese schools, 22 elementary schools were visited to access readiness and to distribute an online survey. The surveys and informal interviews revealed the unpreparedness of educators for the task of teaching programming and limited programming material in the approved textbooks. This research is intended to inform stakeholders in order to improve the fundamental training of in-service and pre-service educators so they can have the necessary knowledge and confidence to teach programming in a fun and playful manner to their students."
10343492,Exploring the Design and Implementation of a Robotic-Coding Camp in Teacher Education,"This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem."
9453891,Review of Learning Design Choices of Primary School Programming Courses in Empirical Researches,"Programming, most recently in the form of Computational Thinking (CT), is emerging as a new subject in primary schools worldwide. By data-based decision making, teachers, as learning designers, make decisions on instruction design based on a broad range of evidence, such as student assessment scores and classroom teaching observations. Given the current limitations on conclusive, field-proven teaching practices and an underlying “culture” to use as a basis, we turn to pertinent empirical studies that the growing scientific interest on introducing programming in primary school curricula has produced. The hypothesis is that we may overcome the lack of extensive experience in designing a programming course by reviewing the above evidence, in order to frame learning situations and methods."
10577151,STEM-Based Bayesian Computational Learning Model-BCLM for Effective Learning of Bayesian Statistics,"This work contributes to the comprehension of Bayes’ theorem inclusive Bayesian probabilities and Bayesian inferencing within the framework of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) and cognitive learning w.r.t Bloom’s taxonomy (BT). Bayes’ theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes’ mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model. The proposed model is named the Bayesian Computational Learning Model (BCLM). Subsequently, we have probed the utility of BCLM in the design and plan of learning activities, coherent to the STEM paradigm and BT cognitive learning hierarchy."
10342890,Computational Notebooks in a Finite Element Analysis Course: Engineering Students' Reflections on the Value and Challenges of Computational Approaches,"This work-in-progress paper introduces an innovative approach that uses computational notebooks to teach Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate course to aid the understanding of complex phenomena in Mechanics of Materials, and enhance students' computational thinking skills. Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills. Early exposure to coding, modeling, and simulation techniques is crucial in preparing students for the computational demands of modern engineering workplaces."
10054028,Modeling Learners to Early Predict Their Performance in Educational Computer Games,"Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners’ interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model."
9954081,Protobot: An Educational Game for Algorithmic Thinking,"Algorithm has been heavily used to provide a comfort life for us: from finding the best route in Google map to biometrics authentication on your phone. The significant of algorithm defines Computational thinking (CT) as one of the 21st Century skills. Although CT has been integrated into the education in the past years, many students still struggle with CT concept due to the complication of the topic and limited learning methods provided in school environment. To provide alternative learning approach for algorithmic thinking, we propose a game-base learning system called Protobot. Protobot requires students to apply their CT knowledge, especially the algorithmic thinking to solve problems in the gameplay. The experimental results demonstrate that Protobot fosters the algorithmic thinking skill of the players as well as provides the amusement during the gameplay."

9894554,Development and Assessment of Recommendation System Based on Behavioral Intervention Analysis,"Computer science education in primary and secondary schools uses the. visual programming language ""Scratch "" to learn computational thinking. However, the limited number of course hours and overwhelmed teachers delay students’ learning progression. Although many Scratch instructional videos are available online, students still fail because of a lack of keyword-searching ability. Given this learning dilemma, we use the existing teaching videos online as hints assisting students in learning ""Scratch."" This project uses OpenCV to record the program blocks and analyze the behavioral intentions, and then compares and analyzes it with the video content to recommend and mark relevant segments that students need. We believe that through this recommendation system, intelligent hints in the form of videos can cultivate students’ self-learning ability and improve current teaching adversity."
10449552,Fostering Student Competencies in Creative Project Work Through STEAM and Artificial Intelligence in Teaching Art,"The objective of this study is to determine if there exists a statistically significant distinction between high school pupils who get instruction in the topic of “Art” through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and those who receive instruction through the integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM). Creativity, particularly within the realm of art and design, is commonly perceived as the ability to think beyond conventional boundaries. The study posited an alternative perspective by equating computational thinking with creative thinking. A total of forty-two kids from a high school in Kazakhstan were chosen as case studies for the topic of Art. The objective is to facilitate the integration of STEM education and art-based education."
10342646,An Elaboration of Research Led Computer Science Framework for Early Education,"Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly."

10343392,The Effects of an Accessible Computing Curriculum for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"There has been a limited number of studies in which a computing curriculum is designed and developed for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but no study has tested the effectiveness of an accessible computing curriculum for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct. When the correlations between CTCs and sessions for individual groups (PDMS & RCA) were analyzed, both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in increasing scores of synchronization and all CTCs as a single construct. The accessible and the original CT curriculums were also statistically significantly effective in improving students' learning of data representation and abstraction, respectively."
10578626,Games for Coding to Attract New Students to STEM,"There is a need to increase the number of students, especially women, choosing programming and STEM disciplines. We need innovative approaches in schools to better engage students and awake their interest in computer science. This paper addresses the need to create tools that effectively support the learning of programming and the development of computational thinking, highlighting why video games can be an effective educational tool for it and also attract new students to STEM. The Game4Coding Erasmus+ project proposes the design of a video game called CodeQuest, using a game genre that has not been frequently used before to address the teaching of programming, the monster tamer genre. We consider that video games have a number of benefits such as that stimulate active learning, are engaging for a wide range of students, and present information in a way that is attractive to learners. We want to explore this kind of game's effectiveness as a learning tool as well as its effect on the perception of STEM disciplines and programming to attract new public to coding (especially girls)."
10893514,WIP: Supporting Student Understanding of Finite Element Analysis and Computational Science: Classroom Scaffolding and ChatGPT,"This work-in-progress research paper presents the preliminary results of a study exploring the effectiveness of using computational notebooks to enhance student learning in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course for undergraduate Mechanical Engineering students. Our previous work has shown that students often face difficulties in grasping abstract concepts from mechanics of materials while simultaneously learning computational modeling. However, students recognized several advantages of using MATLAB for FEA compared to manual calculations, including significant time savings, increased efficiency, and reduced errors. Nevertheless, they also faced challenges, including a steep learning curve for MATLAB and concerns about how this limitation hinders their conceptual understanding. Despite these drawbacks, they recognized the importance and value of developing computational skills for their future careers. In this study, we extended the scaffolds and changed the sequence of activities to address the challenges the students faced in the previous iteration of our work. Specifically, we provided worked examples that students needed to use, self-explain, and modify before they engaged in programming from scratch. Also, after developing a basic understanding of how to implement FEA in MATLAB, the students used ChatGPT to generate a code that would do the same task. This activity required them to evaluate and refine automatically generated MATLAB code, as ChatGPT may provide alternative solutions that might not always work correctly. We explore three main topics to understand student experiences with and perceptions of this approach: (1) the value of using computational methods compared to manual completion for FEA; (2) the challenges and support of using MATLAB for FEA; and (3) the effectiveness of simulation tools to learn FEA. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) supporting student learning of intricate phenomena explored in mechanics of materials, like distribution of stress, and stiffness, and (2) fostering essential computational thinking skills through practical disciplinary coding experience. By implementing these elements, the study anticipates a substantial improvement in students' understanding of FEA principles and their ability to translate them into solutions for real-world engineering challenges."
10749837,F1TENTH: Enhancing Autonomous Systems Education Through Hands-On Learning and Competition,"Teaching autonomous and intelligent transportation systems in higher education has traditionally focused on theory, often lacking comprehensive coverage of the practical techniques required for real-world applications. To overcome this, we developed a new university course centered around hands-on learning with a modular autonomous small-scale vehicle platform called F1TENTH. This paper presents a detailed overview of the new course design, its underlying philosophy, the individual teaching modules, and the modular hardware/software of the F1TENTH platform. This new course was then evaluated with a survey conducted at five universities that have adopted the teaching modules for their semester-long undergraduate and graduate courses. The results show that approximately 80% of all involved students strongly agree that the hardware platform and modules significantly increased their motivation to learn. More than 70% of the students agreed that the hardware enhanced their understanding of the material The findings demonstrate that our course setup and the F1TENTH hardware effectively combine theoretical knowledge with practical application, greatly enhancing the educational outcomes and the students' computational thinking skills. Future research is needed to explore the long-term impact of hands-on learning on students' career development in intelligent autonomous systems."
9764091,Implementing Blended Learning in K-12 Programming Course: Lesson Design and Student Feedback,"Computational thinking (CT) has been widely integrated into K-12 classrooms through programming education. Numerous initiatives have been developed to lower down the threshold for learning programming, yet instructors may still feel ill-prepared. Blended learning approach, a combination of student-centered learning and teacher-centered instruction, has proved to be an effective teaching approach for K-12 programming courses. With the purpose of providing practical insights for the design of blended programming lessons, this study introduced an instructional unit of a K-12 programming course in a secondary school in China. It elaborated the course regarding lesson design, learning assessment, and course evaluation. The course contains 9 plugged sessions and 24 unplugged sessions, and each session consists of 1) a preview, 2) hands-on activities, and 3) a lesson summary. Student learning was evaluated with performance-based assessments, and a questionnaire was employed to collect students’ feedback for the course. The results indicated that students with low performance were the benefit the most from the course, and students tended to like visual programming tool and stage-mode learning format. Also, students with different learning backgrounds showed different preferences for the instructional elements. Suggestions are provided for further research and course design practices."
9962388,A Python-based lab module to conduct thermodynamic cycle analysis,"A Python-based lab activity was developed for a remote Thermodynamics course to add computational thinking to traditional analytical problem solving. Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers. Nevertheless, the positive learning outcomes were encouraging. Whether students pursue a career in thermodynamics or in a broader engineering field, this lab experience equipped them with tools that can augment their engineering skills."
9637257,Mutual Improvement between Teaching Materials and Assessment Tools for K-12 Programming Education,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents an approach to improve teaching materials and assessment tools for K-12 programming education together by creating a virtuous cycle. Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together."
9911432,Modelling Assessment Rubrics through Bayesian Networks: a Pragmatic Approach,"Automatic assessment of learner competencies is a fundamental task in intelligent tutoring systems. An assessment rubric typically and effectively describes relevant competencies and competence levels. This paper presents an approach to deriving a learner model directly from an assessment rubric defining some (partial) ordering of competence levels. The model is based on Bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills. The simple elicitation of the model starting from the assessment rubric opens up the possibility of quickly automating the assessment of several tasks, making them more easily exploitable in the context of adaptive assessment tools and intelligent tntorino systems."
9904876,An Ontology to Formalize a Creative Problem Solving Activity,"Our study is set in an educational context: to better teach and assess 21st-century skills, such as computational thinking or creative problem solving, we propose to formalize a specific activity that involves these competencies. This activity, referred to as #CreaCube, is presented as an open-ended problem which consists of assembling a set of robotic cubes into an autonomous vehicle. We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving activity is part of an exploratory research action. In addition, an effective proof of concept is described in this study."
10892884,Notional Machines for Inclusive Learning,"Understanding computing concepts is one of the foundational elements of computational thinking, which helps students formulate logic and algorithms for effectively developing and designing codes. However, novice learners often struggle to understand basic computing concepts, such as variables, loops, arrays, conditionals, and functions. This is often caused by the invisibility of the computing mechanism and the complexity of language syntax and conventions. Moreover, challenges in learning computing concepts can be compounded for learners with atypical conditions (e.g. visual, cognitive, and learning impairment, attention deficit, and neurodivergence). To tackle this, teachers of typical ability learners frequently use notional machines (NMs) - simplified representations (e.g. diagrams, flow charts, and analogies) created to assist novice programmers in understanding abstract concepts, program execution, and dynamics. In addition, traditional learning activities may need assistive learning interventions (ALIs) and learner-oriented practices like physical tactile models, computing artifacts, and interactive learning tools. NM approaches tend to focus on the explanation of concepts from instructor to learner, while ALIs tend to focus on learner support in activities. Both methods can provide advantages for learning, and we expect that a combined approach would provide even greater synergy for all learners. However, little consideration has been given to how NM and ALI approaches could be effectively combined. This research investigates how NM and ALI can be effectively brought together more holistically as an inclusive pedagogical tool - notional machines for inclusive learning (NMIL). In this full paper, we develop the conceptualization of NMIL, grounded in previous NM and ALI research. We also propose a structured method for creating NMIL. Finally, we also develop a physical NMIL model, based on the structured NMIL creation method, to teach lists in Python, as part of an introductory computer science course."
10258248,Towards Data-Driving Multi-View Evaluation Framework for Scratch,"As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions."
10834323,"Impact of Enhanced Learning Approaches on STEM-Focused Education for School Children in Assam, India","In today's growing digital era, young students' emphasis on science and technology has multi-folded into the development of computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving mindset, and better learning outcomes. Traditionally, young children who tend to perform well academically are expected to become more successful in their careers rather than the skill set they learn and develop their cognition for better opportunities. On the contrary, skill set also plays a significant role in enhancing student engagement towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. Implementing educational robots and artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms as teaching tools represents a transformative approach to modern teaching methods. Incorporating a fun-based, hands-on learning environment using programming, designing, and problem-solving tasks for students to enhance their cognitive abilities can stimulate curiosity and innovation among them. The novelty of this study is that it analyses two case studies on introducing robotics and artificial intelligence among school children of rural-based schools in Assam, India, which enhances the participating students' self-efficacy, technical knowledge, and problem-solving attitude. This study aims to analyze the impact of an enhanced learning approach on school students regarding knowledge gain, self-worth, and innovative thinking compared to traditional teaching methods. Academicians from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati have been a part of the sessions provided to children. The data collection and analysis have been approved by the participants and their school teachers. A set of questions was developed to understand some knowledge-based and perception-based parameters through pre/post-tests and draw-a-robot activity. This study demonstrates positive effect sizes (cohen’s d = 1.64 and 5.41) from both case studies and statistic t-values to support the alternate hypothesis on a greater effect of implementing enhanced teaching methods for STEM education."
9511416,An Advanced Intrusion Detection System for IIoT Based on GA and Tree Based Algorithms,"The evolution of the Internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems, such as Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. These results were superior to existing IDS frameworks."
10190587,The Deep Sleep Optimizer: A Human-Based Metaheuristic Approach,"Owing to the no free lunch theorem, no single optimisation algorithm can solve all optimisation problems accurately, so new optimisation techniques are required. In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (DSO) is proposed. The deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test. Lastly, the DSO is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including GA, PSO, TLBO, and GWO. The DSO fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics."
10355908,Design and Performance Analysis of a Novel Hoop-Cut SPR-PCF Sensor for High Sensitivity and Broad Range Sensing Applications,"This article presents a systematic numerical investigation of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor based on photonic crystal fiber (PCF). The proposed design is modeled and simulated using the full-vectorial finite-element (FV-FEM) technique and sensing characteristics, such as confinement loss (CL) behaviors, phase matching, and sensitivity, which are investigated and presented. The plasmonic layer is made up of TiO2 and gold for improved sensitivity. The reported sensor exhibits an amplitude sensitivity of −374.062 RIU−1 and a wavelength sensitivity of 2000 nm/RIU for the refractive index (RI) sensing range of (1.39–1.44), according to the loss spectrum shift. The reported hoop-cut PCF-based SPR (HPCF-SPR) sensor is suitable for biosensing and chemical sensing applications because of its broad range (1.39–1.44) of analyte detection."
9889511,Promoting Children's Critical Thinking Towards Robotics through Robot Deception,"The need for critically reflecting on the deceptive nature of advanced technologies, such as social robots, is urging academia and civil society to rethink education and the skills needed by future generations. The promotion of critical thinking, however, remains largely unaddressed within the field of educational robotics. To address this gap and question if and how robots can be used to promote critical thinking in young children's education, we conducted an explorative design study named Bringing Shybo Home. Through this study, in which a robot was used as a springboard for debate with twenty 8- to 9-year-old children at school, we exemplify how the deceptive nature of robots, if embraced and magnified in order for it to become explicitly controversial, can be used to nurture children's critical mindset."
10287938,SecFedIDM-V1: A Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model With Blockchain and Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network,"Cloud computing is a technology for efficiently using computing infrastructures and a business model for selling computing resources and services. However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605. The SecFedIDM-V1 can be deployed alongside Firewalls in a federated cloud computing environment to reinforce the security of the infrastructure."
10319380,"Radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation exposure assessment, analysis, computation, and minimization technique in 5G networks: A perspective on QoS trade-offs","In this study, the specific absorption rate (SAR) and exposure index (EI) of access points (APs) and user equipment (UEs) in fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies are examined with regard to the effects of exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation and the implications of their reduction. We characterize the EI using a classical mathematical method while considering the power density, the SAR, the electric field strength, and the tissue's density and conductivity. As such, a novel exposure-index open-loop power control algorithm is proposed to evaluate the realistic RF-EMF radiation exposure on human users from both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication devices. To solve an EI minimization problem using the open-loop power control algorithm, we formulate it in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. As the energy capacity (i.e., power density) in wireless networks determines the radiation exposure (SAR and EI), it minimizes the EI by controlling and managing the transmitted and received powers under the restrictions of Quality of Service (QoS), interference, and power, while ensuring the users' QoS requirements are met. Our proposed scheme is numerically compared to other heuristic algorithms and exposure limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and other similar organizations. Lastly, we compare the emissions from 4G and 5G networks to the emissions from UL and DL transmissions. Our simulation findings indicate that our proposed technique is a good alternative. Our assessment, in terms of numerical results and evaluation, also verifies that the exposures are bearable, fall within the recommended limits, and are minimized without impairing the users' QoS."
10138574,Orbital Angular Momentum Mode Propagation and Supercontinuum Generation in a Soft Glass Bragg Fiber,"This manuscript presents a ring-core Bragg Fiber (RC-BF) for orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes propagation and supercontinuum generation. The proposed RC-BF is composed of alternating layers of soft glasses SF57 and LLF1 to render high nonlinearity to the fiber. Mode analysis using full-vectorial finite element method resulted in obtaining HE/EH modes to support vector modes as well as orbital angular momentum modes. The optimized fiber supports 22 OAM modes and exhibits a zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDW). The small effective area of Fiber 3 aided in achieving the highest nonlinearity,  $\gamma $  = 91.51  $\text{W}^{-1}$ km $^{-1}$ . A near-infrared supercontinuum is generated with a 35 dB flatness over a bandwidth of  $\sim $ 1087 - 2024 nm in a 20 cm long RC-BF using a chirp-free hyperbolic secant pulse of width 200 fs and peak power of 5 kW."
10309332,Age-Appropriate Robot Design: In-The-Wild Child-Robot Interaction Studies of Perseverance Styles and Robot’s Unexpected Behavior,"As child-robot interactions become more and more common in daily life environment, it is important to examine how robot’s errors influence children’s behavior. We explored how a robot’s unexpected behaviors affect child-robot interactions during two workshops on active reading: one in a modern art museum and one in a school. We observed the behavior and attitudes of 42 children from three age groups: 6-7 years, 8-10 years, and 10-12 years. Through our observations, we identified six different types of surprising robot behaviors: personality, movement malfunctions, inconsistent behavior, mispronunciation, delays, and freezing. Using a qualitative analysis, we examined how children responded to each type of behavior, and we observed similarities and differences between the age groups. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for designing age-appropriate learning interactions with social robots."
10189158,Can Quantum Computing Improve Uniform Random Sampling of Large Configuration Spaces?,"A software product line models the variability of highly configurable systems. Complete exploration of all valid configurations (the configuration space) is infeasible as it grows exponentially with the number of features in the worst case. In practice, few representative configurations are sampled instead, which may be used for software testing or hardware verification. Pseudo-randomness of modern computers introduces statistical bias into these samples. Quantum computing enables truly random, uniform configuration sampling based on inherently random quantum physical effects. We propose a method to encode the entire configuration space in a superposition and then measure one random sample. We show the method's uniformity over multiple samples and investigate its scale for different feature models. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of quantum computing for uniform random sampling regarding current and future quantum hardware."
10429782,Exploring Television White Space as an Alternative for Wireless Broadband Connectivity,"Advancement in wireless transmission has enabled the communication among multiple devices all over the world, as well as expanding the frontiers of wireless Internet access. As a result of these advancement, numerous devices are questing for wireless connectivity thereby congesting the existing spectrum. If new measures are not taken to reduce depletion of the reserved radio resource, new allocations of wireless Internet access will be impossible, thereby risking the development of the entire wireless ecosystem. The demands for resourceful spectrum consumption have continually driven researchers and stakeholders in the wireless industry to search for spare radio spectrum to offer affordable and reliable wireless connectivity. The TV broadcasting is not fully utilizing the spectrum in some geographical zone. These TV unused spaces called TV White Spaces (TVWS), are well-thought-out to be the probable future resolutions for unavailability of spectrum. The low frequency band (470 to 694 MHz) of the unutilized TV channel has exceptional broadcast features over extensive distances and enables transmissions through high-rise buildings, trees, and mountains. These features allow the applications of TVWS in Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor network, wireless connectivity, wireless switching, smart grid and cities, automated transportation, and logistics as well as connectivity in cloud infrastructure. This paper presents a study on the advantages and benefits of television white space as an alternative to wireless broadband connectivity."
10826039,EME33: A Dataset of Classical Piano Performances Guided by Expressive Markings with Application in Music Rendering,"Expressive performance in classical music plays a crucial role in shaping interpretations of musical pieces. However, existing datasets often provide limited attention to expressive markings in piano performances. This research addresses this gap by developing the Expressive Markings and Emotions 33 (EME33) dataset, which captures expressive piano performances in MIDI format, annotated with dynamic markings, expression markings, and additional emotional expressions. To validate the dataset’s applicability, we employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is suited to the size of our dataset, to render expressiveness in music. The results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in capturing and reproducing expressive performance, highlighting the potential of the EME33 dataset for future research in music information retrieval."
10512888,Metaheuristics for Protein Structure Prediction: Review and Empirical Analysis,"Metaheuristics have been employed in solving several optimization and NP-hard problems owing to their ability to avoid local optima entrapment, flexibility and robustness, simplicity, and reasonable computational time. In this work, an empirical analysis is carried out on the application of metaheuristics in solving the protein structure prediction (PSP) problem. The PSP problem entails predicting a three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins based on the amino acid sequences. This study employs the Ab Initio method, which relies on the thermodynamic properties of the proteins, such as the minimal free energy levels, bond angles, and torsional angles, in determining the protein structure. Five real protein sequences, namely 1CB3, 1BXL, 2H3S, 1TZ4, and 1CRN from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and 11 metaheuristics including DE, GA, PSO, DSO, ACO, and HS were employed in the empirical analysis. Moreover, extensive Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to generate the results of the empirical analysis and these results were statistically tested using the Friedman test."
10629693,Intra-Datacenter Load Balancing in a Federated Cloud with Throttled Algorithm,"The emergence of cloud computing technology has motivated a very high number of users in different organizations to access its services in running and delivering their various operations and services. However, this surge of cloud users has led to the problem of uneven load sharing among the cloud computing infrastructures. As a result, federated cloud infrastructure was initiated to provide more cloud computing resources to accommodate more cloud users’ requests and also to provide equal requests mapping with the available cloud resources. Nevertheless, the issue of unequal allocation of requests within the datacenter(s) that makes up the federated cloud environment still persists. This research work presents an intra-datacenter load balancing algorithm in a federated cloud environment named; the intra-balancer adapted throttled algorithm to evenly distribute requests in each datacenter that formulate the federated cloud infrastructures. The simulation of the intra-balancer was carried out in CloudAnalyst, the results of the implementation showed that the intra-balancer outperformed the Round-Robin and ESCE with 98.93ms and 2.26ms for the response and processing time respectively. The results assert that the intra-balancer algorithm provides a better load balancing solution in a federated cloud environment."
9172001,Education and Digital Transformation: The “Riconnessioni” Project,"Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools."
9273981,Machine learning for middle-schoolers: Children as designers of machine-learning apps,"This Research to Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a multidisciplinary, design-based research study that aims to develop and study pedagogical models and tools for integrating machine-learning (ML) topics into education. Although children grow up with ML systems, few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating ML and data-driven design in K-12 education to date. This paper presents the theoretical grounds for a design-oriented pedagogy and the results from exploring and implementing those theoretical ideas in practice through a case study conducted in Finland. We describe the overall process in which middle-schoolers (N = 34) co-designed and made ML applications for solving meaningful, everyday problems. The qualitative content analysis of the pre-and post-tests, student interviews, and the students' own ML design ideas indicated that co-designing real-life applications lowered the barriers for participating in some of the core practices of computer science. It also supported children in exploring abstract ML concepts and workflows in a highly personalized and embodied way. The article concludes with a discussion on pedagogical insights for supporting middle-schoolers in becoming innovators and software designers in the age of ML."
9127262,Coding Strip: A Pedagogical Tool for Teaching and Learning Programming Concepts through Comics,"The abstract nature of programming makes learning to code a daunting undertaking for many novice learners. In this work, we advocate the use of comics—a medium capable of presenting abstract ideas in a concrete, familiar way—for introducing programming concepts. Particularly, we propose a design process and related tools to help students and teachers create coding strips, a form of comic strips that are associated with a piece of code. We conducted two design workshops with students and high school computer science teachers to evaluate our design process and tools. We find that our design process and tools are effective at supporting the design of coding strips and that both students and teachers are excited about using coding strip as a tool for learning and teaching programming concepts."
9195777,The Best Laid Plans or Lack Thereof: Security Decision-Making of Different Stakeholder Groups,"Cyber security requirements are influenced by the priorities and decisions of a range of stakeholders. Board members and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) determine strategic priorities. Managers have responsibility for resource allocation and project management. Legal professionals concern themselves with regulatory compliance. Little is understood about how the security decision-making approaches of these different stakeholders contrast, and if particular groups of stakeholders have a better appreciation of security requirements during decision-making. Are risk analysts better decision makers than CISOs? Do security experts exhibit more effective strategies than board members? This paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a team's cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets. Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work."
9273959,Developing a Critical Robot Literacy for Young People from Conceptual Metaphors Analysis,"This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine. This can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions."
9125219,Visual block programming languages and their use in educational robotics,"Visual block programming environments can be defined as those programming environments that rely on objects rather than words to code the program. These types of environments are characterized by facilitating the task of the people who carry out the programs. This is mainly since they are more visually friendly. In addition, with this type of environment the person who makes the programs will not get the famous syntactic errors that characterize the programming tasks with textual programming languages. Along this paper, a set of tools commonly used in educational robotics are showed. Furthermore, a deep analysis in two of these tools are detailed. Additionally, some educational scenarios are detailed, as long as their relationship to students’ competencies and how to drive the scenarios in order to accomplish with the competencies. Finally, a study of the results from experience is included."
9286905,Teaching Networks to Digital Humanists,"Contribution: A technical course in a multidisciplinary university program has to provide high-level skills, with limited lecturing hours and student background. This article investigates the principles for its design and reports about a study case. Background: The overall course organization needs to address specific learning targets and teaching techniques, different from those used in traditional courses on the topic. Research Question: A stepwise strategy assists a principled design that allows dynamic, long-term improvements. Methodology: The evaluation of its applicability requires a years-long record of historical data. The article studies the evolution of a course over six years using simple monitoring techniques: surveys and rubric-based examinations. Findings: Monitoring emerges as an essential feature for course evolution: a focused examination provides the best results, while institutional, wide-spectrum surveys appear to be of little help."
9430399,Design of an educational multimedia library to teach Python to non-technical university students,"Starting from our teaching experience and previous research on programming for non-technical university students in Japan and Denmark, we identify an unarticulated dependency of programming materials from other technical domains, which causes a knowledge domain mismatch in learners. We approach this mismatch on two fronts: by defining a novel way to structure beginners courses that moves away from the classic bottom-up approach based on math-related problems, and instead leverages on multimedia as a motivational and powerful general-purpose domain to ground programming and scaffold its understanding; and via the design and implementation of new Python library that simplifies multimedia programming. We are currently organizing tests of both multimedia library and the new course structure in Japan and Denmark."
9368406,Raising Motivation of Programming Novices? Findings from a Controlled Laboratory Experiment Using Anki VectorTM Robots,"In order to strengthen the interest of students in the field of programming, robots are increasingly being used in courses of study with information technology content. This article describes the use of the robot Vector, manufactured by Anki, in a controlled laboratory experiment with undergraduate students. The aim of the research was to investigate the influence of robots on the motivation of programming beginners from the perspective of the students. The data of the study was collected using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. The subsequent analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and Chi2-tests. In addition, a computer-aided content analysis as well as a factor analysis was used as a second evaluation method. The research results showed a consistently positive influence of the Vector robot on the motivational behavior of the students. In particular, significant dependencies between the female gender and individual subcategories of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory could be demonstrated. The generalization of the research results is limited due to the small sample size and the exclusive participation of programming beginners."
9764109,STEM-Coding using Drones,"STEM learning from an early age is essential to confirm that students are prepared to meet the needs of the world they will inherit. Currently, there are incredible and inexpensive technologies to keep students engaged and passionate about their learning. A drone is a handson apparatus that could be incorporated in STEM for several learning applications such as class projects, experiments, and exploration. In this paper, the STEMcoding framework is designed for kids to learn coding using a drone and Scratch programming. This platform attempts to visualize their coding by drone while Scratch makes a gaming environment to enhance their programming using block-based learning. The platform has applied in a STEM event at the University of Wisconsin Platteville and the results show the benefit of utilizing drone in STEM-coding as follows: i) transforms abstract concepts into concrete learning, ii) delivers an entertaining and motivating learning environment, iii) combines STEM theory with practice, and iv) provides a hand-on skill which is dynamic and attractive."
9272418,NYC CS4All: An Early Look at Teacher Implementation in One Districtwide Initiative,"Computer science for all initiatives have broadened the participation of students enrolled in elective computer science (CS) courses and introduced compulsory CS instruction in many areas of the United States. However, there is a shortage of K-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach CS. To build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only CS content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. In this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple CS professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. The teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement CS. Though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for CS education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing CS, in a large, urban school system. The results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS instruction (even in a district where CS education is a priority). They also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. These differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing CS for all initiatives."
9454149,Using Augmented Reality in programming learning: A systematic mapping study,"Coding skills have become the new language of communication for the tech world. At an educational level, applying the concepts and logic of programming is a complex task for the student. The investigation of this problem was carried out with the intention of knowing if there are tools that could help the student understand programming by using augmented reality technology. For this purpose, a systematic mapping study was carried out to identify, filter and classify the information through a query applied in different ways of research. As a result, 34 articles were selected and classified. The main results show that: a) programming learning is not limited in terms of the student's age; b) Augmented reality has potential advantages in programming learning; c) Due to the extensive content of the programming, applications focused on specific topics were found according to the level of studies; d) The software used in the development of AR applications, mostly uses Unity with Vuforia; and, e) Augmented reality contributes to different learning techniques and styles that improve the way information is perceived and visualized. In conclusion, augmented reality technology has proven to have positive consequences in the programming learning process, providing a starting point for the development of a tool that contributes to the programming learning based on the characteristics found and analyzed in this document."
9648320,Massive Remote School Trips: A Case Study,"During the height of the CoViD-19 pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, schools throughout Europe have been closed for several months, leaving teachers with the responsibility of providing distance learning through video conferencing and remote-presence systems, while parents were scrambling for appropriate tools and support. School outings have also suffered from the limited mobility of students given by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. In this paper we present a set of technologies developed to reproduce the school trip experience, allowing students to stay at home or in school and requiring only a Web browser and Internet access, while integrating communication tools that allow participants to actively be engaged in interactive lessons and educational experiences. In 2020 the tool has been used during the “CodyTrip” event, a two-day visit to the town of Urbino, attended by more than 15.000 students, followed up with a series of events in 2021 with over 115.000 participants. Results from the pilot events show very high engagement and demonstrate the feasibility of organizing online visiting experiences with massive participation without compromising the perceived interactivity of the proposed activities, which can be equally engaging for different audience demographics. Findings also suggest that this solution may be adopted not only as a contingent substitute for traveling during the pandemic, but as an effective tool to widen the scope and appeal of cultural tourism."
9249431,Empirical Evidence of the Usage of Programming Languages in the Educational Process,"Contribution: A systematic literature review on the empirical evidence regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is presented. The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts."
9637325,SE-First: A New Approach to Software Engineering Education,"In this Innovative Practice Full Paper, we note that the way software is developed has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Software developers today cannot just be good at writing code; they must also possess non-technical skills in order to work successfully within diverse teams and have an appreciation for the tools and processes needed to build and maintain complex systems. In this work, we describe a novel first-year Software Engineering-First (SE-First) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. To assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. We assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. Initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a D or F course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program."
9378110,Computational Treatments to Recover Erased Heritage: A Legacy of Slavery Case Study (CT-LoS),"Graduate students at the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies (UMD iSchool) collaborated in interdisciplinary teams on a case study to explore application of computational methodologies to datafied collections related to slavery in the Maryland State Archives (MSA). Two research questions were examined: (1) What are the opportunities and limitations for using computational methods and open source tools to characterize data encoded within records of enslavement and to discover new patterns and relationships in that data? (2) How does knowledge of social and cultural systems impact those opportunities and limitations? Computational methods and tools were most effectively used when socio-cultural contextualization and technology's role as a mediator of representation were taken into account. Three additional technical research areas are identified to enhance recovery of heritage hidden in records of enslavement: visualization, graph databases, and ontologies and metadata."
9653337,Use of Techno-Pedagogical Tools to Incorporate Remote Collaboration in a Data Structure Course,"Traditionally, teaching-learning activities in typical schools in most of the states in the Mexican Republic have been face-to-face interactions between students and learning facilitators, but obviously, in 2020, everything changed, so that educational videoconferencing will gain ground in the academic world. Participation in solving individual and / or group problems was adapted to a remote scheme, stimulating the use of different skills in students to face the new normal, as is the case in the development of remote programming projects for the purpose of training novice programmers to solve problems collaboratively, going through the entire global software development process. To do so, it is necessary to incorporate skills that allow them to adapt this work philosophy, which is why in this work the use of competencies that allows to detonate social and cognitive aspects in the development of software in small teams was evaluated, as well as the frequency of use. It is also important to determine if the gender has any influence on the adoption of a certain trait. For this, groups of students were trained by developing computational problems in the field of data structure."
9766752,Practical UML Programming based on the Executable UML Method at Secondary School Students,"This study aims to explore educational methods for conceptual modeling for novices. The subjects of this study are primarily Grade 9 students in secondary school who are enrolled in compulsory education. This study relies heavily on model-driven development (MDD) and a domain-specific language (DSL). Using MDD, learners are not asked to write code, but rather to create a model to evaluate their model by observing the behavior of the target device. Teachers can control the difficulty of the problems assigned to their students by using a DSL. In this study, we describe our research approach using MDD and a DSL and then show our experiment design and results. We also discuss the qualitative and qualitative effectiveness of UML programming in Technology class for Grade 9 students."

9453972,Developing a Real World Escape Room for Assessing Preexisting Debugging Experience of K12 Students,"Debugging code is a central skill in learning to program. Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom have to take learners' preexisting experience into account. Students' preexisting debugging experience is built through troubleshooting, where they frequently find and fix errors in their daily lives - before they learn to program - for example when repairing their bicycle or if “the internet” stops working. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing preexisting debugging experience in the form of a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting tasks. This allows us to observe students' troubleshooting process, strategies, and overall behavior in a natural environment and thus assess preexisting debugging experience. To this end, a design-based research process was conducted and a real-world escape room consisting of various troubleshooting tasks was developed. Those tasks and the escape room setting provide an innovative methodological approach to study students troubleshooting behavior and assess their preexisting debugging experience."
10481204,Developing a Knowledge-Requirements Engineering Framework towards Transformative Metaverses/(Eco)Systems/Ecologies,"Sustainability and circular economy are promoted by the UNSDGs. However, UNEP has suggested localization prior to development, and harmonization, to aggregate impacts across spatial scales and across different taxonomic groups, applicable to all resources, to address emergent crosscutting issues across regions and models. This study posits that based on design thinking, sustainable investing/asset management theory needs to be situated within societal needs, to cater to differentiated needs, diverse capability maturity levels, and different flavours of reuse. Thus, instantiating from the Knowledge-Requirements Engineering frameworks, this study aims to review, simplify and localize sustainable investing concepts. To cater to different scenarios, a Knowledge-Requirements Engineering-Lifecycle Thinking-Innovation Helixes framework is proposed; intertwining expansive framing and UNEP's intrinsic value, pivoting via instrumental values, localized to cultural values, analogical to online shopping drivers, to enhance absorptive/ multiplicative/ relational capacity/capability, transformative innovations, across SDGs. Hopefully, the framework can interconnect/recommend/transform metaverses/ (eco)systems/ ecologies/assets more reflectively, effectively and efficiently."

10343081,Math+CS: Comparing Teaching Candidates in a Methods Course and Pre-Service Teachers in a Math and Technology Course,"While governments, teacher educators, and teachers recognize the importance of introducing computer science (CS) in K-12, there is limited understanding about when the teacher preparation should start and how it needs to be done. Furthermore, with the rapid expansion of digital technology in our society and the way it affects our lives, new educational frameworks for better teacher preparation have been developed, such as TPACK and CTIntegration, that situate new technologies and their role in education to meet the new societal demands. There is a larger body of research in Mathematics on how on how to prepare teachers to teach than in CS. This study explores how graduate teaching candidates and undergraduate pre-service teachers engage with Math+CS modules differently. We were interested in the similarities and differences in the way senior-level pre-service teachers in a mathematics and technology class and graduate-level teacher candidates in a methods class interact with Math+CS integrated modules. Working with the concepts of variable, input, and output, we investigated which knowledge domains were leveraged among groups in different classes, what connections they make between the concepts in math and CS, and their uncertainty. The results indicated that there was a difference in the way the teaching candidates in their methods class approached the computational modules than the pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers focused more on developing their CS content knowledge, and the teacher candidates were interested in making connections between their knowledge domains, reflecting on how their students would think about the concepts in math, expressing more concerns, and asking more questions to develop their TPACK."
10707923,Empowering Elementary Students' Scratch Programming Skills Through a Jigsaw Collaborative Learning Method in a Metaverse Virtual Space,"This study designs a jigsaw collaborative learning method in a metaverse virtual space (JCLM-MVS) to promote learning performance and CT in Scratch programming. This study used a quasi-experimental research method with 48 fifth-grade students from two classes in Taiwan's elementary school as the research participants. One class of 24 students was randomly assigned to the experimental group using JCLM-MVS to conduct Scratch programming learning, whereas the other class of 24 students was assigned to the control group using the traditional teacher-centered teaching method. The study found that the experimental group of learners showed significantly better learning performance than the control group. Although the results showed no statistically significant difference in overall and most dimensions of CT between the two groups, both learning approaches were found to promote CT effectively."

In the methodological process of this study, 5 stages were proposed: research questions, search, selection, quality assessment and synthesis extraction. In this way, 5 guiding questions were drawn, 136 articles generated by the search stage were analyzed and the synthesis of 55 documents that met the criteria of this research was concluded, thus compiling the different practices used for the development of algorithmic thinking. In addition, as a result of the systematic literature mapping, a definition of Algorithmic Thinking oriented Software Engineering and didactics is proposed."
10386566,Accelerating Precision Research and Resolution Through Computational Archival Science Pedagogy,"Use of archival collections is accelerated by the presence of finding aids, which communicate the arrangement and description of collection contents. To arrive at the optimal arrangement of a collection, archivists rely on some item-level processing or knowledge gained by exploring and manipulating digital reproductions of the contents. In this paper we consider archival student and instructor perspectives from hands-on course experiences directly with two distinct collections: one pertaining to the development, 2017 transfer and launch, and ongoing maintenance of the International Research Portal for Records Related to Nazi-Era Cultural Property (IRP2), and one a selection of unclassified catalog entries about digitized nuclear science reports. Visualizing is a data practice that permits the discovery of key content patterns, identification of computational models to be carried out to aid further analysis, and query-resolution for subject experts with precise - and historically significant - research questions. While archival data visualizations have previously been implemented as an extension of descriptive work including finding aid element counts, here we connect visualization to the work of archival outreach and access. We study how visualizations generated by groups of students working with textual and numerical dataset portions can ultimately accelerate time-sensitive uses of collections."
9637399,"Design, Implementation, and Assessment of Synchronized Worldwide Online Robotics Competitions for Engineering and Computing Education","The work presented in this Full Paper is categorized as Innovative Practice, as per FIE guidelines. Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019–2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique “synchronized” online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach & judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years. Additionally, 95 % of students surveyed after the ROWC exposure said that they would now consider a career involving STEM versus 91 % of students surveyed after the 2019 in-person competitions."
9894608,Sandwich robot: how non-programmers solve computational problems,"We are investigating how non-programmers make sense and solve simple computational problems. We developed a game where a robot has to assemble a sandwich, collecting a specific list of ingredients. Our game follows principles and offers game mechanics typical of games for learning programming. The main innovation of our game is that it visualizes the generality property of algorithms through double levels, that we call twin-worlds, in which one same algorithm is executed by two robots in assembling their sandwiches. Results from early testing with university students enrolled in the education of Media Studies show that the game is usable, levels can be solved at various degrees of complexity (e.g. with and without using loops), and that the students were able to make sense of our twin-worlds levels and formulate general algorithms for both worlds. However, the gathered feedback also highlights the need to explore alternative implementations of the twin-worlds concept."

10578766,Development of Academic Projects with Robotics for Social Support: Initiatives of Mexican engineering Students,"In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, marked by the proliferation of artificial intelligence and robotics, the role of engineering education stands as a cornerstone of sustainable progress. Recognizing this imperative, engineering curricula are increasingly incorporating a competency-based approach that reflects the complexities of the real world, for lifelong learning, using enabling and disruptive technologies such as humanoid robotics. We present a case study from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus, where NAO robots are used in social projects with immediate impact in the fields of health and education, addressing sustainable development objectives. This research shows projects that have had a significant social impact in different communities in Mexico, in the areas of education and health with innovative solutions that motivate and engage the attention of the audience. A group of students from different engineering careers design, develop and implement application scenarios for the accompaniment and social appropriation of challenges such as: the incorporation of girls in STEM areas, support for groups with intellectual disabilities, dissemination and knowledge of sign language and dissemination of the cultural heritage of Xochimilco as a cultural heritage of humanity. Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies. Evidence and results of the involvement of undergraduate students in social scenarios are shown, showing that, by integrating these elements, engineering programs aspire to train professionals capable of harnessing their technical knowledge for the general good of society as well as the perception of the participants and audiences reached."
OZMUTLU2021100833,Collaboration and engagement based coding training to enhance children’s computational thinking self-efficacy,"Although there are different definitions for computational thinking in the literature, it is possible to define it mainly as problem solving, designing and interpreting new systems by thinking like a computer. According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question. Analyses of the pre, post and delayed tests revealed significant differences between the pre and post-tests."
KOREN2023101240,Using design-based implementation research approach to create computational thinking assessment tools for youth programs in public libraries,"Methodological innovations across social sciences are opening new avenues for conducting research designed to address real-world challenges. The benefits of utilizing the Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) approach in public libraries to resolve a persistent problem of practice, a lack of assessment tools to evaluate youth Computational Thinking (CT) programs, is demonstrated. Findings from a three-year, three-phased study utilizing the DBIR approach to design and implement a suite of assessment tools to assess CT programming in public libraries are presented. Guided by the four principles of the DBIR approach, this research produced new knowledge, including identifying CT program outcomes, challenges, and recommendations for designing and implementing assessment tools to measure the impact of public libraries' CT programming. Findings underscore the DBIR approach as a strategy for engaging with practitioners and helping shift their perspectives by resolving practice problems and facilitating the design of sustainable solutions."
CHEN2024101995,"The interplay of rewards and competition in digital game-based learning: Effects on intrinsic motivation, game performance and behaviors, and computational thinking","Although there is controversy surrounding rewards and competition in education, they are key elements in digital game-based learning (DGBL). Research on the influence of rewards and competition in DGBL often yields mixed results, suggesting a need to investigate individual game elements and their interactions. This study implemented DGBL focusing on computational thinking (CT) in 7th-grade classes. Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance. Implications are drawn for DGBL research and practice."
NA2024100650,Validating a performance assessment of computational thinking for early childhood using item response theory,"Despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (CT), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers."
XU2022101041,Relations of computational thinking to reasoning ability and creative thinking in young children: Mediating role of arithmetic fluency,"Computational thinking (CT) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education."

Ensuring equitable access to CT depends on preparing teachers to integrate CT into disciplinary curricula. We report on the design, evaluation, and outcomes of the Computational Thinking Unplugged for Science (CT-UP-S) professional development program for inservice science teachers. Our process-based approach to CT significantly improved teachers CT understanding and CT/science integration self-efficacy by systematically linking CT practices to scaffold the generation of unplugged algorithms. Additionally, we found that the process-based approach provided a framework for teachers' lesson planning and that teachers’ content knowledge moderated their ability to write CT-integrated science lessons."
BERSON202357,An exploration of robot programming as a foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking in preschoolers’ guided play,"Early evidence suggests that robot programming offers an important foundation for spatial reasoning and computational thinking; however, researchers have debated how to introduce young children to these skills. We explored how preschoolers develop understanding of spatial concepts and computational thinking as the children took turns navigating a path during guided play with a programmable robot. Our analysis of the data included a multimodal visualization of the exchanges between the teacher, children, and a programmable robotic device. The findings highlight the effects that arose from the physical-digital convergence of technology integrated into play including: (a) the robot evoked a chain of actions, enacting pedagogic forces that transformed children's learning; (b) children used their own bodies as spatial referents, co-locating themselves in space with the robot; (c) the teacher remained a key actor, providing verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to promote children's understanding and mastery of spatial and computational concepts; and (d) talking with the teacher about spatial concepts combined with the interactions with the robot enhanced children's acquisition of spatial ideas relative to the quantity of children's verbal expressions and complexity of their applied spatial skills and computational thinking."
ANGELI2022100329,The effects of scaffolded programming scripts on pre-service teachers’ computational thinking: Developing algorithmic thinking through programming robots,"Workers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics play a significant role in the sustained growth and stability of the global economy, and, thus constitute a critical component in helping all countries worldwide to prosper. In this context, computational thinking constitutes an important skill to have as it enables workers to develop creative solutions to complex problems. Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course. The results show statistically significant learning gains in pre-service teachers’ algorithmic thinking and debugging skills in the context of robotic programming activities with LEGO WeDo. Limitations and future research directions are discussed."
KONG2024105126,Dynamic interplays between self-regulated learning and computational thinking in primary school students through animations and worksheets,"Recent studies identify Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within Computational Thinking (CT) literature. However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education."
HOLSTEIN2025101772,Scratch teachers' perceptions of teaching computational thinking with school subjects in a constructionist approach,"In recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into elementary schools. However, few studies have focused on teachers’ perceptions. This study aims to examine teachers' perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development. By addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice."
SUHERMAN2024101591,Role of creative self-efficacy and perceived creativity as predictors of mathematical creative thinking: Mediating role of computational thinking,"In the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. Thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. The participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 % female; 47.1 % male) in Indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. For analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. Based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. In addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. As for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. The findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century."
WANG2025101729,Cognitive foundations in the interplay between computational thinking and creativity: A scoping review,"Previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (CT) and creativity. However, a consensus has yet to be reached since both CT and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. To uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between CT and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 2006–2024. Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. Although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both CT and creativity, their contributions to the CT-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. Future research should explore the CT-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience."
LEE2022102008,Computer science education and K-12 students’ computational thinking: A systematic review,"This systematic review examined how computer science (CS) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students’ computational thinking (CT). Sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools and its impact on the development of students’ CT skills. Although educational interventions have not always been successful in CS education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, CS education promotes the development of students’ CT in the K-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. We recommend early access to CS education, various innovative instructional approaches to CS education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning."
SUN2024101542,Comparative experiment of the effects of unplugged and plugged-in programming on computational thinking in primary school students: A perspective of multiple influential factors,"Recently, the development of computational thinking (CT) skills has become widespread in the whole world. There is a consensus to develop students’ CT skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. However, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. This study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing CT skills of students in Grades 1-2 students. It also explored the joint effects of students’ gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on CT skills. The quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 Grades 1-2 students. The results found that unplugged programming promoted CT skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. We found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in CT skills than in plugged-in group. Moreover, the improvement of CT skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. However, these were not observed in plugged-in group. The results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching CT skills to early primary school students and provide references for CT education."
SCHLAUCH2025100704,More than words: Conceptualizing narrative computational thinking based on a multicase study,"This paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. We identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. The latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. By applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. Our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context."
SEN2021100931,Computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the engineering design process: The case of robotics and 3D robot modeling,"In this study, it is aimed to identify the computational thinking skills used by gifted and talented students in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP. The case study design, a qualitative research method, is employed in the study. The participants consist of gifted and talented students attending the Science and Arts Center. Integrated STEM activities based on the EDP were conducted over the course of ten weeks and among these activities, robotic and 3D modeling-based robot construction activities using Lego sets are addressed in the present study. The STEM activity booklet, researchers' fieldnotes, and teaching process video recordings were used as data collection tools in the study. Data that was collected was analyzed through content analysis. It was seen that gifted and talented students participating in integrated STEM activities based on the EDP make active use of critical thinking skills while providing explanations, making associations, questioning information, giving justifications, solving problems, thinking creatively, making generalizations, and attempting to convince others; as for the instances of defining problems, creating solutions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution, the students were observed to actively use their problem-solving skills. The detailed account provided by the study on the way robotic and 3D robot modeling activities improve the computational thinking skills of gifted and talented students contributes to the required educational support and to the existing body of literature."
ZHANG2024105039,A metaphor-based robot programming approach to facilitating young children’s computational thinking and positive learning behaviors,"In the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young children's computational thinking (CT) has sparked tremendous attention. Programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop CT. However, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract CT concepts. As a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. Therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach and explored its impact on young children's CT and behavioral patterns. A total of 118 children aged 5–6 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (MRP) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (CRP) approach. Results revealed that children who adopted the MRP approach outperformed children who adopted the CRP approach on CT. In addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed MRP approach could facilitate children's superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. Accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and CT development for young children."
WANG2023101269,The role of computer supported project-based learning in students’ computational thinking and engagement in robotics courses,"Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill for students. It is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, how to improve students’ CT in robotics is still to be explored. Hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (CSPBL) on students’ CT and learning engagement through comparing students’ CT and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with CSPBL). Participants were seventy-nine students from a university in China. Questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students’ CT and learning engagement. The comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the CSPBL enhanced students’ CT. The simulation project training based on the SenseStudy learning platform in CSPBL helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. The CSPBL also improved students’ engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. It was found that the CSPBL was effective in terms of improving students’ CT and engagement in robotics learning. This study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction."
UNG2022104379,Computational thinking for teachers: Development of a localised E-learning system,"Malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits. Results demonstrate that myCTGWBL could be used to guide future planning when establishing CT knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers."
WU2024105012,Enhancing English writing and higher-order thinking skills through computational thinking,"Efforts to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. The CT concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. Additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost English writing creativity."
SUN2025101852,Comparative study of codecombat-based python programming and scratch programming effects on sixth graders' Computational thinking: interaction effects of gender and programming experience,"Text-based Python and block-based Scratch programming have received significant attention in primary school computational thinking (CT) education. However, few studies have compared the differences between CodeCombat-based Python and Scratch programming approaches and knowledge of their relative effectiveness is lacking. This study aimed to explore differences in the impact of CodeCombat-based Python and Scratch programming on sixth grade students’ CT. The influence of students’ gender and programming experience was also considered. Therefore, we conducted an 11-week quasi-experimental study with 87 students. They were divided into two groups to participate in CodeCombat-based Python and Scratch programming teaching activities respectively. The results showed that both CodeCombat-based Python and Scratch programming activities significantly improved students’ CT skills, but Python programming had more effective and sustained effects on students' CT development. We also found that Scratch programming eliminated differences in CT from programming experience. In contrast, CodeCombat-based Python programming amplified the influence of programming experience and benefitted the CT development of students with programming experience. More interestingly, there was no gender difference in students’ CT in the Python group, but there were significant interaction effects between gender and programming experience. We found that girls with programming experience improved significantly more in CT than boys with programming experience, breaking gender stereotypes in CT. This study enriches researchers’ and frontline teachers’ understanding of CodeCombat-based Python and Scratch programming and provides empirical evidence for future teaching approach choices."
MACCALLUM2025105056,Integrating computational thinking through digital creation: The (TPAC)2K model,"This study investigates how teachers adapt their technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) to integrate computational thinking (CT) across diverse subjects, addressing the challenge of moving students from passive technology users to active creators. Using a participatory action research design, data were collected from 12 high school teachers through reflective journals, lesson plans, and interviews. Using framework analysis, the findings reveal the need for professional development, scaffolding, and interdisciplinary collaboration to support CT integration. The study introduces the (TPAC)2K model, providing a framework for fostering student creativity through digital artefact creation, with implications for teacher training and cross-curricular teaching practices."
SU2023100122,A systematic review of integrating computational thinking in early childhood education,"Computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. However, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. This systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education."
KONG2025105281,A latent profile analysis of teachers’ knowledge about and perceived usefulness of computational thinking and how teacher profiles relate to student achievement,"Teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers' latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT."
ROBLEDOCASTRO2023102329,Effect of COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training on executive functions in children aged 9 to 11: Protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial,"We designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on children's executive functions. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a TAU control group. With three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. The participants will be children aged 9 to 11. The allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. The sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. The primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. Secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. The experimental group will participate in the COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training designed by the first author. The training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. The TAU control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. The evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. The investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations."
YOUJUN2024101624,Relieving negative Chinese transfer in EFL syntactic writing through negative feedback based on computational thinking,"Negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative Chinese transfer (NCT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that EFL writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education."
MENDOZADIAZ2023e18997,Effective teaching in computational thinking: A bias-free alternative to the exclusive use of students’ evaluations of teaching (SETs),"The tenure system in the United States places significant importance on teaching effectiveness. To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized."
BROZA2023101285,“Start from scratch”: Integrating computational thinking skills in teacher education program,"In the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. As a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named ""Play with me in Code"" to develop pre-service teachers' (PSTs) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. Study's conclusions relate to the importance of providing PSTs opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future."
CHEN2023101224,Visualising trends in computational thinking research from 2012 to 2021: A bibliometric analysis,"Using the analytical tool CiteSpace, this review study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the characteristics of 249 studies on Computational Thinking (CT) indexed in the Web of Science from 2012 to 2021. The multi-dimensional analytical approach provided a holistic view of the scope of CT research and its progression,and enabled the major topics, themes, disciplinary domains, and prominent authors, institutes, countries/regions, and papers to be identified. Based on the general descriptive data analysis, the results showed that CT has gained increasing influence as a field of research over the past decade. A clustering analysis of the retrieved keywords showed that the development of CT in K-12 education was the most frequently discussed topic. The co-occurrence knowledge maps identified the 11 main research themes and their progress. The research was from a wide spectrum of disciplines including education, science education, computer science, interdisciplinary application, psychology, engineering, and information systems. The highest co-citations were found in the journals of Communication of the ACM, Computers and Education, and Computers in Human Behaviors. The researchers, institutes, and countries/regions that have made the most significant contributions to CT research and the 10 most highly cited CT studies were also identified. Overall, the findings of this review study indicate the paths for future research on developing CT in the classroom."
CHENG2023104794,Enhancing student's computational thinking skills with student-generated questions strategy in a game-based learning platform,"Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities."
PEREZ2023312,"CT for equity: situating computational thinking, computer science, and social justice in a math and science teacher education program","Teacher preparation programs currently struggle to (a) address the challenges preparing students to use computing principles, and (b) do so in ways that apply a critical lens toward societal inequities. In this paper, we describe our (1) integrated STEM and computational thinking (CT) teacher preparation program; (2) response to barriers educators face in preparing students to critically use computing principles; and (3) examples of the pedagogical practices teacher candidates developed through the program. We contribute an approach to preparing and empowering educators to support students understanding and use of CT as a lens for advocating for social justice in their lives."
CELIK2023102026,"Exploring the Determinants of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Literacy: Digital Divide, Computational Thinking, Cognitive Absorption","To effectively utilize artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies such as ChatGPT and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about AI. Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies."
ISRAELFISHELSON2022104353,Studying interrelations of computational thinking and creativity: A scoping review (2011–2020),"Both computational thinking (CT) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for today's learners. Over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. In this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. Doing so may build a bridge between CT and creativity in a way that will benefit both."
ODGAARD2023100598,Who programs whom?—Computational empowerment through mastery and appropriation in young children’s computational thinking activities,"This paper sheds light on 3–5-year-old children’s enactments of computational empowerment (CE) in activities with computational thinking (CT). CT is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in today’s digitized societies. Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. The paper concludes that children’s various enactments of CE deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of CT in kindergartens."
JOHNLEMAY2021100056,Instructional interventions for computational thinking: Examining the link between computational thinking and academic performance,"Teaching computational thinking (CT) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. Recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning CT can improve student academic performance. In fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of CT. However, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between CT skills and academic performance. In the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported CT skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a Southwestern American university. We found few direct relationships between CT skills and academic performance. We only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. Our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. The findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students’ learning and learning outcomes. We discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including CT and instructional alignment in school curricula. Our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between CT skills and academic performance in higher education."
HU202381,Scaffolding young children's computational thinking with teacher talk in a technology-mediated classroom,"Although studies have shown that computational thinking (CT) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold children's CT processes in a technology-mediated learning context. This exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the CT of three children (6 to 8 years old). Seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). Statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. After a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. Following a teacher's open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. In response to a teacher's rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. These results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold children's CT processes."
YILMAZ2023100147,"The effect of generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool use on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy and motivation","ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard."
KOPCHA2023100156,Children's computational thinking as the development of a possibility space,"In this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how children's computational thinking develops as a process. Drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how children's computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. We then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. The findings lend support for approaching children's computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. The findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. Implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed."
HOOSHYAR2024122283,ImageLM: Interpretable image-based learner modelling for classifying learners’ computational thinking,"Predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. This research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for Image-based Learner Modelling (ImageLM) using CNNs and transfer learning to model learners’ performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. The approach integrates Grad-CAM, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. Findings show that our custom CNN outperforms other models (namely ResNet, VGG, and Inception), with 83% accuracy in predicting solution correctness. More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle."
SUN2022101043,The bidirectional predictions between primary school students’ STEM and language academic achievements and computational thinking: The moderating role of gender,"In the era of artificial intelligence, computational thinking (CT) has become a key skill that digital citizens should possess in the 21st century. There has already been a popular research trend to integrate CT into school curriculum, especially in the STEM field. However, there are still limited large scale research studies on the bidirectional relationships between primary schoolers’ STEM academic achievement and CT skills, and so is language academic achievement, especially with the longitudinal research methods. This study adopted correlation analysis and cross-lagged regression analysis in a longitudinal study to separately explore the bidirectional predictive effect of STEM academic achievement, language academic achievement, and CT skills of 1,487 Chinese primary school students in grades 4–6 (11–12 years old), and explored the moderating role of gender. The results showed that there were significant bidirectional predictions between students’ STEM and language academic achievements and CT skills, which further confirmed the feasibility and advantages of integrating CT in STEM and language subjects. In addition, gender only played a moderating role in the predictions of students’ CT skills on their language academic achievement. Implications for reducing the gender differences in STEM and CT fields are also discussed. The research results will provide references to integrating CT into the curriculum of basic education and improving the development of primary school students’ CT skills and promoting STEM teaching practice."
HU2024101653,Unplugged activities in the elementary school mathematics classroom: The effects on students’ computational thinking and mathematical creativity,"The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities’ influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students’ CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students’ mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students’ interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum."
YANG2023101218,The impact of story-inspired programming on preschool children's computational thinking: A multi-group experiment,"Computational thinking (CT) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. With the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ECE), many ECE researchers and practitioners tend to link CT to programming. However, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. This multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and CT for preschool children. Building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (N=108) were involved in nine weeks of CT learning via one of the three conditions: Story-Inspired Robot Programming (SIRP), Story-Inspired Tablet Programming (SITP), and unplugged CT education. Results revealed that children who participated in the SIRP and SITP conditions showed improved CT scores, relative to unplugged CT education, even after controlling for baseline CT scores. No gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. These findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable CT learning experiences."
BARKELA2024100463,Do student teachers experience self-worth threats in computational thinking?,"Theory
The successful implementation of computational thinking into primary schools requires that primary school teachers feel safe and confident in teaching this topic to young learners. However, many student teachers face low expectancy of success and heightened anxiety towards computational thinking. Self-worth theory suggests that this may lead to a self-worth threat and in consequence to engagement in self-protective behaviours, hampering the successful acquisition of skills needed to implement computational thinking into their future classrooms.
Aims
This study aims to investigate potential self-worth threats as amplifiers of student teachers’ resistance to engage in computational thinking.
Method
323 student teachers participated in the study. Participants filled out a questionnaire on expectancy of success and anxiety towards computational thinking, and rated how likely they were to engage in self-protective behaviours, i.e., self-handicapping, avoiding novelty, and academic cheating, when learning about computational thinking at the start of the semester.
Results
Students showed heightened levels of anxiety and low levels of expectancy towards computational thinking. Further, they reported that they would be likely to engage in self-protective behaviours. A structural equation model showed that anxiety towards computational thinking was positively related to self-protective behaviours. Moreover, expectancy had a negative indirect effect via anxiety towards computational thinking on self-protective behaviours.
Discussion
Student teachers might experience self-worth threats when learning about computational thinking and engage in self-protective behaviours that might hamper their success. Our findings caution the impact of possible self-worth threats on teaching methods, thus influencing children's learning in the 21st century."
TUCKERRAYMOND2021104284,Science teachers can teach computational thinking through distributed expertise,"Content area K-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. The purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. In the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three US school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. We conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, Building Systems from Scratch. Analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers’ orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. We identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students’ independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. Findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms."
GEROSA2021100043,Cognitive abilities and computational thinking at age 5: Evidence for associations to sequencing and symbolic number comparison,"Computational thinking (CT) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. Despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between CT and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. Understanding CT from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. In the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. Mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with CT as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. A subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their CT assessments. Results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of CT in kindergarten. Positive significant associations between robot programming and CT performance are reported."
ROBLEDOCASTRO2025103145,"Exploring computational thinking, executive functions, visuospatial skills and experiences with toys in early childhood: Protocol for a controlled trial","The research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. The study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. Participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. The intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called ROVERSA and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. To assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the Flanker task, the NIH Toolbox Card Sorting Test, the Corsi Block Test, the NEPSY-II Mental Rotation Test, the Pyramid of Mexico from the ENI-2 battery, and the Computational Thinking Test (CTt). Data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through ANOVA-MR, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. It is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children."
SAHIN2024101439,"STEM professional development program for gifted education teachers: STEM lesson plan design competence, self-efficacy, computational thinking and entrepreneurial skills","This study examined the impact of a 10-month STEM professional development (PD) program on 25 teachers working with gifted students. The program aimed to enhance pedagogical knowledge and competencies. Findings indicated significant positive improvements in teachers' STEM self-efficacy, computational thinking, and entrepreneurship skills. The PD program also had a direct positive influence on the quality of lesson plans. The study suggests that effective PD design should incorporate scientific inquiry, engineering design processes, computational thinking, entrepreneurship skills, and the development of teachers' self-efficacy for successful implementation of PD outcomes in STEM education."
COBAN2021100929,An alternative approach for measuring computational thinking: Performance-based platform,"Educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. Considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature."
YANG2023324,Beyond computing: Computational thinking is associated with sequencing ability and self-regulation among Chinese young children,"Computing education has progressively entered into children's early years. Due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (CT) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. Our findings suggest that CT may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing."
DONG2025104824,Effects of digital badges on pupils' computational thinking and learning motivation in computer science,"Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. Developing students' CT in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. Meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students' learning motivation in computer science (CS). However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS. These findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students' CT and learning motivation."
ROBLEDOCASTRO2023100563,Effects of a computational thinking intervention program on executive functions in children aged 10 to 11,"Computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. A growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. In recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. The current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. In this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. The instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes BANFE-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. The experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. The results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area."
MASTER2023242,Gender equity and motivational readiness for computational thinking in early childhood,"Learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science."
YANG2025101752,Enhancing computational thinking assessment: A multimodal cognitive diagnostic approach,"Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of CT is crucial for enhancing students’ CT. However, the current evaluation of CT is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real CT performance during the assessment process. This study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (H-MCDM) of students’ CT based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students’ CT and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. The research results indicate that: 1) students’ CT was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the CT components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different CT latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same CT latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different CT latent patterns could share similar characteristics. This study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students’ mastery of CT and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different CT latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students’ CT."
YUAN2025105174,Innovative ongoing support within a multifaceted computational thinking professional learning program improves teachers’ self-efficacy and classroom practices,"In-service elementary school teachers need training to teach computational thinking (CT). A common model for CT professional learning programs includes an initial workshop followed by ongoing support. However, little research has examined the efficacy of ongoing support, the most effective types, and its impact on classroom practices. The current study details a multifaceted CT professional learning program with innovative ongoing support to help elementary school teachers implement the Code.org curriculum. It also empirically investigated the impact of the support on teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT, the effectiveness of each component of the support, and to what extent it affected teachers' classroom practices. Our ongoing support included an additional workshop, grade-level professional learning community (PLC) sessions, instructional videos, and teacher leaders' support. Data included a pre-survey, four post-surveys, lesson observations, a focus group interview, tracking the number of video views, and surveys from PLC participants and teacher leaders. Results indicated that the ongoing support significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Regarding the effectiveness of the various components of the ongoing support, the additional workshop significantly increased teachers' self-efficacy in coding and teaching CT. Teachers valued each component of the support, and this support improved teachers’ classroom practices."
MISIRLI2023139,Computational thinking in early childhood education: The impact of programming a tangible robot on developing debugging knowledge,"The present study investigates the debugging process of 526 children in preschool (4–6 aged) when programming a tangible robot. When a child is involved in programming, it is needed to identify and correct errors, or in other words, debug a program. Debugging is a high-level thinking skill and is an essential component closely related to developing Computational Thinking in early childhood education. Though the debugging process is a cognitive function in programming investigated by many researchers in recent decades, most studies are conducted either in primary, secondary education, or higher education concerning beginners or experts in programming. Very few reviews, and some focus on preschool education. Our study set out the following objectives: 1) How do children identify the existence of error and locate it? 2) What types of errors emerge when coding? 3) What type of error is complex for novice programmers? 4) What strategies are developed by novice programmers to debug effectively? and 5) What types of knowledge do novice programmers construct by debugging the tangible robot Bee-Bot? The study follows an iterative model of a design-based research approach. It uses multiple case studies to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The programming intervention was implemented by 30 educators in their classrooms and was based on a scenario-based teaching design. The debugging process was analysed using Klahr & Craven's framework (1988): 1) test and evaluate program, 2) identify bug, 3) represent program, 4) locate bug and 5) correct bug. The main finding is the construction and development of syntactic and semantic knowledge."
LOUKA2024e30482,Enhancing computational thinking in early childhood education through ScratchJr integration,"A plethora of programming platforms purports to teach preschool-aged children computational thinking (CT) and coding skills. However, the empirical evidence to support their effectiveness is still in its early stages. A three-week didactic intervention using ScratchJr was conducted to investigate its effectiveness in fostering CT and rudimentary coding skills in a cohort of preschool children (N = 34, aged 4–6 years). While the initial performance mean of the control group (M = 7.07, SD = 2.58) exhibits a statistically significant elevation t (22.64 = 2.23, p = 0.036) vis-à-vis the experimental group (M = 5.35, SD = 1.58), t (22.64) = 2.23, p = 0.0 the terminal performance means of both groups converge closely. However, meticulous data analysis unveils a statistically notable enhancement among preschool participants exposed to the educational intervention involving ScratchJr. Notably, both instructional modalities appear commensurate in nurturing elementary computational tenets, namely modularity and control structures. The experimental cohort outperforms the control group with statistical significance in comprehending potent ideational constructs encompassing representation, algorithms, and hardware/software interplay. Conversely, the control group performs better in grasping the debugging concept than their experimental counterparts. The outcomes lend substantive credence to the efficacy of the distinct programming milieu offered by ScratchJr, underscoring its effectiveness in cultivating CT and coding proficiencies within the preschool demographic."
WANG2024101528,Can robot-supported learning enhance computational thinking?—A meta-analysis,"Computational thinking (CT) is crucial for students. Robot-supported learning has emerged as a popular approach for CT cultivation. To understand the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation, the current study conducted a meta-analysis to analyze studies from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases (2012–2022) which screened using keywords ``computational thinking'' and ``robot''. After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309). This meta-analysis indicates that educators could apply robot-supported learning to cultivate students' CT and concludes with related implications."
ZHANG2023101314,Exploring the underlying cognitive process of computational thinking in primary education,"Computational thinking (CT) has gained increasing recognition as a 21st-century competency. Although initiatives have been taken to define the term for educational practices, limited empirical evidence is available to clarify its underlying components, especially at the primary education level. This study aimed to identify the associations between CT and specific cognitive skills in the primary school context. Based on the literature, three cognitive domains were studied (i.e., mathematical, visuospatial, and reasoning skills) and standard test batteries were applied to a sample of 633 primary students (aged 7–12 years). Linear regression analyses were performed with CT performance as the dependent variable to investigate its associations with the measured cognitive skills, and demographic features (i.e., age, gender) and coding learning experience (i.e., years of coding experience, extra-curricular coding experience) were included as control variables. The results indicated that the students’ CT performance was significantly predicted by their attainments in numeracy, visual perception, spatial visualisation, and inductive reasoning, and the results remained significant after controlling for demographics and coding experience. The study adds to the literature by enriching the understanding of CT as a psychological construct and has practical implications for educational stakeholders regarding the importance of interdisciplinary teaching and the integration of specific cognitive skills into CT learning activities."
BARRICELLI2023111516,EUDability: A new construct at the intersection of End-User Development and Computational Thinking,"The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side."
YU2024101517,How to learn and teach a foreign language through computational thinking: Suggestions based on a systematic review,"There has been an increasing interest in the integration of technology into language education. Meanwhile, computational thinking (CT) skills are fostered which influence communicative language teaching and learning. Despite CT's established importance in science education, its significance in language teaching remains scarce. This study contributes to knowledge synthesis and methodological development by reviewing 16 journal articles, analyzing CT applications in language learning across educational contexts, intervention tools, CT skills, language acquisition, and assessment methods. The results indicate that (a) more CT-involved activities are needed for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, (b) educational robots and Scratch stand out as the most trending intervention tools, (c) CT skills such as decomposition, abstraction, generalization and so on have a positive effect on students’ foreign language acquisition, especially in grammar and writing, (d) assessment of CT development can be surveyed through a validated and reliable instrument such as computer programming self-efficacy scale or an online platform: Dr. Scratch; Conversely, there is a diversity of evaluation tools in foreign language learning. This study is the first to review experimental research on integrating computational thinking into foreign language learning and offers significant implications for future research."
MARINMARIN2024e29177,Computational thinking and programming with Arduino in education: A systematic review for secondary education,"The development of programming skills and computational thinking in the formal educational context is one of the most recent horizons set by many educational systems worldwide. Although the first computational thinking initiatives are being applied from the earliest school ages, this research focuses on the secondary education level. Specifically, the objective is the following: to analyse the implementation of Arduino, as well as the benefits and opportunities it brings to secondary school students. For this purpose, documentary research has been undertaken applying a systematic review according to the PRISMA 2020 framework following the PiCoS strategy. Atlas.ti 9 was used to analyse the information. Out of 316 papers identified, 37 were included in the research. In relation to the results, Arduino is primarily used in technology and physics subjects, although it is also used to develop interdisciplinary STEAM projects. As a rule, it is used to learn programming languages, but likewise as a resource to develop science experiments. LED lights, servomotors and breadboards are among the most commonly used resources together with the Arduino board. and Scratch was the most widely used software. The initiatives implemented have yielded both positive and negative results, for example, one drawback is that some projects are very difficult, and some achievements such as: increased motivation towards the contents addressed or also the development of some soft skills, such as problem solving."
OYELERE2023100016,Formative evaluation of immersive virtual reality expedition mini-games to facilitate computational thinking,"Recently, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown great potential in advancing education with many pedagogical benefits for building the 21st-century teaching and learning experience. This study conducted a formative evaluation of an immersive VR expedition application with the aim of understanding users' learning processes and how the application facilitates higher education students' computational thinking skills. Six participants were randomly selected to conduct this evaluation. A mixed research approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed. The study quantitatively analyzed users' scores from gameplay to understand how the intervention supported computational thinking skills. Participants were also interviewed to collect data after playing the mini-games to investigate users' experiences. The study showcases players' computational thinking competency, assessed automatically during gameplay. Further, this study used inductive content analysis to demonstrate users' reactions to prototyped VR mini-games. The qualitative findings suggest that users found the VR mini-games interactive and immersive, which provided an opportunity to foster learners' computational thinking skills. The quantitative analysis revealed that student's computational thinking competency can be enhanced through consistent playing of the mini-games. Moreover, the expedition aspect of the VR game stimulated learners' curiosity, which sustained their learning progress. Furthermore, users gained new knowledge and found the mini-games educative. Nevertheless, several aspects of the VR mini-games need improvements, according to users' perceptions. This study contributes to the knowledge in terms of the affordances of VR in education research and provides relevant insights that can shape future studies, for example, the recent hype of metaverse in education."
SAAD2022101802,A review of Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT) in teaching and learning,"Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Computational Thinking (CT), a teaching strategy and a problem-solving method, respectively, have been widely used in teaching and learning because of their educational advantages for students and teachers. However, studies of their integration into the teaching and learning process have been scarce, resulting in a lack of guidance for educators to implement such an approach that apply constructivism learning theory. This study aims to systematically review and identify appropriate frameworks, models, techniques and tools that could guide the successful implementation of PBL-CT. This study examined relevant articles published from 2017 to 2021 to highlight the gaps in the PBL-CT execution and map their backgrounds into a coherent taxonomy that could help guide the directions of future studies. As revealed, none of such articles explicitly explain any suitable PBL-CT frameworks or models. The study identified several common elements for the PBL-CT framework formulation, indicating scaffolding and inquiry are the most commonly applied techniques, with visual tools dominating the PBL-CT implementation. Most articles involved computing, followed by STEM, with a few originating from non-STEM fields. Several important implications could help educators develop an effective PBL-CT course design and provide some guidelines for future research. An effective PBL-CT integration enhances teaching and learning besides improving students' computational thinking skills. Thinking skills are critical 21st-century skills needed for students' success."
MONTEYNE2025105181,Teachers’ computational thinking content knowledge: Development of a measurement instrument,"Computational thinking has become an integral component of curricula worldwide, necessitating teachers to develop this competence in their students. To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way."
ZHAO2022104445,Effect of different mind mapping approaches on primary school students’ computational thinking skills during visual programming learning,"Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping support that facilitates students’ CT."
HARPER2023381,Centering teacher and parent voice to realize culturally relevant computational thinking in early childhood,"The specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how PreK parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. We drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. We discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering children's self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing."
FALLOON2024105045,Advancing young students’ computational thinking: An investigation of structured curriculum in early years primary schooling,"In recent years, the development of computational thinking (CT) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education."
BAKALA2021100337,"Preschool children, robots, and computational thinking: A systematic review","We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies aimed at exploring robot-mediated activities to promote the development of computational thinking in preschoolers. In this study, we investigated the robots used, proposed activities, and evaluation processes. We also analyzed research contexts and the stated motivations to conduct the studies. Our review identified characteristics of the robots, such as input and output interfaces, cost, and availability. We also categorized activities considering context, modality of work, type of activities, duration, adults’ role, scaffolding, unplugged activities, explicit debugging, communication and sharing instances, and teaching knowledge from other domains. We analyzed the computational thinking evaluation process looking at types of assessments, asset concepts, and research design. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing research, identifies existing gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies."
REINHOLD2025100260,Introducing computational thinking to second and third graders. Programming whole paths outperforms step-by-step navigation in maze tasks,"Computational Thinking (CT) has been considered one of the 21st century skills that already primary school students should develop. In this study we compared different methods for guiding a real object through a training maze task to teach N = 70 second and third graders basic computational thinking concepts, i.e., basic directions and sequences. Students in the experimental condition used LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Essential-Set and Scratch-based icon blocks software to navigate a maze, while the control group used regular LEGO®-Sets and verbal commands. Results supported our hypotheses: students in the experimental condition outperformed those in the control condition, produced longer sequences and more sequence commands to direct their object through the maze, and a positive relationship was observed between sequence length and posttest performance. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that the effect of the intervention on posttest achievement was influenced by the use of longer sequences. Our study underpins that Scratch-based block programming combined with robot-like real-world devices is a promising way to utilize CT in (early) primary education—and deepens our knowledge about how students engage in relevant learning activities."
YENI2024100696,Computational thinking integrated in school subjects – A cross-case analysis of students’ experiences,"The integration of computational thinking (CT) into K-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students’ understanding across various subject areas. By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society."
MADARIAGA2023104664,"Offline and online user experience of gamified robotics for introducing computational thinking: Comparing engagement, game mechanics and coding motivation","As we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. Such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology."
AGBO2024101458,How can unplugged approach facilitate novice students’ understanding of computational thinking? An exploratory study from a Nigerian university,"Computational thinking (CT) has been relevant in teaching STEM courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged CT activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. However, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of CT concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. Indeed, CT unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained CT competency. In addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction."
PIATTI2022100166,The CT-cube: A framework for the design and the assessment of computational thinking activities,"Computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in K-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. Despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils’ age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. Furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. In this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called CT-cube. The CT-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. We use the CT-cube to design an unplugged task, called Cross Array Task (CAT), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of K-12 pupils and we show how the CT-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in Switzerland."
YOUJUN2022101143,Computational thinking: A mediation tool and higher-order thinking for linking EFL grammar knowledge with competency,"The current single teaching and assessing modes of English as a foreign language (EFL) grammar in China have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. To solve the problem, computational thinking (CT), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. As needed, the experimental group was taught using the CT teaching model following CT principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. Quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. The results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. However, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. CT serves as an important social mediation tool in EFL teaching. This study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing CT into learners’ thinking patterns."
CLARKEMIDURA202368,Designing formative assessments of early childhood computational thinking,"With growing interest in supporting the development of computational thinking (CT) in early childhood, there is also need for new assessments that serve multiple purposes and uses. In particular, there is a need to understand the design of formative assessments that can be used during classroom instruction to provide feedback to teachers and children in real-time. In this paper, we report on an empirical study and advance a new unit of observational analysis for formative assessment that we call an indicator of a knowledge refinement opportunity or as a shorthand, KRO indicators. We put forth a new framework for conceptualizing the design of formative assessments that builds on the Evidence Centered Design framework but centers identification and analysis of indicators of knowledge refinement opportunities. We illustrate a number of key indicators through empirical examples drawn from video recordings of Kindergarten classroom lessons."
ZURNACI2024101576,Educational robotics or unplugged coding activities in kindergartens?: Comparison of the effects on pre-school children's computational thinking and executive function skills,"This study compares the effects of coding education with educational robot and unplugged coding activities on pre-school students' computational thinking and executive function skills. This study used a pre-test and post-test comparison group quasi-experimental design. The study was conducted in a public kindergarten with 48 pre-school students (24 educational robot- BeeBot® group and 24-unplugged coding group) aged 5-6. The TechCheck-K test was used to measure computational thinking skills, and Executive Functions Battery-Computerized Touch was used to measure executive function skills. The process started with pre-test applications and ended with post-tests after four weeks (16 different sessions) of the implementation in both groups. The study found a statistically significant difference between the computational thinking pre-test and post-test scores of pre-school students in both groups in favor of the post-test. It was determined that there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the educational robot group between the post-test scores of computational thinking skills. In addition, when the findings regarding executive functions were evaluated, there was a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of total executive function in favor of the post-test in both groups. However, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between the post-test scores of both groups in terms of total executive function skills scores. In addition, when the post-test scores of pre-school students in two groups were evaluated, it was determined that there was no significant difference in computational thinking and executive function skills according to gender. Consequently, it was determined that coding education with an educational robot was more effective for gaining computational thinking skills than unplugged coding activities for pre-school students. However, it was observed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the development of executive function skills in pre-school education."
NOCERINO2023112626,Computational LEED: computational thinking strategies and Visual Programming Languages to support environmental design and LEED credits achievement,"Since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, Green Building Certification Systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology."
PROCTOR202388,Computational thinking,"Computational thinking, defined by Wing (2011) as the “thought processes involved in formulating problems … so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent,” has become the central construct of K12 computing education around the world. This article provides a history of computational thinking, a summary of computational thinking's role in educational policy and practice, role as a research construct, and concludes by considering the future of computational thinking. The debate over how to define and teach computational thinking can be understood as a proxy for the broader questions about education."
LEWISPRESSER202342,Data collection and analysis for preschoolers: An engaging context for integrating mathematics and computational thinking with digital tools,"Collecting and organizing data to understand and answer real-world questions is an increasingly important skill in our current world. Fostering data collection and analysis (DCA) skills in young children leverages key mathematics skills as well as the data representation, visualization, and interpretation skills of computational thinking (CT), culminating in a problem-solving approach with data. As such, the intervention, comprising investigations and a digital app, supported preschool teachers and children to answer data-focused questions by engaging in each step of the DCA process in order to foster CT and math skills. Teachers appreciated that the app offers a new way for children to visualize data and noted that the app provided learning opportunities for children that would not otherwise be possible or easy to implement. Results also suggest that the app provides a systematic process for data collection, entry, and interpretation. Children in classrooms that completed the intervention had significantly higher scores at post-intervention compared to children in classrooms that did not complete the intervention, controlling for pre-intervention scores, B(SE) = 0.13(0.05), t (6) = 2.48, p = .048."
SAIG2024100703,Expanding digital literacies beyond the digital: Infusing computational thinking into unplugged pedagogical tools - Two case studies from mathematics education,"Computational Thinking (CT), the conceptual foundations required for solving complex problems effectively and efficiently, is an imperative skill for today's learners, across disciplines and across ages. As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development."
AVITAL2023101417,"Associations between Computational Thinking and Figural, Verbal Creativity","Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been pointed out as two important skills that would promote students in the digital age as contributing members of society. Therefore, these two constructs have been extensively researched in recent years, but the associations between them are yet to be fully understood. This study takes another step towards bridging this gap by examining the association between CT and three types of creativity, i.e., Figural Creative Thinking, Verbal Creative Thinking, and Computational Creativity. Data was collected from 119 ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from Israel. Students took two commonly used creativity tests (Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking, and the Alternative Uses Test). They also used Kodetu—an online learning environment for CT—and we used the system log files to measure their CT acquirement and their computational creativity. Findings suggest some nuanced associations between the four sets of variables. Specifically, we point out the limited associations between verbal and figural creativities, some of which are negative; also, we found that the associations between creative thinking and CT, as well as between creative thinking and computational creativity, differ by gender."
YANG2025102041,The impact of a block-based visual programming curriculum: Untangling coding skills and computational thinking,"Background

Results caution against incorporating disconnected abstract computational thinking practices in education. The features of the curriculum were discussed."
RAHIMI2025100607,Scaling up computational thinking skills in computer-assisted language learning (CTsCALL) and its fitness with language learners’ intentions to use virtual exchange: A bi-symmetric approach,"Many studies have demonstrated that Virtual Exchange (VE) for teaching languages can have a positive effect on learners' intercultural awareness or achievements. However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well."
ZENG2023100520,Computational thinking in early childhood education: Reviewing the literature and redeveloping the three-dimensional framework,"Computational thinking (CT) is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners all over the world to empower children in the digital era. However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct). This systematic review and its associated CT curriculum framework provide important theoretical contributions and practical implications for early childhood CT education."
MONTUORI2024104961,The cognitive effects of computational thinking: A systematic review and meta-analytic study,"In this paper, we review and meta-analyze the findings of experimental studies published between 2006 and 2022 that examined the effects of coding and programming interventions on children's core and higher order executive functions (response inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and problem solving). The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20)."
ROSLI2024110463,"Unlocking insights: A comprehensive dataset analysis on the acceptance of computational thinking skills among undergraduate university students through the lens of extended technology acceptance model, HTMT, covariance-based SEM, and SmartPLS","In light of the increasing importance digital economy, the significance of computational thinking has grown exponentially, becoming imperative in both workplace and academic settings such as universities. This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings. This dataset stands among the pioneering efforts to assess the novel covariance-based structural equation model algorithm within SmartPLS 4, presenting a valuable resource for future research employing the same mechanism."
LAVIGNE2023102,Computational thinking with families: Studying an at-home media intervention to promote joint media engagement between preschoolers and their parents,"This paper describes a study designed to investigate the promise of resources that support the development of computational thinking (CT) in preschool children. This study was the culmination of a collaborative research process between researchers and media developers of a home-based intervention that included media and hands-on activities created to support the development of young children's CT. The mixed-methods study included 108 families, each with a 4- or 5-year-old child. Families, who participated in the study at home for six weeks, were randomly assigned to an intervention group that viewed media and engaged with hands-on activities with a CT focus or a control group that viewed and engaged with non-STEM literacy content. Data collection consisted of parent surveys, parent interviews, and CT learning and pre-coding tasks to assess children's CT abilities. Results indicate that the learning intervention demonstrates promise in supporting parental understanding of CT. Experience with the intervention over the six weeks also appeared to cultivate some CT strategy use in children as evidenced by parental reports and performance on learning and pre-coding sequencing tasks."
MARTINS2023100566,Systematic mapping of computational thinking in preschool children,"This study characterizes the literature on teaching computational thinking (CT) to preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years. Previous research and published systematic studies have provided important contributions about CT teaching to elementary and high school children. However, to date, there is no systematic overview of CT education for preschoolers. For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms."
ALONSOGARCIA2024e33249,Enhancing computational thinking in early childhood education with educational robotics: A meta-analysis,"This paper deals within a context where technology plays a pivotal role in education. In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap."
GUNTOSIK2024101552,The effect of computer science unplugged on abstraction as a sub-component of computational thinking,"Since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. While there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. In addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. As a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. The study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. Quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. Quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. Qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. Suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. Finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction."
ROBLEDOCASTRO2023105738,Cognitive stimulation of executive functions through computational thinking,"The healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. Over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on children’s cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. This pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the “Programming for Children” program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (N = 30). The results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. However, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. Although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples."
YANG2025105282,A three-phase professional development approach to improving robotics pedagogical knowledge and computational thinking attitude of early childhood teachers,"Computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. With the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. However, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. To empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ‘CT4ECE’ professional development program, which includes three phases: Learn, Practice, and Reflect & Improve. Results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the CT4ECE program significantly enhanced teachers' robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. Post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in CT4ECE helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers' professional learning. This study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the CT4ECE program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future."
CIFTCI2023101337,Improving early childhood pre-service teachers’ computational thinking skills through the unplugged computational thinking integrated STEM approach,"The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (CT) integrated STEM (UCT-STEM) approach and STEM approach on early childhood pre-service teachers’ CT skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). The study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. Quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the UCT-STEM approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the STEM approach were administered to the control group. Post-test scores for CT skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. It was concluded that the UCT-STEM approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers’ CT skills than the STEM approach. The current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed STEM and UCT-STEM contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers’ CT skills. The STEM and UCT-STEM content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. At the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs."
WANG2024104619,Teaching design students machine learning to enhance motivation for learning computational thinking skills,"The integration of computational thinking (CT) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices."
TSARAVA2022104425,A cognitive definition of computational thinking in primary education,"There is increasing effort to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) curricula across all education levels. Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages."
MARTINNUNEZ2023100128,Does intrinsic motivation mediate perceived artificial intelligence (AI) learning and computational thinking of students during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning."
YANG2024104962,Enhancing elementary school students' computational thinking and programming learning with graphic organizers,"Computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. It is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. However, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. The graphic organizers (GOs) may serve as a bridge between students’ existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. This can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. Consequently, this study employed GOs to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to GO-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences."
KONG2023107749,Monitoring cognitive development through the assessment of computational thinking practices: A longitudinal intervention on primary school students,"Computational thinking (CT) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. Few studies investigated CT practices from a development perspective. A two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in Hong Kong to promote CT education (T1baseline: N = 13,056; T2: N = 16,367; and T3: N = 15,269). Senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 8–12 years old were targeted. Among them, 34% were girls at T1baseline. Their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a CT practices test. Data were analyzed using item response analysis. Learning trajectories of CT practices were modeled to understand how students’ cognitive development differed between schools. Insights of findings were discussed in bringing CT practices to life."
LI2024101537,Engagement predicts computational thinking skills in unplugged activity: Analysis of gender differences,"Engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. However, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. This discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individual's preferences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. In this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north Chinese primary school was performed. By partial least squares–structural equation modeling, students’ models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. Results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. Furthermore, girls’ computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys’ computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls."
SOHR202392,How a child entangles empathy and computational thinking in reasoning about fairness,"In this work, we argue for expanding the scope of K-12 computational thinking (CT) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. Epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see “seeds of CT” in children's reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into CT. Taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, Ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. Our analysis finds that Ollie's reasoning was rich with seeds of CT (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the CT. This work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for CT integration."
LAI2021104287,Investigating the impact of a flipped programming course using the DT-CDIO approach,"Currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in programming courses. It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23). The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors."
PEREZMARIN2020105849,Can computational thinking be improved by using a methodology based on metaphors and scratch to teach computer programming to children?,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key skill in the 21st century. However, it is not clear which is the most effective way to acquire and improve CT. Big research efforts are made to determine which pedagogical means should be used. One research trend is based on the idea that teaching programming since Primary Education suffices to improve CT. In our previous work, we proposed and validated a methodology based on metaphors and used of Scratch (MECOPROG) to teach basic programming concepts to children. It is our hypothesis H that by applying MECOPROG, students will develop their CT. To check H, we carried out an experiment with 132 Primary Education Students (9–12 years in age). At the beginning of the experiment, all students were asked to fill in a programming concepts test and two tests to measure their CT. During the sessions, all students were taught according to MECOPROG. Finally, they took the three tests again. A significant increase in the results on all the tests has been measured, supporting the use of metaphors and Scratch to teach computer programming concepts to Primary Education students to develop their CT."
BACELO2023101284,Characterising algorithmic thinking: A university study of unplugged activities✰,"Algorithmic thinking is a type of thinking that occurs in the context of computational thinking. Given its importance in the current educational context, it seems pertinent to deepen into its conceptual and operational understanding for teaching. The exploration of research shows us that there are almost no studies at university level where algorithmic thinking is connected to mathematical thinking, and more importantly, to characterise it and be able to analyse and evaluate it better. The aim of this research is to characterise algorithmic thinking in a university context of the Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics by unplugged tasks, offering a model of analysis through categories that establish connections between mathematical and algorithmic working spaces in three dimensions, semiotic, instrumental and discursive. The results confirm the interaction between these dimensions and their predictive value for better programming performance. The study also adds novel considerations related to the role and interaction of mathematical and computational thinking categories involved in algorithmic thinking."
BORREGO2024101948,DPGraphJ: A Java package for the implementation of dynamic programming algorithms,"This paper introduces the DPGraphJ package, a collection of reusable Java functions to solve optimisation problems using a dynamic programming algorithm. The latter is based on a recursive schema that follows a top-down approach and uses the memoisation technique. This algorithm is a reusable software component that is generic and efficient. Moreover, it has been developed by paying special attention to good practices in the design of software. For using DPGraphJ, the problem to be solved needs to be modelled as an AND/OR graph. In the DPGraphJ package, we provide 5 academic case studies with detailed comments. We strongly believe that our proposal can be helpful for several kinds of users, such as students, researchers, and practitioners."
KONG2022104562,Validating a computational thinking concepts test for primary education using item response theory: An analysis of students’ responses,"Although instruments for assessing students' computational thinking (CT) concepts in primary education have been developed, they have rarely been validated in terms of item response theory (IRT). We consider IRT to be a rigorous validation tool and apply it to a CT concepts test for primary education involving 13,670 students. A two-parameter logistic model was chosen over other IRT models, as it indicated an acceptable model fit and item fit. The discrimination parameters indicated that the instrument could effectively distinguish between students with various ability levels. Nominal response modelling in IRT was used to retrieve information from the students' responses, and those with a lower ability level were found to only consider one of the conditions provided, had no understanding of the repetition structure, and might have difficulties in associating a sprite with its corresponding codes. Based on ability estimates, we also found that the students’ ability in terms of CT concepts increased with grades and that boys generally performed slightly better than girls. These results suggest that the instrument can be used to examine the learning achievements of students in terms of CT concepts."
KONG2024105016,"The impact of school support for professional development on teachers' adoption of student-centered pedagogy, students’ cognitive learning and abilities: A three-level analysis","Student-centered pedagogy (SCP) is highly considered for its potential to facilitate cognitive learning in Computational Thinking (CT) education. However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding its influence on students' cognitive development from a multilevel perspective. This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three-level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students’ cognitive learning (i.e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education. Recommendations for future research are discussed."
ROWE2021106707,Assessing implicit computational thinking in Zoombinis puzzle gameplay,"There has been growing interest in assessing computational thinking (CT) across diverse learners beyond the traditional forms of tests and assignments. Learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students' implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. This paper reports on the measurement of implicit CT practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the CT learning game Zoombinis. The process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students' implicit CT practices is discussed. Findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit STEM learning."
KONG2023104707,"Scaling up a teacher development programme for sustainable computational thinking education: TPACK surveys, concept tests and primary school visits","Computational thinking (CT) education in K-12 requires extensive teacher development. This research investigates the effectiveness of a scalable and sustainable teacher development programme in promoting CT in primary education. This report presents two studies. Study 1 reports on the effectiveness of two 12-h courses using Scratch and App Inventor programming environments for CT development of teachers respectively, which involved 245 teachers from 47 primary schools. With teaching practices embedded, the programme, which used the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), significantly enhanced teachers' content-related knowledge dimensions. The results indicate that the programme helped teachers develop advanced CT concepts such as data structures and procedures. Study 2, using thematic analysis, reports on CT strategies implemented in 47 schools through 94 school visits. The most mentioned strategies were the formation of teaching teams, lesson co-planning, and the integration of CT with subject teaching. The most mentioned challenges were teacher readiness, lesson time, and diversity – learners' abilities, interests, and approaches. Four types of support, including teacher development support, continuous and communal support, teaching materials support, and financial support were identified. The results suggest that a course-based programme with mixed programming environments and embedded teaching experience effectively develops teachers’ capabilities. However, continuous support for teachers in implementing the initiative after completing the programme is important, especially in addressing learner diversity and integrating CT with subject teaching."
SHAHIN2022111107,How secondary school girls perceive Computational Thinking practices through collaborative programming with the micro:bit,"Computational Thinking (CT) has been investigated from different perspectives. This research aims to investigate how secondary school girls perceive CT practices – the problem-solving practices that students apply while they are engaged in programming – when using the micro:bit device in a collaborative setting. This study also explores the collaborative programming process of secondary school girls with the micro:bit device. We conducted mixed-methods research with 203 secondary school girls (in the state of Victoria, Australia) and 31 mentors attending a girls-only CT program (OzGirlsCT program). The girls were grouped into 52 teams and collaboratively developed computational solutions around realistic, important problems to them and their communities. We distributed two surveys (with 193 responses each) to the girls. Further, we surveyed the mentors (with 31 responses) who monitored the girls, and collected their observation reports on their teams Our study indicates that the girls found “debugging” the most difficult type of CT practice to apply, while collaborative practices of CT were the easiest. We found that prior coding experience significantly reduced the difficulty level of only one CT practice - “debugging”. Our study also identified six challenges the girls faced and six best practices they adopted when working on their computational solutions."
SONG2021106746,"Applying computational analysis of novice learners' computer programming patterns to reveal self-regulated learning, computational thinking, and learning performance","Educational research on predicting learners’ computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. Recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed."
SHAMIR2022100415,Teaching machine learning in elementary school,"The emergence and ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence in the form of Machine Learning (ML) systems have revolutionized daily life. However, scant if any attention has been paid to ML in computing education, which continues to teach rule-based programming. A new, promising research field in education consists of acquainting children with ML to foster this much-needed shift from traditional rule-driven thinking to ML-based data-driven thinking. This article presents the development of computational thinking competencies in 12-year-old students who participated in a learning-by-design or a learning-by-teaching ML course. The results, based on a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the students’ achievements, indicate that they demonstrated computational thinking competencies at various levels. The learning by design group evidenced greater development in computational skills, whereas the learning by teaching group improved in terms of computational perspective. These findings are discussed with respect to promoting children’s problem-solving competencies within a constructionist approach to ML."
JOHNSON2025101757,"Shifting pedagogically: Incorporating the social, cultural, and emotional dimensions of student learning to develop STEM-identities in computer science","Through qualitative inquiry of a 9th-grade computer science (CS) classroom, this paper examines how teachers' pedagogical approaches can help prioritize the social and emotional dimensions of student learning to foster STEM identity and development. Findings from an ethnographic study of the delivery of the Exploring Computer Science curriculum in a high school setting of majority of students of color, and low-income youth identify five high-leverage instructional strategies. These strategies include 1) teacher mindsets towards specific subject areas like computer science; 2) creating conditions for affirming students culturally; 3) intentionally prioritizing student autonomy for social and emotional development; 4) co-constructing knowledge to increase student engagement; and 5) helping students create their own STEM identity by exposing them to STEM professionals of similar racial and cultural characteristics as students. Collectively, these practices offer critical windows into how educators can act as intermediaries in helping students see themselves in the CS field and STEM/CS career pathways. Findings from this study can inform strategies for teacher education and policy efforts seeking to close learning gaps for historically marginalized groups and to improve racial and gender diversity in opportunities for growing STEM fields."
HOU2020100720,Computational thinking training with technology for non-information undergraduates,"Technology not only allows us to (co-)create, collect, store, and use knowledge and information, but it also enables us to connect with people and resources all over the world, to collaborate in the creation of knowledge, and to distribute and benefit from knowledge products. In this study, two visual and interactive pedagogies in information technology are used to train non-technical students and evaluate the performance and feedback of students in a programming course in the Department of Beauty Science. Computational thinking was integrated into the design and application of the programming subject. At the end of the semester, data were collected from 40 sophomore students in the Department of Beauty Science who answered the technology acceptance model (TAM) questionnaire and Learning Satisfactory Questionnaire after the training. An analysis was conducted using basic statistical and correlation methods, and the items demonstrated good reliability for Scratch and Tableau. The mean of 14 items in the TAM questionnaire was above 3.5 for Scratch, and that of four items was lower than 3.5 for Tableau. The mean of all the items was above 4.40 for the Learning Satisfactory Questionnaire. In the correlation analysis, the variables of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were positively related to the attitude and behavior in Scratch and Tableau. The use of visual and interactive programming pedagogies enhanced the interest of novice and non-technical students in learning technology. The learners were satisfied with the interactive pedagogies on computational and spatial intelligence."
LEI2020105439,Computational thinking and academic achievement: A meta-analysis among students,"This meta-analysis examines whether greater computational thinking is linked to greater academic achievement among students from 1st graders in primary school to 4th year seniors at university. Results from 34 studies showed that computational thinking and academic achievement were positively correlated (0.288). Moderator analysis showed that this correlation was (a) stronger among students in Eastern cultures than Western cultures; (b) strongest among primary school students, less strong among secondary school students, and weakest among undergraduates; (c) stronger among females than males; and (d) strongest when assessing assignment scores; less strong with GPA, course grade, or tests; and weakest with quizzes. Neither subject content (e.g., math, science) nor sampling strategy (e.g., randomized, convenience) moderated the link between computational thinking and academic achievement. In sum, the positive link between computational thinking and academic achievement is moderated by culture, grade, achievement indicators, and gender."
PLOOG2024100653,The intentions of the designers of digital educational tools in early childhood education,"The popularity of programmable robots in early childhood education is growing. Such robots are discussed in the literature from the points of view of teachers, parents and children. We add the role of robot designers to this list. Focusing on designers and specifically their intentions is beneficial in two settings: in teacher training and whenever using the robots in playing activities in ECE. We present a qualitative study on robot designer intentions, conducted by group interviews with designers of two common but significantly different programmable robots, the Kubo robot and the Rugged robot. Using Activity Theory as the underlying framework for the thematic analysis of the interviews, our data reveal a large overlap of the intentions of both groups. They express the common goal of preparing children for the future although through slightly different competencies: enhancing computational thinking and 21st century skills, respectively. Both groups highlight the relevance of subjects outside computer science, specifically beyond coding. Our data also show a design process difference the Rugged robot was developed with a teacher-oriented approach whereas the Kubo robot with an object-oriented approach."
BENVENUTI2023107903,Artificial intelligence and human behavioral development: A perspective on new skills and competences acquisition for the educational context,"Despite the significant emphasis placed on incorporating 21st century skills into the educational framework, particularly at the primary level, recent scholarly works indicate considerable variation in the implementation of these skills across different countries and regions, suggesting a demand for further research specifically focusing on primary education. The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context. The analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts."
HOOSHYAR2021106575,An adaptive educational computer game: Effects on students' knowledge and learning attitude in computational thinking,"Several studies have reported that adaptivity and personalization in educational computer games facilitate reaching their full educational potential. However, there is little effort to develop adaptive educational computer games for promoting students' computational thinking (CT). In this study, an adaptive computer game is introduced, called AutoThinking, that not only promotes both CT skills and conceptual knowledge, but also provides adaptivity in both game-play and learning processes. To evaluate the possible effects of the game, an experimental study was carried out with 79 students in an elementary school in Estonia. AutoThinking and a conventional technology-enhanced learning approach were used for teaching CT to the experimental and control group, respectively. Our results reveal that AutoThinking improved students’ CT skills and conceptual knowledge better than the conventional approach. It was also found that students with a low and high level of prior knowledge made higher improvement in knowledge gain using the adaptive game compared to the traditional approach, especially those students with lower prior knowledge. Finally, our findings show that the adaptive game could also improve students' learning attitude toward CT better than the conventional approach, especially those students with higher prior learning attitudes."
TIKVA2021100849,A systematic mapping study on teaching and learning Computational Thinking through programming in higher education,"Computational Thinking (CT) through programming in higher education is considered an important skill for students to become problem solvers and thrive in the new digital workplace. Despite the wide interest, a systematic map of CT through programming in higher education is still missing. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we aim to provide a systematic map of the relevant research by identifying the areas and sub-areas of CT through programming teaching and learning in higher education. Second, we aim to investigate these areas based on two dimensions: their evolution over the years and the branches to which CT is applied. For this purpose, we apply a systematic mapping methodology. Main results include the identification of the CT areas of Knowledge Base, Assessment, Learning Strategies, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building. Of these, Knowledge Base, Assessment and Tools have significantly evolved throughout the years, while Capacity Building has only recently emerged. In addition, the introduction of CT to undergraduate students and preservice teachers differs mainly in the tools used and the CT elements that are assessed. The study contributes to the field by providing a structured type of research conducted and identifying gaps and opportunities for future research."
KONSTANTINIDOU2022104424,"Teaching with technology: A large-scale, international, and multilevel study of the roles of teacher and school characteristics","Providing high-quality instruction with technology has become more important than ever before. However, the instructional practices and the degree to which key skills, such as digital literacy and computational thinking, are emphasized in classrooms vary considerably between teachers, schools, and countries. The present study was aimed at explaining this variation in the frequency of teaching practices with technology and teachers' emphasis on developing students' computer and information literacy and computational thinking by key aspects of teacher motivation and expertise, school conditions and priorities, and countries' economy and innovation. Utilizing large-scale, representative data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2018 (15,015 teachers in 1195 schools in eight countries), we performed multilevel structural equation modeling and regression trees and found that teacher motivation and collaboration were positively and consistently linked to teaching practices across countries. Besides, principals' expectations concerning the teaching with technology explained variation in Finnish and German schools. In three countries, teachers' professional development was related to their teaching practices. Finally, countries’ economic development and innovation explained variation in the teacher-level effects. Our study sheds new light on the possible factors related to teaching with technology and advances the field by taking a multilevel and international perspective on these factors."
TIKVA2021104083,Mapping computational thinking through programming in K-12 education: A conceptual model based on a systematic literature Review,"Computational Thinking (CT) through programming attracts increased attention as it is considered an ideal medium for the development of 21st century skills. This intense attention leads to K-12 initiatives around the world and a rapid increase in relevant research studies. However, studies show challenges in CT research and educational practice. In addition, the domain has not been mapped to facilitate comprehensive understanding of the domain challenges and development of CT curricula. The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model based on a systematic literature review that maps the CT through programming in K-12 education domain. The proposed Computational Thinking through Programming in K-12 education (CTPK-12) conceptual model emerges from the synthesis of 101 studies and the identification of CT Areas. The proposed model consists of six CT Areas (namely Knowledge Base, Learning Strategies, Assessment, Tools, Factors and Capacity Building) and their relationships. The model could aid domain understanding and serve as a basis for future research studies. In addition, it could support the integration of CT into K-12 educational practices, providing evidence to educational stakeholders and researchers as well as bringing closer research, practice and policy."
ZHONG2025105230,Evaluating AI literacy of secondary students: Framework and scale development,"K-12 AI education not only equips students with AI literacy but also encourages underrepresented groups to pursue further studies or careers in this field. Secondary students were particularly well-suited for comprehensive AI education due to their cognitive characteristics and developmental readiness. While most studies have focused on developing pedagogy, curriculum, and tools for secondary AI education, they have prioritized measuring students' learning outcomes over literacy development. Referring to the empirical research on secondary AI education as well as Piaget's Epistemology and Bloom's Taxonomy, this study figured out a KAT framework that constitutes AI literacy: (1) AI Knowledge (AI fundamentals, elements of AI technology, application of AI technology), (2) AI Affectivity (AI and human, AI and society), and (3) AI Thinking (engineering design thinking, computational thinking). Based on this, a 57-item AI literacy scale (AILS) was developed, and 56 items were retained after expert judgement. Then, a large sample of Chinese secondary students was surveyed, resulting in 1392 valid samples, which were randomly divided into two sub-samples: 720 samples were used for item reduction through Rasch Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis; 672 samples were used for model validation and comparison through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results indicated the AILS with three-factor structure of 48 items has a good reliability and validity. Moreover, gender differences in AI literacy among secondary students were examined. Results indicated that boys had significantly higher AI Knowledge than girls, whereas girls had significantly higher AI Affectivity than boys. The implications, limitations and future research were also discussed."
LU2023100154,Developing a weather prediction project-based machine learning course in facilitating AI learning among high school students,"The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has changed lifestyles, work patterns, and educational approaches. However, courses that can guide students through the practical applications of AI technology are still scarce in K-12 education. This study aimed to develop a project-based machine learning (ML) course for the implementation of AI technology. The core idea of this course, which focused on the supervised learning of AI ML technology, was designed based on the project of weather prediction. Furthermore, data collection and status display were realized using various hardware devices such as Arduino and sensors, whereas ML algorithms were implemented in Python programming language. A total of 68 eleventh-grade senior high school students from a public school in Southern Taiwan participated in this study. The main variables included understanding AI concepts, computational thinking (CT), and learning attitude. Data were analyzed using quantitative statistics, including descriptive statistics, t-test, and analysis of covariance, supplemented with qualitative data. Based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the proposed course on the implementation of ML helps students understand the basic concepts of AI; (2) students demonstrate a significant improvement in CT skills after attending this course; (3) although the students’ attitude toward learning AI shows no significant change after attending this course, their overall view for it is positive; (4) contrary to their learning attitude, the CT skills among the students with different capabilities of learning AI are significantly dissimilar. Overall, the machine-learning implementation course developed in this study can serve as a reference for promoting AI education in the future. However, considering learners’ prior knowledge in programming, setting up appropriate learning scaffolding for them, and providing them with more examples of the applications of AI in real-life scenarios is still necessary when conducting the course for improving the students’ attitude toward AI."

ANGELI2020106185,Computational thinking education: Issues and challenges,"Computational Thinking is a term applied to describe the increasing attention on students' knowledge development about designing computational solutions to problems, algorithmic thinking, and coding. It focuses on skills children develop from practicing programming and algorithms, and enables the development of qualities such as abstract thinking, problem solving, pattern recognition, and logical reasoning. Contemporary educational and infrastructural developments, like “CS for All” (https://www.csforall.org/), ISTE's Standards for Students in Computational Thinking (https://www.iste.org/explore/Solutions/Computational-thinking-for-all?articleid=152), Computer Science Teachers Association's Concepts of Computational Thinking (http://advocate.csteachers.org/2014/09/15/computational-thinking-and-beyond/), and the appearance of tools such as robotics, 3D printing, microprocessors, and intuitive programming languages posit Computational Thinking as a very promising area to support these learning competences. In this special issue of Computers in Human Behavior, the Editors report four studies conducted by interdisciplinary teams. The introduction to the special issue also draws attention to the great potential and need for further research in the area of Computational Thinking Education to engage students in meaningful learning so as to develop useful thinking skills and digital competences. Finally, the Editorspropose directions for future research and practice in Computational Thinking Education."
DING202319,Mathematics in STEM education,"In this article, we discuss how mathematics can play a role in STEM activities in K–12 classrooms. From the perspective of content, we argue that mathematics serves as a language tool to help represent/model STEM activities and explain/interpret identified solutions. From the perspective of process, we argue that mathematics serves as a thinking tool because mathematical reasoning is at the core of problem solving. In addition, computational thinking is a critical skill for solving problems in complex systems. We conclude our study with three suggestions that help make mathematics more explicit in K–12 STEM classrooms."
BUCCIARELLI2022100443,The causes of difficulty in children’s creation of informal programs,"We present a theory of the causes of difficulty in children’s creation of informal programs. Ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mAbducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mAbducer’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. Children’s errors are predictable in both their location and nature. Our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking."
KONG2021106836,Item response analysis of computational thinking practices: Test characteristics and students’ learning abilities in visual programming contexts,"Computational thinking (CT) practices have gained increasing importance in primary school education. However, there are few tools to measure primary school students' CT practices that are based on rigorous psychometric approaches. This study developed an operational definition for CT practices by exploring the key dimensions of their composition and, more importantly, developed and validated a generic test tool that can effectively assess students’ CT practices. Items to measure CT practices were developed using the evidence-centered design (ECD) approach. These items prompted students to exhibit behaviors that demonstrated their skills in the four dimensions of CT practice, namely testing and debugging, algorithmic thinking, reusing and remixing, and abstracting and modularizing. A test consisting of these items was administered to 13,956 Grade 4–6 primary school students from 56 public schools in Hong Kong. The data were analyzed based on the item response theory (IRT) approach, together with other psychometric tests. A bi-factor three-parameter logistic model was ultimately adopted for test validation, as it fitted the data better than the corresponding two-parameter and one-parameter logistic models. The results validated the four-dimensional structure of the CT practices test. The reliability, test item characteristics, and CT practice abilities of students are also discussed."
SU2022100049,Artificial intelligence in early childhood education: A scoping review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly being used in the field of early childhood education (ECE) to enhance learning and development among young children. Previous proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that AI can effectively improve teaching and learning in ECE; however, there is a scarcity of knowledge about how these studies are conducted and how AI is used across these studies. We conducted this scoping review to evaluate, synthesize and display the latest literature on AI in ECE. This review analyzed 17 eligible studies conducted in different countries from 1995 to 2021. Although few studies on this critical issue have been found, the existing references provide up-to-date insights into different aspects (knowledge, tools, activities, and impacts) of AI for children. Most studies have shown that AI has significantly improved children's concepts regarding AI, machine learning, computer science, and robotics and other skills such as creativity, emotion control, collaborative inquiry, literacy skills, and computational thinking. Future directions are also discussed for researching AI in ECE."
SUN2023101340,Does text-based programming improve K-12 students’ CT skills? Evidence from a meta-analysis and synthesis of qualitative data in educational contexts,"Promoting computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in K-12 education, and the shift from visual to text-based programming is an inevitable trend in programming education. Although research on K-12 text-based programming to promote CT skills has been increasing, a literature review that systematically organizes and analyzes it has not yet emerged. Moreover, there are no uniform conclusions on how to design text-based programming activities to effectively promote students’ acquisition of CT skills. The purpose of this study was mainly to determine the effectiveness of using text-based programming to enhance K-12 students’ CT skills, to explore the effects of various text-based programming instructional design factors on CT skill acquisition, and to discuss the key issues and future development of text programming in the K-12 stage. In this study using the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative method of systematic literature review, 46 studies of text-based programming on K-12 students’ CT skills were retrieved, of which 19 empirical studies including 37 effects size met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and were therefore used as a meta-analysis. The results showed that text-based programming improved the CT skills of K-12 students overall (Hedges’ g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90], p < 0.01). No publication bias was detected. In addition, the results of the moderator analysis revealed that: 1) text programming had the greatest impact on computational thinking development in middle school students (g = 0.833, p = <0.05); 2) the duration of text programming instruction had the most significant positive impact on students' CT at 16–20 weeks (g = 1.038, p <0.05); 3) the moderating effect of different assessment tools on CT skills in text programming instruction The difference was statistically significant, and the test assessment method had a highly significant positive moderating effect on CT skills of students in grades K-12 (g = 1.005, p < 0.05); 4) The moderating effect of different student sample sizes on students' computational thinking development was significantly different, and the implementation of text-based programming instruction had the most significant effect on students' CT improvement among students with sample sizes of 41 ∼ 60 (g = 0.921, p < 0.05); 5) There were no significant differences in the effects of different text-based programming languages and learning environments on students' computational thinking.However, there are still barriers to developing instructional practices for text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students, such as the highly abstract and complex syntax of text-based programming. This study found that the most critical issues that need to be addressed in current text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students are the lack of student interest in text-based programming and the misconceptions that arise when students move from visual programming to text-based programming. To address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing student motivation and interest. To address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing students' motivation and interest."
YUEYIM2024100319,A critical review of teaching and learning artificial intelligence (AI) literacy: Developing an intelligence-based AI literacy framework for primary school education,"Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy education mainly targets secondary and university students, often overlooking the unique needs of younger students. This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students. The research contributes by conceptualizing AI literacy and guiding policymakers and curriculum designers to implement holistic AI literacy education for young students."
BILBAO2021e06135,"Study to find out the perception that first year students in engineering have about the Computational Thinking skills, and to identify possible factors related to the ability of Abstraction","Since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. At the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. Likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of Computational Thinking was resurrected by J. Wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. Today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called Computational Thinking, related to others that already exist. In this paper, we have studied the skills of Computational Thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. Results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. Although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study."
LI2023101369,A study on the relationship between student' learning engagements and higher-order thinking skills in programming learning,"Learning engagements in programming learning activities are critical to developing students' higher-order thinking skills. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between K-12 students' learning engagement levels (i.e., cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, and behavioral engagement) and higher-order thinking skills (i.e., computational thinking, problem solving, creative thinking, and critical thinking) in programming learning, and the moderating effects of behavioral engagement and emotional engagement on this relationship. A total of 714 K-12 students in China's Zhejiang Province participated in this study and completed an online questionnaire, which included the learning engagement scale and the high-order thinking tendency scale. Cross-sectional survey data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression as a way to examine the relationship between the variables. The results showed that cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, and behavioral engagement were all key factors in developing those students' higher-order thinking for programming learning activities in K-12 students during associated activities. Furthermore, when the students' emotional engagements were elevated, the positive relationships between cognitive engagement, computational thinking, and creative thinking were closer. Inversely, when students' behavioral engagement was high, the positive relationship between cognitive engagement and critical thinking, and the positive relationship between emotional engagement and problem-solving and critical thinking became looser. These results can help deepen educators' understanding of the relationship between learning engagement and higher-order thinking skills to facilitate their search for effective strategies to improve programming instruction. Additionally, it can provide a more precise research direction for the broader development of programming education."
PENG20231143,Design of Data Persistence for Network Resources Recommendation System Based on Hibernate Architecture,"The Python language is more focused on problem solving, which is in line with the era of computational thinking, and the teaching of Python language course requires students to systematically master the basic concepts, programming ideas and programming techniques of Python, and have the idea of object-oriented software design technology. We have developed a recommended system of online resources for ""Python Programming"" course to solve the problem of students' access to resources and deepen the teaching reform of the Python Programming course. Data persistence is an important task in system development, and Hibernate is the most popular O/R Mapping framework. The data persistence design based on Hibernate solves the key technical problems in the development of the network resource recommendation system for the ""Python Programming"" course, and improves the efficiency and maintainability of the software system development."

FAGERLUND2022100511,Fourth grade students’ computational thinking in pair programming with Scratch: A holistic case analysis,"This article explores a new but expanding research topic: primary school students’ computational thinking (CT) in the context of programming in pairs. The data comprises four fourth-grade student dyads using Scratch, a block-based programming tool, for two open-ended creative programming sessions. We sought insight into how the dyads put four intertwined CT dimensions – planning; iteration; collaboration, social interactions, and remixing; and debugging – into practice. To examine these dimensions, the data was analysed systematically in three overlapping layers: what happens on the computer screen (design events), who uses the computer (computer control), and what kind of talk is occurring (talk). The temporal viewpoint in the multi-layered analysis revealed and enriched holistic understanding of key computational and social factors, such as initial project planning methods, programming tendencies, and pair programming roles that essentially shaped the dyads’ design processes. Next to opportunities for more focal research in CT education, the results provide especially evidence-based pedagogical knowledge for supporting students’ open-ended programming in the classroom. In particular, concrete suggestions for supporting open-ended project planning, balancing between self-directed design and instructional support during programming, and promoting shared design processes in pair programming are provided based on the findings."
MANNILA2023100132,Student and teacher co-agency when combining CT with arts and design in a cross-curricular project,"The technological development has raised awareness for the importance of digital competence and computational thinking (CT) to understand the digital world and has resulted in revised curricula in many countries. In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1–9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4–6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers’ knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students’ skill and ambition level."
LAURENT2022101667,Impact of programming on primary mathematics learning,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether a programming activity might serve as a learning vehicle for mathematics acquisition in grades four and five. For this purpose, the effects of a programming activity, an essential component of computational thinking, were evaluated on learning outcomes of three mathematical notions: Euclidean division (N = 1,880), additive decomposition (N = 1,763) and fractions (N = 644). Classes were randomly assigned to the programming (with Scratch) and control conditions. Multilevel analyses indicate negative effects (effect size range −0.16 to −0.21) of the programming condition for the three mathematical notions. A potential explanation of these results is the difficulties in the transfer of learning from programming to mathematics."
MARQUEZ2024107434,Inclusion of individuals with autism spectrum disorder in Software Engineering,"Context:
Software Engineering is dedicated to the systematic and efficient development of software, which necessitates the active participation of all team members and a recognition of their unique skills and abilities, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The inclusion of individuals with ASD presents new perspectives, yet there is a lack of systematic evidence regarding the primary obstacles and potential benefits associated with their inclusion.
Objective:
This paper aims to identify, characterize, and describe barriers, facilitators, and methodological proposals described by the community to include individuals with ASD in the discipline of Software Engineering.
Methods:
We conducted a comprehensive systematic multivocal mapping study to evaluate the existing evidence on the inclusion of individuals with ASD in Software Engineering.
Results:
We obtained 34 primary studies from which we identified the main facilitators of motivation to learn new skills, attention to detail, and the ability to report and visualize patterns. In contrast, the main barriers detected were communication, a lack of neurodivergent computational thinking, and sensory integration. Additionally, we identified and classified four categories of proposals that allowed the inclusion of individuals with ASD: (i) using virtual reality, (ii) creating more inclusive workspaces, (iii) encouraging neurodivergent computational thinking, and (iv) improving social skills.
Conclusions:
This study identifies the principal elements that ought to be taken into consideration when allocating tasks and roles to individuals with ASD in software development."
MACRIDES2022100396,Programming in early childhood education: A systematic review,"The current study aims to provide a systematic review of the literature about the teaching of programming in early-childhood education, and specifically for the age group of 3–8 years old. The review presents empirical investigations with young learners and reports on relevant frameworks and curriculum programs, effects of teaching approaches and educational tools on learning, and learning outcomes and pedagogical benefits of teaching programming. Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach. The authors conclude that future research should devote time and effort in the development of educational curricula in which the teaching of programming is fully integrated, as well as teacher training programs so that teachers become competent to teach programming in early childhood education."
HARANGUS2020615,Computational Thinking in Secondary and Higher Education,"One of the most important challenges of education is the formation of proper computational thinking (CT). In line with K-12 Computer Science Framework (k12cs.org) the term of CT refers to the “thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer”. CT is a problem solving process essential to the development of computer applications, but it is also used in supporting problem solving across many other disciplines. It has gained some grounds in secondary education in the last few years and there are ongoing efforts to introduce it to elementary education as well. Taking into consideration that algorithms play a central role in computational thinking, the aim of our research was to assess the skills of secondary school students and university students in this area, CT, that they faced an apparently computer science – free task but with obvious algorithmic background. According to the aims of our research there were two target populations: secondary school students and university students. In order to measure the level of computational thinking we elaborated a worksheet (test with problems to be solved). The tasks contained algorithms that can be applied on computer, and they did not need any IT knowledge, only structured and logical thinking. The results provide a reliable guide regarding those cognitive skills, among secondary school-children and university students, which need improvement, so transfer of knowledge could work in practical, life-like situations."
HUANG2024100651,Deepening children’s STEM learning through making and creative writing,"Current trends demonstrate that researchers and K-12 educators are moving towards integrating computational thinking (CT) concepts outside of the computer science (CS) classroom (Lee et al., 2020). However, one of the present challenges includes a lack of engaging learning content and instruction for translating computational concepts that non-CS instructors can bring into their classrooms. Our research team developed the Grove-Blockly platform, a website that employs block-based programming and physical computing elements with simulations to support CT learning and IoT practices. We designed a 5-day workshop with the National Writing Project for students to engage in STEAM learning through making and creative writing. By examining students’ learning through the processes and outcomes of making, coding, and creative writing, we aim to better understand how learning occurs at the intersections of making, writing, and computing. The findings show students’ positive learning outcomes of CT and physical computing from the workshop. Mainly, students gained a deeper understanding of IoT elements (e.g., sensors, actuators) through the process of making and creative writing. This work provides empirical evidence on how students learn CT and computational practices through making and creative writing. Finally, we discuss how the engagement of STEAM practices supports and empowers students’ learning of CT and physical computing through the creation of e-crafts by students."
HSU2021100012,Behavioral-pattern exploration and development of an instructional tool for young children to learn AI,"This study aimed at developing an instructional tool for the artificial intelligence education of young students, and used learning analytics to identify the sequential learning behavioral patterns of students during the process of learning with the instructional tool. The instructional experiment took 9 weeks. The first stage of the course was 5 weeks spent on individual learning of MIT App Inventor and Personal Image Classifier. The second stage was 4 weeks spent on cooperative learning to make a robot car and play a computational thinking board game. In the second stage, the students worked in pairs to make the robot car. Finally, they played the computational thinking board game with the personal image classification application they developed in the first stage and the robot car they made in the second stage. The innovative studies found meaningful behavioral patterns when the young students learned the application of artificial intelligence with the instructional tool developed and proposed in the study."
CARDENASSAINZ2022100381,Integration and acceptance of Natural User Interfaces for interactive learning environments,"This study focuses on the design of interactive learning environments (ILE) enhanced with Natural User Interfaces (NUI) for educational applications. It presents a 3D virtual environment, namely THINKMOTION which enables students to practice computational thinking skills. THINKMOTION combines a visual programming interface for coding and creating 3D virtual scenes with physics simulations, with a gesture recognition system for interaction over virtual objects. The ILE integrates a NUI called Leap Motion Controller, which recognizes the users’ hand movements and gestures A questionnaire was designed in order to evaluate the perceptions toward experimental learning with students of public and private secondary schools. It applies Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and enhanced with new constructs such as perceived enjoyment and interface style. Results from our study highlight that: (1) NUI technologies positively impacted enjoyment and perceived ease of use among ILE users; (2) The ease of use provided by NUIs improved the enjoyment of students; (3) The perceived enjoyment considerably increased the intention to use; (4) For public school students, NUI technology has a significant impact on their first impressions and overall interest, followed by a positive attitude toward using ILE; (5) Private school students who are more accustomed to and familiar with using natural interfaces presented a positive attitude and enjoyment when using the ILE."
LIN2020101011,Enhancing Computational Thinking Capability of Preschool Children by Game-based Smart Toys,"Computational thinking has become an important issue in the field of education. Because preschool and kindergarten learners are capable of exercising their cognitive abilities to resolve basic computational logic, this demographic has raised significant interest in studying their learning intentions and behaviors. However, prior research fails to examine the effects of teaching computational logic to kindergarten children. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influences of teaching approaches in guiding preschool children to learn computational logic and programming concepts to enhance their problem-solving skills as well as computational thinking abilities. A novel teaching framework is designed to develop the learner’s cognitive abilities, which adopts the smart toy game-based learning approach along with a tangible user interface (TUI) to enhance children’s learning performance and interests. The proposed teaching approach integrates the game-based learning concepts into the TUI system, where the learning processes allow the learners to effectively practice the conceptual knowledge and efficiently advance their problem-solving skills. The results suggest using the developed game-based TUI system can increase preschool children’s learning behaviors as well as enhance their learning interests and computational thinking abilities."
MATTHEWS2025100725,Social and curious: Lessons in designing digital manipulatives for young children,"Introducing Digital Literacy (DL), including Computational Thinking (CT), to young children develops foundational skills in computer science, problem-solving, and critical thinking. However, current digital toys for demonstrating computational thinking strategies are not always designed for early-year environments or specifically for young (preschool) children. Digital manipulatives incorporating embedded computation can offer developmentally appropriate tools to introduce foundational programming strategies and dynamic system knowledge before children become developmentally ready for more formalised programming activities. This paper presents an empirical study in a preschool environment with children (aged 3–5 years) using novel digital manipulatives, Embeddables, in child-led free and guided play activities in a preschool (Fig. 1). From our analysis of the types of activities the children engaged in, we identified underexplored design features of digital manipulatives that can build early exposure to CT skills through ludic and epistemic play. These are designed-in behaviour, distributed interactivity, conditional and proximal relations between artefacts, and abstracted multisensorial reactions."
MONGEROFFARELLO2025100937,"Supporting teachers, engaging students: A collaborative model for K-12 computing education","Although the importance of Computational Thinking (CT) for children is increasingly recognized, its adoption in computing education curricula in primary schools is limited by several open challenges, including teachers’ training and curricula development. Seeking to systematize a process that enables primary school teachers to teach CT through computing education in primary schools, we present the design, evaluation, and analysis of an introductory coding course for 4th-grade classes in a large Italian city, utilizing the Scratch platform. The course followed a project-based learning approach, empowering groups of children in designing and implementing simple video games, and explored the adoption of a collaborative strategy through which computing experts, class teachers, and high-school tutors proactively supported the project work. We evaluated and refined the course educational strategies by conducting an observational study and co-designing activities with the involved teachers. Then, we derived an educational model that may allow K-12 teachers and experts to collaborate in designing and implementing computing education courses that are engaging, inclusive, and supportive."
KUCUK2020100167,Students’ attitudes towards robotics and STEM: Differences based on gender and robotics experience,"In this study, Turkish secondary school students’ attitudes towards robotics and STEM were examined in terms of gender and robotics experience. Sample consisted of 240 secondary school students (98 females and 142 males; grades 5–7). Two scales were used to collect data: STEM Attitude Scale and Robotics Attitude Scale. The data were analyzed using a One-way MANOVA and through correlational methods. Results show that the students’ attitudes towards robotics and STEM were positive. Gender had no effect on STEM attitudes. However, in terms of robotics attitudes, female students had significantly less desire and less confidence to learn robotics than male students. There was no gender effect on computational thinking and teamwork. Implications were discussed in terms of theoretical insights, practices for educational robotics in STEM, and directions for further research."
WOO2022101193,"Problem solved, but how? An exploratory study into students’ problem solving processes in creative coding tasks","Problem solving capabilities have often been reported by teachers as a key benefit from creative coding activities in school-age children. However, few studies to date have defined problem solving, and investigated how it is operationalised in interdisciplinary creative coding tasks. This study aims to build knowledge about students’ use of computational thinking and computer science concepts for problem solving when coding animated narratives. The research investigated students’ coding processes using data gathered from audio and device display recordings and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest limitations to the use of creative coding tasks if the expectation is to develop computational thinking and systematic problem solving strategies, or learn basic computer science concepts. They revealed that novice students rarely solved coding problems using optimal technically-based strategies despite being given explicit instruction on their use, opting instead to bypass problems by adjusting intended outcomes, or by using low level code translation strategies. Results demonstrate that engaging computational thinking or even demonstrating understanding of basic computer science concepts was not a requirement to produce a viable creative coding outcome. This study contributes new understanding of students’ coding practices when engaged in creative coding tasks in regular, non-specialist classrooms. Its findings challenge the commonly-held assumption that coding is a natural ‘vehicle’ to develop computational thinking and systematic approaches to problem solving. It also questions the learning that results from the non-technical, inefficient and often ineffective problem solving practices students employ during ‘creative coding’ tasks, that are frequently used by non-specialist teachers in response to curriculum requirements."
THEODOROPOULOS2021100335,Augmented Reality and programming education: A systematic review,"In recent years, Augmented Reality (AR) usage in the learning process has been growing. AR tools and environments lead to a variety of positive outcomes and impacts for educational purposes. Similarly, AR is changing the learning process in the Computer Science (CS) Education domain. There are numerous studies that adopt the immersive AR technology in order to improve Computational Thinking (CT) or programming skills, in several contexts. However, there are not sufficient studies that analyze the meaningful characteristics or the advantages and disadvantages of AR in the field. In order to better understand the impact of AR in programming education we performed a systematic literature review. This review analyzes 31 studies in the field. It explores the evolution of this developing technology, the challenges and issues that AR offers and discusses how this work can benefit student learning and further research."
WOLFENGAGEN2024101183,Building a cognitive system based on process interaction,"According to modern notions, computing is not separable from cognitive modeling and activity. This paper continues the tradition of the uniform approach and proposes a small number of general mechanisms that cope with the main known effects of computing as a science — the interaction of objects-as-processes, the interaction of processes with the environment, generalized interaction. As shown, the applicative prestructure (objects-as-processes, application) generates an applicative structure (processes, application, values), which ensures the generation of the result — the value of interactions, enabling the process of evaluation. The theory of combinators is used as the main (meta)mathematical means. A diagram mechanism has been developed that implements the emerging applicative computational system of object interaction and reflects the arity of accompanying the induced information processes. The processes are bidirectional in nature, both with a decrease in arity – reduction, and with an increase in arity – expansion."
OUYANG2023104721,"Effect of augmented reality-based virtual educational robotics on programming students’ enjoyment of learning, computational thinking skills, and academic achievement","The use of educational robotics for programming education has been shown to be effective in fostering students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. However, physical educational robots are expensive, which may limit their wide use in the classroom. This study used augmented reality technology to develop a virtual educational robotic system (AR Bot for short), which offers 3D visual learning feedback to strengthen spatial ability, as well as delayed feedback and auto-scoring feedback to promote students’ deeper CT processes. To examine the impact of AR Bot on programming learning, this study used a quasi-experimental design to compare an experimental group of 41 first-year university students who used AR Bot and a control group of 34 first-year university students who used Scratch. We assessed the impact of the two CT tools on students’ internal learning processes (enjoyment of learning), CT skills (problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills), and academic achievement. The results showed that students who used AR Bot had higher enjoyment of learning, algorithm design skills, and algorithm efficiency skills but not higher problem decomposition skills and academic achievement than students who used Scratch. Enjoyment of learning led to higher problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills but not academic achievement. Problem decomposition and algorithm design skills, but not algorithm efficiency skills, led to academic achievement. The theoretical and practical implications of the proposed tool and other CT tools in programming education are discussed."
KIM2025103508,Playful design for AI Literacy: Creating inclusive learning and assessment opportunities,"Artificial Intelligence is reshaping human interactions with technology and society at large, yet public awareness of its prevalence remains limited, fostering misconceptions and raising concerns about its potential to perpetuate societal inequities. In this paper, we argue that AI literacy is a foundational skill akin to reading and numeracy, and advocate for its broad integration into educational curricula beyond traditional STEM domains. Despite various initiatives promoting AI literacy in K-12 education, existing efforts predominantly focus on computational skills, excluding many underrepresented students. The paper proposes inclusive learning opportunities that decouple AI literacy from computational thinking by centering on playful activities. By investigating the implementation of a playful AI curriculum, we provide qualitative evidence that demonstrates how playful design features can offer authentic and engaging learning opportunities, even for students who might face barriers."
ARFE2020103807,The effects of coding on children's planning and inhibition skills,"Computational thinking (CT) and the coding element of it are progressively entering in the primary school curriculum worldwide. Yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on children's cognitive development. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5 classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8 h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop), were used to assess children's skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. Such findings add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding, deepening our understanding of the positive implications of introducing Computational Thinking early in the school curriculum."
SILVIS2022100491,Children caring for robots: Expanding computational thinking frameworks to include a technological ethic of care,"Computational thinking (CT) is receiving growing attention in educational contexts, where robot coding toys are becoming a widely available means of teaching and learning early computing. As the field of child–computer interaction continues to define what it means for young children to think computationally, much is unknown about the affective dimensions of children’s interactions with computers, for example how children care for materials like coding robots and how they establish social responsibility in computational environments. This paper examines these questions in the context of an early childhood coding curriculum designed to support CT in Kindergarten. Children’s talk and interactions with robots provide insight into how they were learning to care for and maintain robots when they malfunctioned. Drawing together feminist perspectives on computing, constructionism, and care, we develop a notion of a technological ethic of care and locate this in children’s early coding experiences. Through critical discourse analysis, we present two cases where groups of children interacted with each other, their teachers, and a robot called Cubetto, establishing forms of responsibility for technology. We argue that an ethic of care must be part of computational discourses in an era of climate change, where caring for technologies and keeping them in working order is key to sustainable socio-ecological relations."
BAYAGA2024100491,Enhancing M Enhancing mathematics problem-solving skills in AI-driven environment: Integrated SEM-neural network approach,"This study explores the nexus of gamification, artificial intelligence (AI), and mathematics cognition. Sample size of 71 responded in an intervention using game-based learning (GBL) approach. The purpose of designing the GBL was to enhance computational thinking and mathematical skills. The research employed multigroup partial least squares structural equation modelling (MGA-PLS-SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) through multilayer perceptron (MLP) as data analysis technique. The findings showed significant positive influence on class engagement, attitudes toward mathematics, as well as student performance. The analysis also revealed gender-related variations, which affirmed the model's consistency across diverse groups. The study validated the hypothesis and consequently advocated for the transformative potential of gamification, in preparation of 21st-century learners for AI-driven digital landscape. The implications are to ensure the integration of gamified elements into educational strategies, benefiting educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers resonating strongly for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers."
SUN2022104457,Programming attitudes predict computational thinking: Analysis of differences in gender and programming experience,"Programming attitude has received increasing attention in programming and computational thinking (CT) education. However, at present, analysis remains scant on the correlation between students' programming attitudes and their CT skills, and less attention is paid to the influencing effects of gender and programming experience. This study first validated a newly developed programming attitudes scale (χ2/df = 2.308, RMSEA = 0.073, CFI = 0.925, TLI = 0.912) among 1180 seventh-grade students (12–13 years old). It then analyzed the relationship between students' programming attitudes and CT skills considering gender differences. Students' programming attitudes significantly predicted their CT skills. Girls have higher CT skills than boys, but their more negative programming attitudes may affect their continued skill development. Third, the relationship among programming experience, programming attitudes, and CT skills was discussed among the sample (N = 175) with programming experience, revealing that programming attitudes played an intermediary role between programming experience and CT skills. Two specific factors of programming experience (first time learning programming and programming learning duration) had differing effects on students' programming attitudes and CT skills. For programming attitudes, the grade in which students got started with programming had no effect on their programming attitudes, but programming attitudes rose with increased programming learning time. For CT, students who learned programming starting in second grade possessed the highest CT level. In addition, there is an inverted U-shaped curve between students' programming learning duration and CT skills, peaked at the fourth year of programming learning career. Implications for promoting junior high school students’ CT skills and their positive attitudes toward programming are also discussed."
SIMONSMEIER2025102699,The effects of programming interventions in early childhood: A meta-analysis,"While recent meta-analyses confirm the positive effects of programming interventions in school and university students, it is still unclear whether teaching programming in early childhood settings is similarly effective. Our meta-analysis clarifies this issue by synthesizing the effects of programming interventions for 3- to 7-year-old children. Moreover, we propose and employ a taxonomy for instructional approaches commonly used in programming interventions to systematically analyze the relevance of instructional design. The results from 25 early childhood studies and 82 effect sizes showed a medium overall effect of d = +0.73, 95 % CI [0.51, 0.96]. Programming interventions effectively enhanced programming knowledge, computational thinking, mathematics knowledge, and cognitive skills. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of unplugged over screen-based activities and interventions, including robotics, over those using other program outputs. The results provide educators with valuable information about instructional methods. The taxonomy can guide researchers and educators in implementing instructional strategies when teaching programming.
Educational relevance statement
The current meta-analysis extends the current understanding of programming interventions by summarizing the existing body of literature on the effectiveness of programming interventions in young children. Since there exists a growing interest in teaching programming to young children, the results make a useful contribution to determine its effectiveness and to identify effective instructional characteristics. The found results indicate that programming interventions are indeed significantly effective in early childhood to enhance a variety of outcomes. Further, the analyses provide information that allow educators to implement age-appropriate programming interventions in educational settings (e.g., by using unplugged programming activities or including robotics)."
HWU2023433,Chapter 19 - Parallel programming and computational thinking,"This chapter introduces the concept of computational thinking. It first reviews the main goals of parallel programming. It then discusses the thinking process of algorithm selection and problem decomposition. For a given problem the programmer will typically have to select from a variety of algorithms. Some of these algorithms achieve different tradeoffs while maintaining the same numerical accuracy. Others involve sacrificing some level of accuracy to achieve much more scalable running times. For the selected algorithm, different choices of problem decomposition can result in different levels of interference between threads, parallelism exposed, load imbalance, and other performance considerations during parallel execution. Computational thinking skills allow an algorithm designer to work around the roadblocks and reach a good solution."
SUN2021100926,Improving 7th-graders’ computational thinking skills through unplugged programming activities: A study on the influence of multiple factors,"Programming is an important way to cultivate students’ computational thinking (CT) skills, which is the essential ability of students in the 21st century. As one of the mainstream forms of programming education activities, unplugged programming activities are mainly implemented in the early stage of basic education. However, considering the lack of programming experience among Chinese junior high schoolers and the uneven distribution of programming education resources, an 8-week quasi-experimental study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of unplugged activities in improving junior high schoolers’ CT skills, and to identify the influence of multiple factors. A total of 93 7th-graders volunteered to participate in the experiment: 62 students were divided into two experimental groups, which were intervened by unplugged activities to repeat the results’ reliability, and 31 students were used as the control group without any unplugged programming activities. The results of the intra-group and inter-group comparison show that unplugged programming is a more effective way to improve 7th-graders’ CT skills. Students’ mathematic performance and previous programming experience had a significant impact on their CT skills, but this impact is not reflected in the process of unplugged programming activities. It can be said that all students can develop their CT skills through unplugged programming activities, regardless of their learning background. In the current context, unplugged programming activities can be used as an effective way for junior high schoolers to improve and develop their CT skills. In addition, this paper also discusses the enlightenment to improve students’ CT skills."
CHAN2021e07922,Learning number patterns through computational thinking activities: A Rasch model analysis,"Despite the increasing presence of computational thinking (CT) in the mathematics context, the connection between CT and mathematics in a practical classroom context is an important area for further research. This study intends to investigate the impact of CT activities in the topic of number patterns on the learning performance of secondary students in Singapore. The Rasch model analysis was employed to assess differences of ability between students from the experimental group and control group. 106 Secondary One students (age 13 years old) from a secondary school in Singapore took part in this study. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent groups design was utilized where 70 students were assigned into the experimental group, and 36 students were assigned into the control group. The experimental group was given intervention with CT-infused activities both on- and off-computer, while the control group received no such intervention. Both groups were administered the pretest before the intervention and the posttest after the intervention. The data gathered were analyzed using the partial credit version of the Rasch model. Analysis of pretest and posttest results revealed that the performance of the experimental group was similar to the control group. The findings did not support the hypothesis that integrating CT in lessons can result in improved mathematics learning. However, the drastic improvement was observed in individual students from the experimental group, while there is no obvious or extreme improvement for the students from the control group. This study provides some new empirical evidence and practical contributions to the infusion of CT practices in the mathematics classroom."
RELKIN2021104222,Learning to code and the acquisition of computational thinking by young children,"This longitudinal study examined changes in Computational Thinking (CT) skills in first and second grade students exposed to a developmentally appropriate coding curriculum. The “Coding as Another Language” (CAL) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the KIBO robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated “unplugged” CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (Mchange = 0.94, p < .001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (Mchange = 0.27, p = .07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (p < .01). Improvements in CT measured by TechCheck over seven weeks of the CAL-KIBO curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. Secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that CAL exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. The CT domains that showed improvement in children who received CAL-KIBO included algorithms, modularity, and representation. Young children who learned to code improved in solving unplugged problems that were not explicitly taught in the coding curriculum. This provides evidence that a developmentally appropriate curriculum for teaching young children to code can accelerate their acquisition of CT skills."
KONG2020106230,Formation of computational identity through computational thinking perspectives development in programming learning: A mediation analysis among primary school students,"This study aimed at investigating whether Computational Thinking (CT) Perspectives can foster Computational Identity (CI) among primary school students in programming learning from the perspective of situated learning theory. This study conceptualized CT perspectives as a multidimensional construct that comprises (1) ability to connect, (2) ability to question, and (3) ability to express, and CI with four subcomponents including (1) programming affiliation, (2) programming engagement, (3) programming actualization, and (4) programming goal setting. Students who received at least 6-month programming training for computational thinking development were invited to participate in this study. Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) suggested that the CT perspectives instrument (n = 100) and CI instrument (n = 241) reached good fit and therefore were validated in the pilot study. In the main study, survey answers (N = 215) including CT perspectives and CI were collected. Results of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed positive relationships between CT perspectives and CI formation among primary school students. Mediation results further revealed that ability to question can foster CI formation through ability to express, while ability to connect can directly foster CI formation. Implications were discussed at the end of the study."
STUPURIENE2024104939,Teachers’ perceptions of the barriers and drivers for the integration of Informatics in primary education,"A growing trend of integrating and teaching Informatics and Computational Thinking (CT) skills at primary education levels poses different challenges for teachers. Research demonstrates that it is challenging to introduce Informatics in schools without well-prepared teachers. In this paper, we examine Lithuanian teachers' perceptions of the barriers and drivers to integrate the renewed Informatics curricula in primary education and the relation between them. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary school teachers, and a mixed-methods approach was employed to analyze them. The results show that explicit guidelines for renewed curricula and motivation to learn Informatics are both identified as the main barriers and drivers for integrating Informatics. The study further highlights the critical role of resources, appropriate tools, and guidelines in facilitating the successful implementation of Informatics. The study provides knowledge that could, for instance, benefit teacher training programmes and help better understand how teachers can be better supported to meet current and future challenges."
SALEEM2024100124,Understanding 21st century skills needed in response to industry 4.0: Exploring scholarly insights using bibliometric analysis,"International policy agendas are increasingly focusing on the 21st century skills needed by future workers in response to Industry 4.0. In this study, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of 2662 articles published by 6579 authors in the last two decades to understand the structure of the scholarly knowledge in this field. We first identify influential articles, documents, journals and trends in this literature. We use co-citation analysis to identify foundational themes in the development of 21st century skills literature, then using bibliometric coupling, we identify communities in the current research front. We then use co-word analysis to identify future directions in the field. Overall, we find that research on 21st century skills has grown exponentially in the past two decades, however, few researchers focus primarily on this topic. The existing research is primarily dominated by psychologists, education researchers and technology researchers. We also find that specific disciplines such as industrial engineering and nursing are prominent contributors in the field, and that critical thinking and computational thinking are key areas of focus."
PAPAVLASOPOULOU2020105939,Coding activities for children: Coupling eye-tracking with qualitative data to investigate gender differences,"Computational thinking and coding are becoming an integral part of K-12 education, with female students being underrepresented in such subjects. The proliferation of technological tools and programming environments offers the opportunity for creative coding activities for children and increases the need for appropriate instructional practices. In this study, we design and evaluate a coding workshop for children. Our goal is to examine differences between boys and girls using eye-tracking as an objective measure and triangulating the findings with qualitative data coming from children's interviews. The results show no statistically significant difference between female and male gaze and learning gain during the coding activity; interestingly, the qualitative data show differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding, and in perceptions about those coding activities. Our results highlight that further studies need to utilize objective measures and unveil necessary differences in the design and implementation of coding activities. Furthermore, our results provide objective evidence that female students do not lack in competences compared to boys, but simply that they have a different approach during coding activities and different perspectives about coding, an approach that needs to be cultivated and nurtured."
VOURLETSIS2022100069,Exploring the effect of remixing stories and games on the development of students' computational thinking,"Computational thinking (CT) is broadly recognised as a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that enable their computer-mediated representation across a variety of fields. Nowadays, it is argued that CT needs to be expanded towards new pathways that establish a less individualistic and more social CT. One of these pathways consists of modifying and sharing versions of projects that other members of the community have created, but few researchers have investigated how it might be applied to primary school pupils. In this study we aimed to address the effect of a CT course on (a) primary school students’ reusing and remixing proficiency level and (b) the CT concepts they modify while they engage in reusing and remixing Scratch projects. Forty pairs of participants worked with Scratch, a block-based visual programming language, remixing projects related to stories and games. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, a rubric, and an online analytical tool, Dr. Scratch. The results of the analysis suggest that our instructional intervention, and especially game remixing activities, can improve students’ reusing and remixing proficiency; however, students modify different CT concepts when they remix stories and games."
ZHA2022104623,A mixed-method cluster analysis of physical computing and robotics integration in middle-grade math lesson plans,"This study analyzed 281 lesson plans collected from the producers’ websites of 12 educational physical computing and robotics (ePCR) devices. We extracted and coded five variables from each lesson. They were ePCR functionality, coding skills, computational thinking skills, math knowledge, and activity design. First, a two-step cluster analysis was administered to find how three ePCR-related knowledge: ePCR functionality, coding skills, and computational thinking skills, were integrated to teach students ePCR technology in middle-grade math lessons. Results showed three types of lesson plans, including lessons to use basic ePCR functionality to teach students lower-level CT skills, lessons to teach students basic to intermediate coding skills, and lessons to use the technology at the advanced level. Next, we applied the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and conducted a second two-step cluster analysis to identify how the technology (ePCR technology), content (math knowledge), and pedagogy (activity design) were integrated into those lesson plans. Results suggested ten clusters of lesson plans with distinct features. We summarized those ten lesson clusters into five categories: 1) ePCR technology lessons, 2) transdisciplinary problem-based learning lessons, 3) technology-assisted lessons, 4) lessons without real-world connections, and 5) lessons integrating middle-grade math learning into ePCR projects. Implications for educators and researchers were discussed at the end of the article."
SJODAHL2023100573,Abstracting and decomposing in a visual programming environment,"A growing body of research concerned with computational thinking (CT) has emerged the last couple of years, but there is still a lack of consensus about the definition of CT. There are also gaps in the understanding of how young children manifest CT. With this paper, we contribute to the field by taking an action perspective with the CT of K-3 students. The analysis focus on iterative acts of abstraction and decomposition as a core process that elicits development of CT. We call these iterative acts the Abstraction/Decomposition spiral (AD spiral). By illustrating the AD spiral through the actions of two first grade students, the analysis shows how visual representation of an emerging solution, and the development of a plan are two important elements when young students solve problems in a coding context, developing their CT."
LECORCHICK2020655,Problem Solving Archetype - Computer Science,"Problems that are carefully formulated lead students to develop more sufficient and realistic solutions. By front-loading the process of problem solving through problem formulation, students are able to reduce the amount of time spent on solution development, and thus increase their efficiency towards meeting their main objective. By teaching students problem formulation, especially in computer science related activities, foundational skills in computational thinking are introduced, used, and refined. Using a problem solving archetype as a means for this formulation is an effective tool for students to leverage. As computational thinking skills are honed, these concepts can translate across barriers into other content areas."
POLLAROLO2024100637,"Play with Coding Toys in Early Childhood Education and Care: Teachers’ Pedagogical Strategies, Views and Impact on Children's Development. A Systematic Literature Review","This paper presents a systematic literature review that aims to portray an overview of pedagogical strategies that Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) teachers adopt to support children’s play with coding toys. In addition, the article synthesizes findings about teachers’ views in relation to the use of coding toys in ECEC and describes the outputs that the existing literature identifies as children’s development after play activities with coding toys. The systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA-2020 statement, and the initial search across four databases (Eric, Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Research Ultimate) for papers published between January 2010 and May 2022 yielded 2672 peer-reviewed articles. Following the first evaluation, the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in a shortlist of 22 papers. The results show different strategies that the teachers can use during play activities with coding toys, assuming the roles of facilitators and mediators through collaborative work, allowing children to try and fail. Moreover, the results revealed that ECEC teachers largely hold positive and constructive attitudes towards the use of coding toys. Findings also highlight positive outcomes regarding children’s development across various cognitive and socio-emotional skills such as problem solving, computational thinking and communication. As an improvement, future studies should focus on identifying appropriate pedagogies that may be applied in tandem with the technology to maximise the pedagogical benefits for the children as well as adequate training for teachers."
BOCZAR2025102564,Refining nascent interventions through emergent design evaluation,"Evaluating nascent educational interventions requires a specific kind of evaluation theory. This paper provides a case example of the emergent design evaluation approach, one theory created for use with developing interventions, but that has limited examples within published literature for practitioners to learn from. The emergent design evaluation theory was used to evaluate the design and implementation of a high school biology unit integrating computational thinking and neural engineering, including teacher professional development and a web-based application. A contribution of this paper, beyond the case example it provides, is that the emergent design evaluation was combined with design-based research, a complementary approach. Consistent with the practices uniquely characteristic of emergent design evaluation, this paper describes critical points or key occasions in which aspects of the intervention influence the evaluation process, or vice versa, including the nature and direction of influence. By demonstrating the process of combining emergent design evaluation and design-based research, this paper adds to discussions within the field about how to intentionally weave together different knowledge generation approaches that both meet evaluation demands and align with the evaluation context."
FANG2025105264,Understanding the gender divide in digital literacy in four European countries: A comprehensive decomposition analysis using unconditional quantile regression,"Digital literacy is crucial for adolescents’ future, yet significant gender divides persist, particularly in Computer and Information Literacy (CIL) and Computational Thinking (CT). This study examines the gender divide in CIL and CT among adolescents in four European countries, highlighting the gender-based disparities in digital literacy development. Based on ICILS 2018 data, this research identifies factors contributing to gender divides in CIL and CT using regression and decomposition methods. Findings indicate that females outperform males in CIL, while males excel in CT. Gender divides decrease as the percentiles of students’ proficiency levels increase. The explained portion of the gender divide in CIL and CT is consistently smaller than the unexplained portion across countries, suggesting that gender divide or unobserved factors may drive these divides. A comparison of OLS regression results with decomposition approaches indicates that the factors influencing digital literacy development differ from those contributing to the gender divide. Variation in the factors contributing to gender divides is greater across countries than within countries for both CIL and CT. These findings highlight the need to consider national digital environments and socio-cultural contexts in addressing gender divides in digital literacy. This study offers insights for policymakers and educators to address the gender divide in digital literacy."
KONG2020103872,"Teacher development in computational thinking: Design and learning outcomes of programming concepts, practices and pedagogy","The implementation of effective professional development courses for K-12 teachers on computational thinking (CT) in relation to programming remains a challenge. There is a lack of high-quality empirical research on teacher development in CT in relation to programming. This study addressed that situation by providing empirical evidence of the design and evaluation of such a teacher development program in primary schools. Seventy-six in-service teachers participated in a program comprising two 39-h courses. One course focused on the fundamental subject knowledge of programming for CT development together with pedagogy. The other focused on the development of advanced knowledge while providing opportunities to practice teaching in the classroom and to reflect on the practice. The results indicate that the participants developed a better understanding of CT concepts and practices and improved in three of the four content knowledge related dimensions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) across the two courses. The three dimensions were content knowledge of programming for CT development, technological content knowledge of the use of block-based programming environments for programming for CT development, and use of the environment to teach programming for CT development with the appropriate pedagogy in context. Analysis of the participants' self-reported reflections suggested that the two courses and the teaching experience acquired during the prolonged second course were the two main sources of improvement. This study demonstrates the importance of providing an effective teacher development program with a focus on CT concepts and practices. The program offers teachers a sustained period in which to practice in the classroom and reflect on their teaching while developing their capacity to implement CT in relation to programming."
KASPERSEN2021100302,Towards a model of progression in computational empowerment in education,"In this paper, we present a model for progression in computational empowerment in education. Computational empowerment (CE) expands computational thinking (CT) by adding a focus on empowering citizens to critically engage with technology, but currently lacks an articulation of what characterises progression towards CE. Through combining aims from computational thinking with computational empowerment, and structure progression using the SOLO taxonomy, we take the first steps towards a model for understanding and articulating progression in computational empowerment. The model has been applied in the analysis of four CE-focused research projects. Based on the analysis, we propose that computational empowerment is a matter of reaching a high competency level regarding computational concepts, computational practices and reflexivity regarding the effect of technology in one’s own life and in society. Finally, by formulating examples of learning goals, we illustrate how the model can be used by teachers and researchers to articulate, determine and compare CE learning goals, so that learning goals are aligned and complement each other from one stage to the next."
RICH2021104196,Measuring the effect of continuous professional development on elementary teachers’ self-efficacy to teach coding and computational thinking,"Interest in coding education has exploded in the past five years, especially in elementary and early secondary education. Teachers who are largely new to coding are expected to guide entire student bodies through the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. But little is known about which coding and computational thinking (CT) concepts teachers feel most comfortable with and which concepts they struggle with. This study describes 127 elementary coding teachers’ changes in their beliefs about teaching coding and CT as they participated in year-long continuous professional development. Novice elementary coding teachers demonstrated most growth in their self-efficacy for teaching sequences, algorithms and loops. They were less secure in their knowledge of conditionals, variables, and functions. For computational thinking, teachers were most confident in their ability to identify patterns, think algorithmically, understand logic, and evaluate outcomes, showing less growth with decomposition and abstraction."
WEI2021104023,The effectiveness of partial pair programming on elementary school students’ Computational Thinking skills and self-efficacy,"Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming essential in all aspects of work and life, and CT has become part of the K-12 curriculum around the world. Yet, more research is needed to better understand how to help elementary school students acquire CT skills effectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of partial pair programming (PPP) on elementary school students' CT skills and self-efficacy (SE). The study included four 4th grade classes, with a total of 171 students, who were taking the course entitled “Computational Thinking with Scratch” with the same teacher for one semester. Two classes (84 students) were in the Experimental Group (EG, 44 boys and 40 girls) while two other classes (87 students) were in the Control Group (CG, 45 boys and 42 girls). The students in the EG were paired up for the programming assignments while the students in the CG did the assignments on their own. The results showed that the students in the EG improved their CT skills and SE more significantly than those in the CG group. There was a low correlation between CT and SE in the post-test of both groups. The interviews with the teacher and the students afterwards provided insights in understanding the results. The findings suggest that in K-12 programming teachers could use PPP as an effective approach to improve students’ CT skills, programming SE, and beyond."
OCAK2023100146,An AI-enhanced pattern recognition approach to temporal and spatial analysis of children's embodied interactions,"Multimodal video analysis is a complex and time-consuming process for a researcher; it entails capturing, watching, and re-watching video data to identify which segments best inform or address the questions that drive the research. Modern AI applications can alleviate the challenges that arise during the fine-grained analysis of learners' multimodal interactions captured through video. In this study, we present a supervised approach to training a deep neural network to analyze children's computational thinking (CT) captured through multimodal video data. The approach first uses a set of images extracted from video data to train the AI to map them to labels generated using a priori theory. Confusion matrices were used to establish the performance of the AI by comparing AI predictions to human analysis on a validation set of data. The findings suggested that the AI classified several aspects of children's CT in a way that was highly consistent with human analysis, demonstrating how the AI could serve as an additional team member during multimodal analysis. Implications for using AI to ease the challenges of multimodal analysis of video data are discussed."
PIERREROBERTSON2025695,Literacies,"This entry provides the definition, etymology and history of literacy. It comments on the expansion of literacy in the technological age to embrace new literacies. It then defines ten literacies that can be incorporated under the concept of new literacies. These are information literacy and associated literacies like digital literacy, digital media literacy, internet literacy, technology literacy, computer literacy, computational thinking, critical literacy, algorithmic literacy, and transliteracy. It touches on the importance of new literacies in today’s continuously evolving digital world and gives trends for the future, with specific reference to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The relevance of libraries and librarians concerning each of the literacies is included."
HSU2023104657,Effects of voice assistant creation using different learning approaches on performance of computational thinking,"Designing artificial intelligence (AI) artefact learning has gone beyond command-line-based instruction, to include a low-barrier threshold with block-based programming. Such instructional design must not solely emphasise AI workings. Rather, it must offer students computational thinking (CT) practice to support their AI-related artefact creation while reducing their AI anxiety about future job replacement or sociotechnical blindness. In this study, this research explored an experiential learning approach to improve CT along with AI application capabilities when engaging undergraduate students in creating a voice assistant application (VA app). A total of 56 students participated in the study. The control group (CG) of 26 students used a conventional subject-based learning method, while the experimental group (EG) of 30 students adopted an experiential learning method. This study aimed to examine the differences in the learning achievement of CT and AI concept, as well as the perspectives of AI anxiety, and CT; in the meanwhile, this study analysed the students' learning behaviours using sequential behavioural analysis to discuss the learning process. Results showed that the CT ability of the EG was better than that of the CG, although no significant difference was found between the two groups’ AI concepts and anxiety. The behaviour analysis also revealed that the EG students were willing to ask more questions, and conducted their VA evaluation, whereas the CG students were inclined to focus on the input and output of knowledge, and replicated what the teacher presented. Suggestions and implications are given for future research."
CHEVALIER2022104431,The role of feedback and guidance as intervention methods to foster computational thinking in educational robotics learning activities for primary school,"Computational thinking (CT) is considered an emerging competence domain linked to 21st-century competences, and educational robotics (ER) is increasingly recognised as a tool to develop CT competences. This is why researchers recommend developing intervention methods adapted to classroom practice and providing explicit guidelines to teachers on integrating ER activities. The present study thus addresses this challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report students' CT competence (their performance and learning process). Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students’ CT scores. Results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for CT development in ER activities. Subject to delayed feedback, students are better at formulating the robot behaviour to be programmed, and, thus, such a strategy reinforces the anticipation process underlying the CT."
RAPTI2025101849,"A bibliometric and content analysis of educational robotics’ impact on communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity in kindergarten","Communication, collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity are 21st-century skills required to be developed in educational settings from an early age. Robotics seems to contribute to that. Therefore, this study focuses on kindergarten and explores the current research trends regarding children’s development of these skills via robotics. It aims to a) construct links between the main factors in the existing research, b) map the related field, and identify gaps to enhance our understanding. In this context, a bibliometric analysis using the Bibliometrix package and CiteSpace and a content analysis utilizing the Atlas.ti Software is employed covering 203 of 3822 studies conducted between 2014 and December 2024. Based on the findings, the most frequently examined topics are social-anthropomorphic robots, human-robot interaction, and computational thinking under the umbrella of educational robotics and skills development. The highest publication performance belongs to the USA, Italy, Japan, China, and Greece. The strongest sources are ACM, IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, the Education and Information Technologies Journal, the International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction, and the Computers and Education Journal. Besides, Papert, Wing, and Bers arise as the most influential authors. Furthermore, most studies explore one or two C-skills, examining critical thinking the most and creativity the least during interventions focused on several domains but rarely on skills promotion. Moreover, most researchers choose the qualitative method, using small sample sizes, wheeled, floor robots, and various learning theories in short-term interventions. Finally, robots are utilized as assistive instruction kits, teammates, and educators’ assistants while children act as researchers-constructors."
KWON2025100253,"Gender disparities in K-12 computer science education: Status, contributing factors, and instructional approaches","This study conducts a systematic review of the literature to investigate gender disparities in K-12 computer science (CS) education. We selected articles published in peer-reviewed journals that focused on both cognitive and affective aspects of computational thinking and CS education at the primary and secondary levels. A total of 29 studies were reviewed, and their findings were synthesized to assess the status of gender disparities, contributing factors, and instructional approaches. The results indicated that gender differences in cognitive and affective dimensions of CS education become more evident as students advance through school, with a greater negative impact on girls. The review identified three interconnected factors contributing to these disparities: socio-cultural influences, educational environments, and individual psychological factors. Additionally, the study proposed instructional approaches to address these issues and recommended future research to fill the current gaps in CS education research."
TANG2020103798,Assessing computational thinking: A systematic review of empirical studies,"With the increasing attention to Computational Thinking (CT) in education, there has been a concomitant rise of needs and interest in investigating how to assess CT skills. This study systematically reviewed how CT has been assessed in the literature. We reviewed 96 journal articles to analyze specific CT assessments from four perspectives: educational context, assessment construct, assessment type, and reliability and validity evidence. Our review results indicate that (a) more CT assessments are needed for high school, college students, and teacher professional development programs, (b) most CT assessments focus on students' programming or computing skills, (c) traditional tests and performance assessments are often used to assess CT skills, and surveys are used to measure students’ CT dispositions, and (d) more reliability and validity evidence needs to be collected and reported in future studies. This review identifies current research gaps and future directions to conceptualize and assess CT skills, and the findings are expected to be beneficial for researchers, curriculum designers, and instructors."
ARNEDOMORENO2025100850,Programming Fun(damentals): Using commercial video games to teach basic coding to adult learners,"The acquisition of computational thinking and coding skills is of special significance in helping adult learners keep pace with a new context where those skills are required for many parts of the workforce. However, there is an agreement in the scientific literature that important challenges exist, such as keeping student engagement and the requirement of developing problem-solving skills, and not just learning the code syntax. The inclusion of digital Game-Based Learning (GBL) has shown great potential. To better understand how it can be helpful to adult learners in STEM degrees, a study was conducted on the application of two very popular commercial video games in different introductory programming courses at an online university, during the introduction of basic programming topics (CS1). The methods combined a descriptive qualitative and a quantitative approach, using a reflective journals and questionnaires, which helped students consider and express their experiences, how they interacted with the games, how the games helped them better understand the topics, and realize their personal progress and potential. Results showed that the use of these games as educational resources had a positive impact in their engagement and sense of self-efficacy, but only if some important instructional considerations are taken into account."
DIAGO2022100388,Exploring the development of mental rotation and computational skills in elementary students through educational robotics,"Interest in educational robotics has increased over the last decade. Through various approaches, robots are being used in the teaching and learning of different subjects at distinct education levels. The present study investigates the effects of an educational robotic intervention on the mental rotation and computational thinking assessment in a 3rd grade classroom. To this end, we carried out a quasi-experimental study involving 24 third-grade students. From an embodied approach, we have designed a two-hour intervention providing students with a physical environment to perform tangible programming on Bee-bot. The results revealed that this educational robotic proposal aimed at map-reading tasks leads to statistically significant gains in computational thinking. Moreover, students who followed the Bee-bot-based intervention achieved greater CT level compared to students following a traditional instruction approach, after controlling student’s prior level. No conclusive results were found in relation to mental rotation."
DELOLMOMUNOZ2020103832,Computational thinking through unplugged activities in early years of Primary Education,"The inclusion of computational thinking (CT) in the classroom is something that the present and future society is demanding. However, this domain remains largely unexplored, especially in the first years of Primary Education. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the inclusion of the so-called unplugged activities favours the development of CT in the students of the early years of Primary Education. To this end, a quasi-experimental study has been carried out to explore the eventual benefit of a mixed approach that combines both unplugged and plugged-in activities. In particular, 84 second-grade students took part in the experiment. Three questions were evaluated: the development of their CT skills, their motivation towards the proposed instruction, and the influence of students' gender in the two previous areas. The intervention was designed on a selection of activities extracted from Code.org courses, and was divided into two phases, one in which one group worked with unplugged activities and the other with plugged-in activities, and a second where both groups worked with plugged-in activities. Analysing the three proposed questions through tests performed before, in between and after the instruction, it is concluded that the inclusion of unplugged activities in the instruction seems beneficial taking into account CT, motivation and gender."
LUO2020103759,Exploring the evolution of two girls’ conceptions and practices in computational thinking in science,"As the definition of computational thinking (CT) in education continues to evolve, researchers have investigated the integration of CT in K-12 learning contexts and students' perceptions and development of CT in these integrated learning experiences. Drawing on prior work, this study explored the evolution of two elementary school girls’ conceptions and practices of CT in science as they participated in a four-week CT-integrated science unit at a summer camp using the Dash robot and the Blockly app. Three CT concepts: loops, sequences, and conditionals, were integrated into a unit on the reproduction cycle of flowerless plants. Observations, participant drawings, and analysis of Blockly code revealed that the children improved in their CT practices. In addition, the CT-integrated science unit developed for this study successfully engaged both participants, even when one expressed a low interest in science. The study suggested that defining computing vocabulary, using checkpoint activities with immediate and corrective feedback, and scaffolding of coding concepts with unplugged activities were particularly necessary in promoting CT and the integration of CT and science education in an elementary-level informal learning context."
KERT2020100714,"The effect of robotics on six graders’ academic achievement, computational thinking skills and conceptual knowledge levels","This study compared the pedagogical effects of educational robot development and the block-based programming perspectives, which are used in programming education, on middle school students. Its participants were 78 sixth graders. Considering the students’ preferences, 38 students were assigned to the experimental group, which studied with robotics (Lego EV3) sets, and 40 students were assigned to the control group, which studied with block-based programming environment (Scratch). All the topics of the programming unit, which are shown in the methods section, were taught to both groups for 10 weeks using the two different approaches. The change created by the implementation between the groups was tested for academic achievement, computational thinking skill efficacy perceptions, and conceptual knowledge levels. The results indicate that educational robotics develop middle school students’ academic achievement and computational thinking skill efficacy perceptions more effectively than block-based programming environments. The connections between the concepts of the students who did robotics were also found to be more solid than those who worked with block-based software."
ANGELI2020105954,Developing young children's computational thinking with educational robotics: An interaction effect between gender and scaffolding strategy,"The study examined the effects of learning with the Bee-Bot on young boys' and girls' computational thinking within the context of two scaffolding techniques. The study reports statistically significant learning gains between the initial and final assessment of children's computational thinking skills. Also, according to the findings, while both boys and girls benefited from the scaffolding techniques, a statistically significant interaction effect was detected between gender and scaffolding strategy showing that boys benefited more from the individualistic, kinesthetic, spatially-oriented, and manipulative-based activity with the cards, while girls benefited more from the collaborative writing activity. In regards to the children's problem-solving strategies during debugging, the results showed that the majority of them used decomposition as a strategy to deal with the complexity of the task. These results are important, because they show that children at this very young age are able to cope with the complexity of a learning task by decomposing it into a number of subtasks that are easier for them to tackle. The research contributes to the body of knowledge about the teaching of computational thinking. In addition, the study has practical significance for curriculum developers, instructional leaders, and classroom teachers, as they can use the results of this study to design curricula and classroom activities with a focus on the broader set of computational thinking skills, and not only coding."
JIN2024104114,DVRT: Design and evaluation of a virtual reality drone programming teaching system,"Virtual Reality (VR) is an immersive virtual environment generated through computer technology. VR teaching, by utilizing an immersive learning model, offers innovative learning methods for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education as well as programming education. This study developed a Drone Virtual Reality Teaching (DVRT) system aimed at beginners in drone operation and programming, with the goal of addressing the challenges in traditional drone and programming education, such as difficulty in engaging students and lack of practicality. Through the system's curriculum, students learn basic drone operation skills and advanced programming techniques. We conducted a course experiment primarily targeting undergraduate students who are beginners in drone operation. The test results showed that most students achieved scores above 4 out of 5, indicating that DVRT can effectively promote the development of users' comprehensive STEM literacy and computational thinking, thereby demonstrating the great potential of VR technology in STEM education. Through this innovative teaching method, students not only gain knowledge but also enjoy the fun of immersive learning."
KASPERSEN2022100539,High school students exploring machine learning and its societal implications: Opportunities and challenges,"The increased use of AI and machine learning (ML) calls for a general AI literacy, in particular regarding understanding how ML works, the process behind creating ML models, and reflecting on its implications. Where existing learning tools focus on the first two, we explore opportunities and challenges for meaningfully engaging students in understanding and reflecting on ML in their everyday life. We designed VotestratesML, following a Constructive Design Research approach, as an ethics-first learning tool that allow students to explore implications of ML for democratic elections. Based on deployments of VotestratesML in two high school social studies classrooms, we found that safely exploring ML from a concrete starting point helped students reflect and form opinions about its use, that promoting iterative exploration through collaboration and competition motivated them to explore, and that foregrounding ethics in the design and grounding ML in a well-known subject area allowed them to engage with ML on a personal level."
THEODOROPOULOS2022100525,Participatory design and participatory debugging: Listening to students to improve computational thinking by creating games,"Computational Thinking (CT) is considered a fundamental ability for the 21st century, since it develops problem-solving skills. Debugging is a key aspect of CT and by its very nature, closely related to the idea of problem-solving since it is the process of finding and resolving bugs within programs. Moreover, participatory methods expect a high degree of activity and personal involvement of participants in the learning process. This study explores Participatory Design (PD) and Participatory Debugging (PDeb) approaches by teaching CT skills in school secondary education level through (a) designing and developing games in App Inventor, following a PD process and (b) identifying bugs/failures in the code of games, following a PDeb approach. The idea in PDeb is to make students identify issues in their code in order to solve a problem, allowing them to discover new ways and ideas for creating mobile games. For this reason, 41 students took part into this study, in a series of 6 weekly workshops. The study provides guidelines for using PD and PDeb approaches to incorporate games into computing education more effectively. We search and discuss aspects of participatory debugging used in game-design for educational purposes, together with methodological limitations and recommendations for further work in this area."
BERS2023394,Coding as another language: Research-based curriculum for early childhood computer science,"This paper describes the iterative research and evaluation of the Coding as Another Language (CAL) curriculum that utilizes the free ScratchJr programming language in kindergarten to second grade. CAL was designed using principles of three theoretical frameworks: Curriculum Research Framework (CRF), which proposes different phases in the creation of research-based curriculum; Constructionism, which presents a computationally-rich project-based methodology based on identifying powerful ideas from a learning domain; and Positive Technological Development, which intentionally integrates socio-emotional and ethical dimensions into curricular experiences. The pedagogical foundation of CAL involves the understanding of coding as a literacy, that is, putting developmentally-appropriate powerful ideas of computer science in conversation with those taught in language arts. The paper first describes CAL and then presents results from both a pilot study and a cluster randomized controlled trial that set to evaluate CAL's feasibility and impact on students’ learning outcomes. Our findings showed that the CAL curriculum was not only feasible to implement, but also effective for improving coding skills. However, CAL's impact on computational thinking is less clear given that in the cluster randomized controlled trial, both the control and the intervention groups improved equally on a measure of computational thinking."
ASBELLCLARKE2021106587,"The development of students’ computational thinking practices in elementary- and middle-school classes using the learning game, Zoombinis","This paper reports on a research study of 45 classes in US schools (grades 3–8) using Zoombinis, a popular Computational Thinking (CT) learning game for ages 8 to adult. The study examined the relationship among student gameplay, related classroom activity, and the development of students’ CT practices in Zoombinis classes. A combination of research methods, including educational data-mining on game data logs, cluster analysis on teacher logs of classroom activity, and multilevel modeling, was used to determine the impact of the duration and nature of student gameplay, as well as the extent and nature of classroom activity, on student CT practices. Automated detectors of gameplay CT practices built for this research were significant predictors of external post-assessment scores, and thus show promise as implicit assessments of CT practices within gameplay. Students with high duration of gameplay and high gameplay CT practices scored highest on external post-assessment of CT practices, when accounting for pre-assessment scores. This research suggests that Zoombinis is an effective CT learning tool and CT assessment tool for elementary- and middle-school students."
LOVE2022100543,A screen-based or physical computing unit? Examining secondary students’ attitudes toward coding,"In recent years there has been a growing emphasis placed on access to computational thinking (CT) instruction for every K-12 student in the United States (U.S.). Concurrently, calls for integrating CT concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts have also increased. This is reflected by the inclusion of CT in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy. However, methods for teaching CT concepts within secondary level STEM courses vary drastically. Physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the U.S. in attempts to integrate CT within authentic STEM problem-solving contexts. Despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. A mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students’ attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. The results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and career/future use of computing concepts. Students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. Furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices. This study provides implications for improving physical computing instruction and integration within STEM education contexts."
TERROBA2021143,Education intervention using a ground robot with programmed directional controls: observational analysis of the development of computational thinking in early childhood education,"The present work presents an intervention proposal for the development of computational thinking in early childhood education, through the use of a ground robot with programmed directional controls. Within the use of observational methodology, an observation system has been designed that allows the analysis and interpretation of the behavior displayed in the performance of the intervention proposal. The reliability of the observation system has been guaranteed in the form of inter-observer agreement, calculated using Cohen’s (1960) Kappa coefficient. Within the theory of generalizability, the measurement plan [Categories] [Steps]/[Participants], has allowed to verify a high precision reliability of the generalization of the results. The operability of the observation system has been reflected in the regular behavior structures (T-patterns) detected -through the Theme software-, which have allowed characterizing difficulties in the assimilation of an incipient computational language related to the ability of spatial orientation and the sequencing capacity of children -situations involving turning and number of commands used in the sequence-.
Resumen
El presente artículo presenta una propuesta de intervención para el desarrollo del pensamiento computacional en Educación Infantil, mediante un robot de suelo con mandos de direccionalidad programada. En el seno de la metodología observacional, se ha diseñado un sistema de observación que permite el análisis e interpretación de la conducta desplegada en el desempeño de la propuesta de intervención. La fiabilidad del sistema de observación se ha garantizado en forma de concordancia interobservadores, calculada a través del coeficiente Kappa de Cohen (1960). En el seno de la teoría de la generalizabilidad, el plan de medida [Categorías] [Steps]/ [Participantes], han permitido constatar una elevada fiabilidad de precisión de generalización de los resultados. La operatividad del sistema de observación ha quedado reflejada en las estructuras regulares de conducta (T-patterns) detectadas -mediante el software Theme-, que han permitido caracterizar dificultades en la asimilación de un lenguaje computacional incipiente relacionadas con la capacidad de orientación espacial y la capacidad de secuenciación del niño -situaciones que implican giro y número de comandos empleados en la secuencia-."
ARSLANYILMAZ2023100414,Eye-gaze data to measure students’ attention to and comprehension of computational thinking concepts,"There is no agreed-upon assessment to evaluate learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs), and none of the previous ones analyzed students’ eye-gaze measures over CTCs. This study investigates use of eye-gaze data over various CTCs, and tests the validity of eye-gaze data as an effective assessment instrument to measure learning of CTCs. Students’ eye-gaze data (FD: Fixation Duration, SA: Saccade Amplitude, RF: Regression Frequency) over CTCs were collected and correlated over seven sessions. The eye-gaze data were also correlated with quiz scores to test its validity in evaluating learning of CTCs. There was a statistically significant correlation between RFs on conditionals CTC and sessions showing increased frequency of regression in attention to conditionals, and between FDs and quizzes indicating FDs’ validity in measuring the learning of CTCs. These results implicate that FDs are effective in assessing the learning of CTCs and students are revisiting conditionals more often as compared to other CTCs."
GUGGEMOS2021104060,On the predictors of computational thinking and its growth at the high-school level,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key 21st-century skill. This paper contributes to CT research by investigating CT predictors among upper secondary students in a longitudinal and natural classroom setting. The hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: student characteristics, home environment, and learning opportunities. CT is measured with the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), an established performance test. N = 202 high-school students, at three time points over one school year, act as the sample and latent growth curve modeling as the analysis method. CT self-concept, followed by reasoning skills and gender, show the strongest association with the level of CT. Computer literacy, followed by duration of computer use and formal learning opportunities during the school year, have the strongest association with CT growth. Variables from all three areas seem to be important for predicting either CT level or growth. An explained variance of 70.4% for CT level and 61.2% for CT growth might indicate a good trade-off between the comprehensiveness and parsimony of the conceptual framework. The findings contribute to a better understanding of CT as a construct and have implications for CT instruction, e.g., the role of computer science and motivation in CT learning."
XU2024100415,Measuring mutual engagement in the context of middle-school pair programming: Development and validation of a self-reported questionnaire,"With the increasing importance of equipping young learners with computational thinking skills through learning to code, pair programming has emerged as a prevalent collaborative learning strategy in this context. Successful pair programming interventions necessitate mutual engagement between partners within a dyad. However, the measurement of mutual engagement in dyadic collaborative learning remains an under-researched area. This research represents a foundational stage in bridging this gap by developing a comprehensive 20-item Pair-Programming Mutual Engagement Questionnaire (PPME-Q) as a measure of mutual engagement in pair programming at the activity level. The questionnaire was validated through a sample of 86 eighth-grade students. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the existence of a four-factor structure comprising of the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement factors. The findings demonstrate the validity (χ2/df = 1.32) and reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.888) of the PPME-Q, establishing it as an effective tool for assessing eighth graders' mutual engagement in pair programming activities. As this tool is in the nascent stages of development the measurement, we emphasize the need for further empirical studies to establish criterion validity. We also discuss the implications of these findings for future research and educational practices. This targeted instrument can then potentially be adapted or scaled to other age groups based on the insights gained."
WOLFENGAGEN2024101175,Computationally inspired cognitive modeling,"A computational approach to cognitive modeling is proposed. The computational model is a parametric construction that takes into account cognitive stages and transitions between them. The cognitive model enables the idea of information processes, from their birth and appearance in a scope, evolution and canceling out their existence and disappearing from the scope. Process habitats are Lawvere’s variable domains; inter-transition is based on the notion of channeled spreading of processes."
LIN2024,Developing a Cost-Effective Surgical Scheduling System Applying Lean Thinking and Toyota’s Methods for Surgery-Related Big Data for Improved Data Use in Hospitals: User-Centered Design Approach,"Background
Surgical scheduling is pivotal in managing daily surgical sequences, impacting patient experience and hospital resources significantly. With operating rooms costing approximately US $36 per minute, efficient scheduling is vital. However, global practices in surgical scheduling vary, largely due to challenges in predicting individual surgeon times for diverse patient conditions. Inspired by the Toyota Production System’s efficiency in addressing similar logistical challenges, we applied its principles as detailed in the book “Lean Thinking” by Womack and Jones, which identifies processes that do not meet customer needs as wasteful. This insight is critical in health care, where waste can compromise patient safety and medical quality.
Objective
This study aims to use lean thinking and Toyota methods to develop a more efficient surgical scheduling system that better aligns with user needs without additional financial burdens.
Methods
We implemented the 5 principles of the Toyota system: specifying value, identifying the value stream, enabling flow, establishing pull, and pursuing perfection. Value was defined in terms of meeting the customer’s needs, which in this context involved developing a responsive and efficient scheduling system. Our approach included 2 subsystems: one handling presurgery patient data and another for intraoperative and postoperative data. We identified inefficiencies in the presurgery data subsystem and responded by creating a comprehensive value stream map of the surgical process. We developed 2 Excel (Microsoft Corporation) macros using Visual Basic for Applications. The first calculated average surgery times from intra- or postoperative historic data, while the second estimated surgery durations and generated concise, visually engaging scheduling reports from presurgery data. We assessed the effectiveness of the new system by comparing task completion times and user satisfaction between the old and new systems.
Results
The implementation of the revised scheduling system significantly reduced the overall scheduling time from 301 seconds to 261 seconds (P=.02), with significant time reductions in the revised process from 99 seconds to 62 seconds (P<.001). Despite these improvements, approximately 21% of nurses preferred the older system for its familiarity. The new system protects patient data privacy and streamlines schedule dissemination through a secure LINE group (LY Corp), ensuring seamless flow. The design of the system allows for real-time updates and has been effectively monitoring surgical durations daily for over 3 years. The “pull” principle was demonstrated when an unplanned software issue prompted immediate, user-led troubleshooting, enhancing system reliability. Continuous improvement efforts are ongoing, except for the preoperative patient confirmation step, which requires further enhancement to ensure optimal patient safety.
Conclusions
Lean principles and Toyota’s methods, combined with computer programming, can revitalize surgical scheduling processes. They offer effective solutions for surgical scheduling challenges and enable the creation of a novel surgical scheduling system without incurring additional costs."

PALIATHANASIS2024101585,Dipole cosmology in fQ-gravity,"Symmetric teleparallel f(Q)-gravity allows for the presence of a perfect fluid with a tilted velocity in the Kantowski–Sachs geometry. In this dipole model, we consider an ideal gas and we investigate the evolution of the physical parameters. The tilt parameter is constrained by the nonlinear function f(Q) through the non-diagonal equations of the field equations. We find that the dynamics always reduce to the vacuum solutions of STEGR. This includes the Kasner universe, when no cosmological term is introduced by the f(Q) function, and the isotropic de Sitter universe, where fQ plays the role of the cosmological constant. In the extreme tilt limit, the universe is consistently anisotropic and accelerated. However, the final solution matches that of STEGR."
DU2023108546,"OSSCAR, an open platform for collaborative development of computational tools for education in science","In this paper we present the Open Software Services for Classrooms and Research (OSSCAR) platform. OSSCAR provides an open collaborative environment to develop and access educational resources in the form of web applications, for which various deployment methods are discussed and compared. To minimize efforts in the creation and use of new educational material, OSSCAR combines software tools that have emerged as standards with custom domain-specific ones. The technical solutions adopted to create and distribute content are described and motivated on the basis of reliability, sustainability, ease of uptake and use. Examples from courses in the domains of physics, chemistry, and materials science are shown to demonstrate the style and level of interactivity of typical applications. The tools presented are easy to use, and create a uniform and open environment exploitable by a large community of teachers, students, and researchers with the goal of facilitating learning and avoiding, when possible, duplication of efforts in creating teaching material. Contributions to expand the educational content of the OSSCAR project are welcome.

Program Title: OSSCAR Interactive Notebooks for Quantum Mechanics and Computational Materials Science CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/26py5zz9f8.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/osscar-org/quantum-mechanics Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: Python Nature of problem: Among others, computational courses (e.g. on quantum mechanics) can benefit from advanced interactive visualizations of the content. However, on the one hand it might be complicated for teachers to develop such interactive content; on the other hand, students need to be able to access very quickly and efficiently the content, reducing the time needed to install libraries and dependencies that might differ between courses. Solution method: Here, we developed interactive web applications to complement teaching and encourage computational thinking for courses in computational physics, chemistry and materials science, using Jupyter notebooks and their rendering as interactive web applications. The latter is powered by a combination of Voila, to hide code and convert notebooks into live web applications, and (existing or custom) Jupyter widgets to enable interactiveness. The code is ready to be deployed via a number of open approaches."
DASILVASOARES202349,Chapter Three - Exploring the potential of eye tracking on personalized learning and real-time feedback in modern education,"Eye tracking is one of the techniques used to investigate cognitive mechanisms involved in the school context, such as joint attention and visual perception. Eye tracker has portability, straightforward application, cost-effectiveness, and infant-friendly neuroimaging measures of cognitive processes such as attention, engagement, and learning. Furthermore, the ongoing software enhancements coupled with the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms have improved the precision of collecting eye movement data and simplified the calibration process. These characteristics make it plausible to consider eye-tracking technology a promising tool to assist the teaching-learning process in school routines. However, eye tracking needs to be explored more as an educational instrument for real-time classroom activities and teachers' feedback. This perspective article briefly presents the fundamentals of the eye-tracking technique and four illustrative examples of employing this method in everyday school life. The first application shows how eye tracker information may contribute to teacher assessment of students' computational thinking in coding classes. In the second and third illustrations, we discuss the additional information provided by the eye-tracker to the teacher assessing the student's strategies to solve fraction problems and chart interpretation. The last illustration demonstrates the potential of eye tracking to provide Real-time feedback on learning difficulties/disabilities. Thus, we highlight the potential of the eye tracker as a complementary tool to promote personalized education and discuss future perspectives. In conclusion, we suggest that an eye-tracking system could be helpful by providing real-time student gaze leading to immediate teacher interventions and metacognition strategies."
LIU2024100642,A systematic review on how educators teach AI in K-12 education,"Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) education in K-12 contexts, i.e., teaching students about AI, is critical to promote students' AI literacy. However, the state-of-the-art of AI education is not clear enough. To this end, this study reviewed 45 high-quality empirical studies on K-12 AI education over the past decade from both research and instruction perspectives. Regarding the research design, this study revealed the relationship between publication year, sample size, learning stage, educational setting, research method, research focus and duration. Regarding the instruction design, this study revealed the relationship between learning stage, pedagogical strategy, learning tool, learning activity, learning content, assessment method and learning effect. Besides, this study also derived recommendations for research (i.e., time allocation, samples selection, longitudinal design, rigorous methodology and technical democracy) and instruction (i.e., group learning, authentic context, teacher involvement, triangular evidence and learning scaffolding). Overall, the main findings indicate that K-12 AI education has the potential to develop students’ AI literacy, which contains AI knowledge, AI affectivity, and AI thinking. However, deficiencies in research and instructional design still remain, including short durations, small sample sizes, non-standardized research methods, lack of long-term and cross-age AI curriculum, etc. This study also discussed several critical topics for future research and instruction."
ANDERSEN2023100576,The situated power of computational empowerment,"Processes of computational empowerment necessarily involve changing the relationships of power between children, digital technologies, and social contexts. However, research into computational empowerment rarely explicates a theory of power nor reflects on the dynamics of power implicated in attempts at empowerment. The purpose of this article is thus to investigate the problem of power in computational empowerment. The method applied is one of empirical philosophy. The article utilizes three paradigmatic cases describing how the power of computational empowerment is a matter of situated knowledge and agency, an outcome of invisible work, and a question of ontological politics."

El presente artículo presenta una propuesta de intervención para el desarrollo del pensamiento computacional en educación infantil, mediante un robot de suelo con mandos de direccionalidad programada. En el seno de la metodología observacional, se ha diseñado un sistema de observación que permite el análisis e interpretación de la conducta desplegada en el desempeño de la propuesta de intervención. La fiabilidad del sistema de observación se ha garantizado en forma de concordancia interobservadores, calculada a través del coeficiente Kappa de Cohen (1960). En el seno de la teoría de la generalizabilidad, el plan de medida [Categorías] [Steps]/ [Participantes] ha permitido constatar una elevada fiabilidad de precisión de generalización de los resultados. La operatividad del sistema de observación ha quedado reflejada en las estructuras regulares de conducta (T-patterns) detectadas -mediante el software THEME-, que han permitido caracterizar dificultades en la asimilación de un lenguaje computacional incipiente relacionadas con la capacidad de orientación espacial y la capacidad de secuenciación del niño -situaciones que implican giro y número de comandos empleados en la secuencia-.
The present work presents an intervention proposal for the development of computational thinking in early childhood education, through the use of a ground robot with programmed directional controls. Within the use of observational methodology, an observation system has been designed that allows the analysis and interpretation of the behavior displayed in the performance of the intervention proposal. The reliability of the observation system has been guaranteed in the form of inter-observer agreement, calculated using Cohen's (1960) Kappa coefficient. Within the theory of generalizability, the measurement plan [Categories] [Steps] / [Participants] has allowed to verify a high precision reliability of the generalization of the results. The operability of the observation system has been reflected in the regular behavior structures (T-patterns) detected -through the THEME software-, which have allowed characterizing difficulties in the assimilation of an incipient computational language related to the ability of spatial orientation and the sequencing capacity of children -situations involving turning and number of commands used in the sequence-."
GU2024825,Enhancing campus OS community engagement through the miniOS pilot class: A nine-year journey,"Recognized as the crown jewel of system software, Operating System (OS) is notoriously challenging to teach and learn, given its abstract concepts, broad scope, and the imperative for hands-on experience. How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. Instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving miniOS kernel—a witness to the collective effort of each class. Since its inception in 2015, the miniOS pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the OS community engagement on campus. Through this initiative, we have gleaned six key insights and six lessons, which we are eager to share with the broader educational community."
NKONGOLO2022182,Using Deep Packet Inspection Data to Examine Subscribers on the Network,"This article proposes the creation of the deep packet inspection (DPI) dataset to study subscribers’ behavior on the network, applying ensemble learning to this dataset, and comparing it with the UGRansome dataset. The subscriber can be thought of as a person or a group of users using a network service or connectivity. The DPI features represent the subscriber network usage, and the ensemble learning approach is implemented on the DPI dataset to predict the subscriber's service category on the network. The classification and prediction problem addressed on the DPI dataset reached a precision of 100%. The paper predicts that the web and streaming categories with Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube services will be the most utilized in the next few years. This study will lead to a better understanding of the idiosyncratic behavior of active subscribers on the network, exposing novel network anomalies and facilitating the development of novel DPI systems."
NG2024100090,Using cospaces in augmented reality digital story creation: A thematic analysis,"With the digital affordances of augmented reality (AR) technologies, research has shown their value for contextualized, interactive and collaborative language learning through supporting real-world immersion. In recent years, CoSpaces has been a popular AR learning tool with an extensive library of 3D models and constructive gadgets, as well as a visual programming platform. With this tool, students can create projects of digital stories by building personalized AR artifacts, scenes, and storylines, and then share their projects in a dynamic and global community of children. This study examined the characteristics of 39 selected CoSpaces’ open projects via thematic analysis and categorization into five learning contexts: (1) art, history, culture and design, (2) STEM, (3) classroom English and everyday communication, (4) fairy tale/literature, and (5) campus tour. Furthermore, this study identified six language learning competencies derived from digital story creation: (1) discovering knowledge, (2) connecting to prior experience and knowledge, (3) conducting research, (4) problem-solving, (5) expressing and creating digitally, as well as (6) presenting, appreciating and evaluating. Digital literacy refers to the ability to use technology to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information. In addition, three major types of digital literacy skills necessary for AR digital storytelling processes have been identified, encompassing digital creativity, technoligcal proficiency, and research skills. Our results contribute to discovering educational values in developing digital language competency through AR digital story creation. Recommendations are offered for future research and for educators to design appropriate AR learning experiences."
GENTILE20221,The role of mental rotation in TetrisTM gameplay: An ACT-R computational cognitive model,"The mental rotation ability is an essential spatial reasoning skill in human cognition and has proven to be an essential predictor of mathematical and STEM skills, critical and computational thinking. Despite its importance, little is known about when and how mental rotation processes are activated in games explicitly targeting spatial reasoning tasks. In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. In this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the TetrisTM game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an ACT-R based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness."
VIDENOVIK2024100616,Game-based learning approach in computer science in primary education: A systematic review,"This paper reviews the current situation concerning the implementation of game-based learning in computer science in primary education, providing insight into current trends, identifying strengths and potential research topics. Articles published in four databases from 2017 to 2021 are included in the analysis and an in-depth analysis of 32 articles is done. Different types of games, implemented in various educational contexts, are presented in these articles. Most of them describe implemented methodology, game-based environment or are evaluating the effectiveness of the created game or the approach.

SHOFIYAH2025101534,The use of technology to scientific reasoning in science education: A bibliometric and content analysis of research papers,"The results of several empirical findings show that the use of technology in science learning has a very positive influence on the development of students' scientific reasoning and is worthy of further development. This study aims to evaluate and map the use of technology in learning scientific reasoning in the context of science education through bibliometric of 119 articles and content analysis of 17 articles published from 2012 to 2024. The findings reveal fluctuations in research productivity, with a peak in 2022 driven by increased reliance on technology following the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States dominates contributions to this field, accounting for nearly half of the total publications, while emerging nations like Indonesia demonstrate significant potential for growth. Co-occurrence analysis identifies five thematic clusters, highlighting cognitive skills, curriculum design, and emerging tools such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and game-based learning. Content analysis shows that quantitative methods, particularly true-experimental designs, are the most common, with secondary school students (47 %) as the primary sample group. Achievement tests are the predominant data collection method, often complemented by observations and surveys for comprehensive insights. The focus on physics as the most studied subject (35 %) underscores its versatility, while multidisciplinary studies reveal a growing interest in sustainability, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The implication of the findings of this research is that future researchers are expected to be able to discover new areas and develop new technologies that are appropriate in science learning to improve scientific reasoning."
BEHERA2024103765,Assessing the intention to adopt computational intelligence in interactive marketing,"Interactive marketing (IM) can be used by e-commerce businesses to provide interactive and personalised experiences to e-customers by building sustainable relationships and delivering value. Computational intelligence (CI) is the ability of a machine to learn specific tasks via data or experimental observation for understanding and analysing customer behavioural patterns. Thus, this study explores how e-customers may intend to adopt CI in e-commerce within the boundaries of IM. Using online surveys, the primary data were collected from 315 e-customers of e-commerce businesses. Subsequently, the quantitative approach was used to analyse the data. The finding reveals that using a variety of techniques such as fuzzy logic, learning theory, evolutionary computation, genetic algorithms, and deep learning, CI predicts e-customer behaviour in a changing environment. Such a prediction results in desirable impacts, including more successful IM campaigns and retention actions. Further, CI uses a computational thinking approach, including the specification of the problem, algorithmic expression, solution implementation, and solution evaluation, for the identification and classification of stock-keeping units. This allows e-customers to compare the attributes of similar products."
BRIAN2023129074,Introducing mindset streams to investigate stances towards STEM in high school students and experts,"We introduce mindset streams for assessing ways of bridging two target concepts in concept maps. We focus on behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMN), which map the associative and affective dimensions of memory recalls. Inspired by trains of thoughts taking several paths to link ideas, mindset streams are defined as BFMN subgraphs induced by all shortest paths between two target concepts, e.g. all recalls in shortest paths bridging “math” and “learning”. These streams quantify the following features of the mindset encoded in a BFMN: (i) semantic content (i.e. which ideas mediate connections between targets?), (ii) valence coherence/conflict (i.e. are connections mediated by entwining ideas perceived negatively, positively or neutrally?), and (iii) semantic relevance (i.e. are the bridges between targets peripheral or central for the connectivity/betweenness of the BFMN?). We investigate mindset streams between ‘maths”/“physics” and key motivational aspects of learning (“fun”, “work”, “failure”) in two BFMNs, encoding how 159 students and 59 experts perceived and associated concepts about Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM), respectively. Statistical comparisons against configuration models show that high schoolers bridge “maths” and “fun” only through overabundant levels of valence-conflicting associations, contrasting negatively perceived domain knowledge with peer-related positive experiences. This conflict is absent in the researchers’ mindset stream, which rather bridges “math” and “fun” through positive, science-related associations. The mindset streams of both groups bridge “maths” and “physics” to “work” through mostly positive career-related jargon. Students’ mindset streams of “failure” and “math”/“physics” are dominated by negative associations with test anxiety, whereas researchers integrate “failure” and “math”/“physics” in semantically richer and more positive contexts, denoting failure itself as a cornerstone of STEM learning. We discuss our findings and future research directions in view of relevant psychology/education literature."
XU2025100685,Robotic roles in education: A systematic review based on a proposed framework of the learner-robot relationships,"With the development of computer and information techniques, robotics education provides potential to reshape the instructional and learning process in the educational system. From the perspective of the educational system, it is essential to understand the roles of robotics in education as well as their relationships with learners. Specifically, this systematic review proposed a conceptual framework based on two dimensions (i.e., learner agency, robotic interactivity) and reviewed 92 empirical studies from 2010 to 2023 to clarify four categories of robotic roles, namely learning about robotics, learning through robotics, learning from robotics, and learning with robotics. In learning about robotics, educational robotics are merely the learning objects or contents by learners. In learning through robotics, educational robotics serve as the learning tools or assists, and learners can take their agency to operate or design robotics. In learning from robotics, educational robotics act as tutors to convey and deliver knowledge and information to learners. In learning with robotics, educational robotics serve as the peers or companions of learners and collaborate with learners to provide emotional supports, solve problems and construct knowledge. Furthermore, this study examined the applied educational contexts (i.e., educational domain, educational level) and learning effects of the four robotic roles. Overall, the future development of robotics education highlights both learner agency and robotic interactivity to achieve the goal of a learner-centered, robot-friendly learning."

To facilitate meaningful learning experiences, educators frequently integrated hands-on activities and project-based learning. The findings supported the benefits of AI education in enhancing students' AI literacy, problem-solving skills, and ethical reflections on AI's societal impact. Furthermore, it fostered motivation, positive attitudes toward AI, and an interest in technology while inspiring career aspirations. It is recommended to develop tailored AI curricula, instructional strategies, and appropriate tools and resources that seamlessly integrate into various subjects within the standard school curriculum."
ZHANG2024101412,Predicting the Mathematics Literacy of Resilient Students from High‐performing Economies: A Machine Learning Approach,"Mathematics is a crucial yet challenging subject for all students. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of academic resilience in mathematics, which enables students to overcome academic challenges. This study applied two machine learning algorithms, Lasso Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF), to predict the mathematics literacy of resilient students from high-performing economies across cultures in PISA 2022. The findings indicated both RF and LR performed better in Western cultures than in Eastern cultures. Furthermore, in Eastern cultures, mathematics self-efficacy for 21st-century skills played an important role in predicting resilient students’ mathematics literacy, followed by self-efficacy towards mathematics, and mathematics anxiety. In Western cultures, self-efficacy towards mathematics was the predominant predictor, followed by mathematics self-efficacy for 21st-century skills. Theoretically, this study identifies key factors in predicting resilient students’ mathematics literacy across cultures. Methodologically, it is the first to apply ML in exploring resilient students’ mathematics literacy. Practically, it guides educators interested in developing interventions to improve resilient students’ mathematics literacy."
LIN2024101450,Exploring the impact of design thinking in information technology education: An empirical investigation,"In the context of digital transformation, educators are seeking ways to guide students to become innovative technology designers. However, students often lack innovative problem-solving skills when working with IT, and so new pedagogies are needed to improve IT-related curricula. Design thinking (DT), as a methodology, may offer the potential to meet this need. The present study developed a DT-based framework for the design of IT learning projects. A quasi-experiment was conducted in a junior middle school, employing both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to explore the impact of DT on learning outcomes and mechanisms that explain the observed changes in student performance. The findings demonstrate that DT promotes creativity in students’ digital works, especially their value, diversity, and originality. DT also enhances students’ awareness of using IT to address daily challenges and facilitates their basic information knowledge and skills. Regarding the mechanisms, the DT process and tools serve as learning scaffolds and facilitate the creativity of digital work. The Ideate of DT generates ideas on what to do and how to do it. Empathize and Define establish a link between digital work and real-life problems. Prototype and Test help students acquire basic information knowledge and skills. This study not only examines the impact of DT on IT education but also explores the mechanisms to explain the observed changes in learning performance. The findings can serve as a guide for educators and researchers to further optimize the teaching of IT courses and nurture innovative talents required in the new era."
HE2025105245,A systematic review of the use of log-based process data in computer-based assessments,"In recent decades, log-based process data has been increasingly used in computer-based assessments to examine test-takers' response patterns and latent traits. This study provides a systematic review of the use of log-based process data in computer-based assessments. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline, we identified 2548 publications, of which 330 were finally included in this study after careful screening and full-text review. The results of this study can assist researchers in better understanding: (1) what are the trends in using log-based process data in computer-based assessments, (2) which process indicators have been constructed from raw log files, (3) what latent constructs have been inferred from process indicators and at what inferential levels, and (4) what are the benefits, challenges, and future recommendations for using log-based process data. By examining these questions, we conclude that the use of log-based process data in computer-based assessment shows many potentials for enhancing the assessment. Therefore, more study using log-based process data in various fields is encouraged to better understand test-takers’ underlying response processes during assessments. Additionally, there is also a considerable demand for validating process indicators and the generalizability of findings."
WOLFENGAGEN2024101185,Semantic configuration model with natural transformations,"In the present work, efforts have been made to create a configuration-based approach to knowledge extraction. The notion of granularity is developed, which allows fine-tuning the expressive possibilities of the semantic network. As known, the central issues for knowledge-based systems are what’s-in-a-node and what’s-in-a-link. As shown, the answer can be obtained from the functor-as-object representation. Then the nodes are functors, and the main links are natural transformations. Such a model is applicable to represent morphing, and the object is considered as a process, which is in a harmony with current ideas on computing. It is possible to represent information channels that carry out the transformations of processes. The possibility of generating displaced concepts and the generation of families of their morphs is shown, the evolvent of stages of knowledge and properties of the process serve as parameters."
ZAHOOR2025100931,Child computer interactions: Cognitive development and segmenting unsafe video contents: A review,"Computer Technology (CT) is now an integral part of our daily lives, influencing various aspects of human activity, particularly those of children. Child Computer Interactions a specialized area within CT, focuses on enhancing children’s physical activities, psychology, education, and communication through diverse computer applications. CCI is a steadily growing field that focuses on children as a prominent and emergent user group. This review article highlights the lack of research regarding the effective use of CCI technologies to promote cognitive development while reducing the risks linked to harmful digital content. The paper systematically examines the influence of CCI technologies on the cognitive development of children aged 0 to 12 years, addressing the research problem of inadequate filtering methods for unsafe video content that children are exposed to in today’s screen-dominated environment. It highlights how technological innovations, particularly in gaming, artificial intelligence, and media applications, are designed to enhance children’s skills while safeguarding their digital environment. A critical aspect of this review is the assessment of methods to filter and mitigate exposure to unsafe video content, a growing concern in today’s screen-dominated environment. The findings reveal that CCI programs significantly enhance children’s knowledge and skills with high accuracy. Moreover, the review underscores the importance of machine ethics in guiding the moral behavior of machines and ensuring the usability and safety of these technologies. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the role of CCI in fostering cognitive development and protecting children from inappropriate content."
CAKIROGLU2021100888,Understanding students’ abstractions in block-based programming environments: A performance based evaluation,"Providing computational problems for enhancing students’ abstraction skills and monitoring how students make abstractions is difficult in block-based programming environments (BBPEs). Thus, concrete examples and principles are needed to guide computer science teachers about understanding and enhancing students’ abstractions. This study aims to examine the effect of using block-based coding environments on enhancing secondary school students’ abstraction skills. Referring to the programming knowledge, a rubric was created to analyze the data from screen recordings, observation and interviews were used together to reveal the students’ abstraction performances. The results suggested that students performed high in elimination, focusing and generalization; however, students’ performances were relatively low in customization. Students’ explanations were mostly related the nature of the problems, affordances of BBPE and the programming constructs used in coding. We hope the study will provide insights for the efforts on instructional designs for successful abstraction experiences for young students."
DIAZ2021247,Evaluating Aspects of Usability in Video Game-Based Programming Learning Platforms,"Teaching computer programming is an important topic. Due to Science and Technology initiatives, these topics are considered in different training cycles. For higher education, students must cultivate fundamental concepts for the development of software applications, which not only contribute to the knowledge of programming languages but also to opening guidelines for computational thinking. However, selecting a proper tool can be complex. Especially for the diversity of alternatives on the web. Further, not all of them meet basic usability requirements. In this study, we present a set of platforms that seek to develop programming skills based on video games. The search consisted of 4 stages: (i) definition of the research questions, (ii) scope review, (iii) execution of search and (iv) platform selection. Finally, we employ a usability heuristic evaluation for a novice programming system to determine best practices."
LEHMANN2023101079,Using algorithmic thinking to design algorithms: The case of critical path analysis,"Algorithmic thinking is emerging as an important competence in mathematics education, yet research appears to be lagging this shift in curricular focus. The aim of this generative study is to examine how students use the cognitive skills of algorithmic thinking to design algorithms. Task-based interviews were conducted with four pairs of Year 12 students (n = 8) to analyze how they used decomposition and abstraction to specify the projects, designed algorithms to solve scheduling problems by first devising fundamental operations and then using algorithmic concepts to account for complex and special cases of the problems, and tested and debugged their algorithms. A deductive-inductive analytical process was used to classify students’ responses according to the four cognitive skills to develop sets of subskills to describe how the students engaged these cognitive skills."
YAMAGUCHI2023427,Equitable STEM+CS learning experiences for girls of color: nurturing an independent learning approach via a learning ecosystem,"Purpose
There is a critical need to understand how to attract Black girls and other girls of color to the science, technology, engineering, math, and computer science (STEM+CS) field. This study aims to look at the design and implementation of a CS learning ecosystem that supports girls of color in acquiring critical CS skills starting in middle school.
Design/methodology/approach
This mixed-method case study included 53 girls, between the ages of 11 and 13, in four US middle schools. Study methods included the analysis of a pre-program student survey, longitudinal interviews and focus groups, weekly observations and computing artifacts.
Findings
Program participants were interested in CS, were confident in their ability to learn CS, had prior coding and CS experience and had parents and teachers who encouraged them to learn CS. But some students showed dependent learning behaviors while engaging in CS activities. These included relying on instructors and being reticent to make mistakes–behaviors that limit learning. The CS learning ecosystem supported students as they shifted from applying dependent learning approaches to applying independent learning approaches. Instructors sustained a growth mindset and supported productive struggle as students learned CS skills.
Originality/value
A CS learning system supported equitable learning experiences and helped students develop independent learning behaviors that led to deeper engagement in CS."
YIM2024100321,Artificial intelligence literacy in primary education: An arts-based approach to overcoming age and gender barriers,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy education was previously taught primarily at the university and secondary school levels but has recently started to be expanded to primary school settings. When available at the primary school level, AI literacy is often taught within computer science courses, which may potentially reinforce gender stereotypes and discourage female students' engagement. In AI literacy education, the predominant teaching methods are constructivist approaches, which, while effective in fostering active learning, heavily emphasize technical skills and are therefore limited in their pedagogical scope, as they underplay other important questions, such as disinformation, data justice, and AI's ethical and societal implications. The lack of a clear definition of AI literacy for primary education also raises questions about what to teach and how to teach it. Additionally, little attention has been devoted to understanding gender differences in learning outcomes within AI literacy primary education. This study advocates the use of an arts-based transdisciplinary approach for teaching AI literacy to 25 primary school students. A pilot study utilizing mixed methods was conducted to assess the effectiveness of this arts-based approach. Quantitative analysis through a paired t-test revealed a statistically significant improvement in AI literacy among students participating in knowledge tests. Moreover, the results of the Mann‒Whitney and Kruskal‒Wallis tests indicated that gender and age did not impact pre- and post-knowledge test scores. Qualitative analyses further revealed the pedagogical benefits of the arts-based approach, demonstrating that students enhance their conceptual understanding of AI literacy by reflecting on their artifacts. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence with a small sample size that the arts-based approach can overcome age and gender barriers to accessing AI literacy education and can serve as a means to teach AI thinking."
JOHNSON2022105743,Metacognition for artificial intelligence system safety – An approach to safe and desired behavior,"Advances in computational thinking and data science have led to a new era of artificial intelligence systems being engineered to adapt to complex situations and develop actionable knowledge. These learning systems are meant to reliably understand the essence of a situation and construct critical decision recommendations to support autonomous and human–machine teaming operations. In parallel, the increasing volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, and variability of data is confounding the complexity of these new systems – creating challenges in terms of their development and implementation. For artificial systems supporting critical decisions with higher consequences, safety has become an important concern. Methods are needed to avoid failure modes and ensure that only desired behavior is permitted. This paper discusses an approach that promotes self-awareness, or metacognition, within the artificial intelligence systems to understand their external and internal operational environments and use this knowledge to identify potential failures and enable self-healing and self-management for safe and desired behavior."
JOO2024226,Teaching and Learning Model for Artificial Intelligence Education,"AI education aims to nurture convergence talents equipped with various knowledge and AI capabilities. However, the educational programs developed so far are designed for less than 10 sessions. This is insufficient time for students to understand artificial intelligence algorithms, utilize the learned principles of artificial intelligence, and expand by converging with various knowledge. Since the developmental characteristics of students in the lower grades of elementary school are different, it is difficult to apply them as they are. Therefore, it is necessary to study the following AI education teaching and learning methods suitable for lower grade students. In this study, we develop a teaching system design model for artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education for elementary school students in the lower grades, and based on this, design and apply an artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education program. Experiments were conducted with 47 second-year elementary school students, and students’ responses were better in the AI-based convergence education program than in general subject classes in terms of interest, understanding, and expectations for classes."
BESTER2024820,Complementary conservation of South African crop wild relatives for plant improvement,"Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) are good sources of unexplored genetic diversity that can assist plant breeders to increase the yield and resilience of their crops. These species are valuable plant genetic resources (PGR) that have been used in more than 4,157 documented cases of plant improvement to date. South Africa has 258 prioritized CWR, selected based on their distribution, threat status and potential as gene donors. In light of ongoing habitat destruction, global warming and mismanagement of resources, the conservation of these PGR is vital. Complementary conservation approaches allow for the continuous development of CWR, while harnessing and applying the available diversity in plant breeding programs. The South African National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) strives to utilize conservation resources to build and maintain an effective complementary, in situ to ex situ conservation pipeline. As part of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), South Africa has access to numerous resources that can assist to protect its rich floral diversity, including the SADC Plant Genetic Resource Centre (SPGRC), the SADC CWR Project and CAPFITOGEN3."
VERDUZCO2022103189,CALRECOD — A software for Computed Aided Learning of REinforced COncrete structural Design,"It is presented the development and implementation of a new computed aided learning MatLab Toolbox for the design of reinforced concrete structures named as CALRECOD for their abbreviation Computer Aided Learning of Reinforced Concrete Design. Such development emerges as the result of a series of research works in the Autonomous University of Queretaro with the main purpose of improving the way in which the design of reinforced concrete structures is taught in high education institutions. CALRECOD uses optimization methods and algorithms to aid students in their design interaction learning so that they are able to compare their own designs and what commercial software delivers with optimal ones given certain load conditions on the elements or structures. The software consists almost entirely of MatLab functions (.m files) and the ACI 318-19 code is taken as their main design reference to make it internationally useful, although in some cases the Mexican code NTC-17 specifications are used. Besides MatLab functions, the software consists as well of ANSYS SpaceClaim script functions (.scscript files) as an additional tool for the aid in the visualization of design results in a 3D space in the software ANSYS SpaceClaim. CALRECOD has proven to be versatile, flexible and of easy use with a huge potential to increase learning outcomes for students in high education programs related with the design of reinforced concrete structures as well as to enhance the creation of efficient interactive environments for researchers and academics focused on the development of new design and analysis methods for such structures. With their optimization design functions, a solid comparison platform of designs’ performance could be laid out, and with its extended function design packages for structural systems, reinforced concrete design courses could be enhanced in a great deal regarding their program content’s scope. The software can be found at: https://github.com/calrecod/CALRECOD."
VARTIAINEN2020100182,Learning machine learning with very young children: Who is teaching whom?,"While artificial intelligence and machine learning is becoming a commonplace feature of people’s everyday lives, so far few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating it in K-12​ education. Drawing on the sociocultural theory of learning and participation, this case study explored how six very young children taught and explored Google’s Teachable Machine in nonschool settings. Through fine-grained analysis of video recordings and interviews with the children, the article illustrates the content and the process of teaching where 3–9 year old children were producing machine learning data sets and models as well as observing, exploring, and explaining their own interaction with machine learning systems. The results illustrate the quick-paced and embodied nature of the child-computer interaction that also supported children to reason about the relationship between their own bodily expressions and the output of an interactive ML-based tool. The article concludes with discussions on the emergent process of teaching and learning as well as on ways of promoting children’s participation and sense of agency in the age of machine learning."
BENSASSI20233123,Fuzzy knowledge based assessment system for K-12 Scientific Reasoning Competencies,"Developing Scientific Reasoning (SR) competencies at an early age, are challenging to meet expectation of the 4th sustainable development goal. Hence, educators and educational decision-makers try to embed these competencies into such subjects as the arts, language, technology, economics, mathematics and science, using an inter-disciplinary approach. In this context, this paper proposes a fuzzy knowledge-based solution to build practical pupils, educators, and decision-makers recommender system to support the development of SR competencies in a data driver manner. Our system consists of:(1) inferring and computational module that calculates in a fuzzy manner the global appreciation to each SR-competencies. (2) recommendation module that aims to help learners, educators and decision makers to assess the degree of development of SR competencies and to get alternative suggestion of remediation. The proposed solution has been tested on the last two levels of science education in four Tunisian elementary schools in different regions. A preliminary analysis showed that the learning process should be more focused on Tunisian pupil's profile, and that investigation and collaborative based learning should be applied further in Tunisian classroom."
DINDLER2023100599,DORIT: An analytical model for computational empowerment in K-9 education,"This paper presents and explores an analytical, research-based model for computational empowerment in K-9 education. The model, entitled DORIT (“Do your Own Research In Technology”), contributes to Child–Computer Interaction research by providing scaffolding for teachers to create teaching activities emphasising a critical inquiry approach to computational empowerment. We present the DORIT model, its research base and report from a study where 18 in-service teachers took part in codesigning and testing lesson plans based on the model for grades 1, 6, 7 and 9. The lesson plans serve as proof-of-concept demonstrations of how the DORIT model can scaffold teaching activities. We further analyse how the teachers used the model in practice, and report from post-interviews with the teachers regarding their experiences with the model. We conclude the paper by discussing the potentials and challenges of the DORIT model to support computational empowerment in future CCI research."
MAKUMBI2025,Archaeal genomes linked to industrial wastewater and associated freshwater in South Africa,"ABSTRACT

Archaea provide important ecosystem services including the degradation of contaminants.

THOMPSON2024939,Leveraging marine biotechnology for an All-Atlantic sustainable blue economy,"Despite the lack of research, development, and innovation funds, especially in South Atlantic countries, the Atlantic is suited to supporting a sustainable marine bioeconomy. Novel low-carbon mariculture systems can provide food security, new drugs, and climate mitigation. We suggest how to develop this sustainable marine bioeconomy across the entire Atlantic."
THOMPSON2021104336,The impact of learning to code on elementary students’ writing skills,"The purpose of this research was to investigate how learning to code, using Google's CS First's Storytelling lessons, impacted elementary students' writing skills, writing stamina, and perceptions of writing abilities. In this mixed methods study, 49 fifth grade students participated in Google's CS First's Storytelling lessons focused on developing stories through coding during a school district's summer program. Fifth grade students (elementary level) completed pre- and post-writing assessments to measure 1) overall writing skills, 2) development of ideas, writing organization, grammar and usage, and mechanics, and 3) writing stamina. After completing the lessons and assessments, 10 students participated in a semi-structured interview to document perceptions of their writing abilities and engagement in writing. The results of this study show there was a significant increase in the overall scores on a pre- and post-writing assessment as well as writing stamina, and the interviews revealed that students were motivated in the storytelling process through narrative writing. The findings of this study support the implementation of coding programs as a tool for classroom instruction and the promotion of the development of writing skills for elementary students."

VAHLDICK2020100037,A blocks-based serious game to support introductory computer programming in undergraduate education,"Blocks-based environments have been used to promote computational thinking (CT) and programming learning mostly in elementary and middle schools. In many countries, like Brazil and Portugal, isolated initiatives have been launched to promote CT learning, but until now there is no evidence of a widespread use of this type of environments. Consequently, it is not common that students that reach higher education nowadays are familiar with CT and programming. This paper presents the development of a serious game to support the learning of basic computer programming. It is a blocks-based environment including also resources that allow the teacher to follow the student’s progress and customize in-game tasks. Four cycles of experiments were conducted, improving both the game and how it was used. Based on the results of these experiences, the key contribution of this paper is a set of fourteen findings and recommendations to the creation and use of a game-based approach to support introductory computer programming learning for novices."
ANGGORO2025500158,Effect of game-based learning on students’ mathematics high order thinking skills: A meta-analysis,"Educational research trends demonstrate a growing interest in understanding the impact of games on mathematics achievement. However, only a limited number of studies have synthesized previous quantitative studies to investigate how game-based learning (GBL) influences the enhancement of students' high-order thinking skills (HOTS) in mathematics. To address this gap, this meta-analysis study aims to investigate the effectiveness of GBL on students' mathematics HOTS. The study analyzed 40 effect sizes from 13 empirical studies published from 2010 to 2024, gathered from electronic databases such as Scopus, Eric, and Pro-Quest. R software was employed for analyzing effect sizes, detecting publication bias, and conducting subgroup analyses. Using the k-means algorithm, two studies identified as outliers were excluded. After removing these outliers, the findings revealed a positive effect of GBL on students' mathematics HOTS, with an overall effect falling within the small category (g=.134, p<.001). Additionally, moderator variables, including educational level, measured thinking skills, continent, control treatment, and intervention duration, significantly influenced the improvement of HOTS using GBL, while the sample size factor showed no significant impact. All findings, limitations, and implications are discussed in this article.
Resumen
Las tendencias de investigación educativa muestran un creciente interés en comprender el impacto de los juegos en el logro en matemáticas. Sin embargo, solo un número limitado de estudios ha sintetizado investigaciones cuantitativas previas para investigar cómo el aprendizaje basado en juegos (ABJ) influye en la mejora de las habilidades de pensamiento de alto nivel (HOTS) de los estudiantes en matemáticas. Para abordar esta brecha, se ha realizado un estudio de metaanálisis con el objetivo de investigar la efectividad del ABJ en las HOTS matemáticas de los estudiantes. El estudio ha analizado 40 tamaños de efecto de 13 estudios empíricos publicados desde 2010 hasta 2024, recopilados de bases de datos electrónicas como Scopus, Eric y Pro-Quest. Se ha empleado el software R para analizar los tamaños de efecto, detectar sesgo de publicación y realizar análisis de subgrupos. Utilizando el algoritmo k-means, se han excluido dos estudios identificados como valores atípicos. Después de eliminar estos valores atípicos, los hallazgos han revelado un efecto positivo del ABJ en las HOTS matemáticas de los estudiantes, con un efecto general situado dentro de la categoría pequeña (g=.134, p<.001). Además, se ha encontrado que variables moderadoras, incluido el nivel educativo, las habilidades de pensamiento medidas, el continente, el tratamiento de control y la duración de la intervención, han influido significativamente en la mejora de las HOTS mediante el ABJ; mientras que el factor de tamaño de la muestra no ha mostrado un impacto significativo. Se han discutido todos los hallazgos, limitaciones e implicaciones en este artículo."
AGUAYO2023e19205,Ethical enactivism for smart and inclusive STEAM learning design,"Current global challenges of the 21st century promote STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) education and digitalization as a means for humans to be the central actors in the construction of a sustainable society that favors a sense of worth and global wellbeing. In this scenario, new educational technology tools and immersive learning affordances (possibilities), offer unprecedented potential for the design of smart and dynamic learning systems and contexts that can enhance learning processes across varied audiences and educational settings. However, current STEAM education practice lacks attention to equipping all citizens with the necessary skills to use digital technologies in an ethical, critical and creative way. This gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. On the other hand, in its formulation STEAM as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during STEAM education design. Following an apparent need to explore ethical and inclusive design in STEAM education, and inspired in the 4E cognition framework, ethical enactivism and embodied and ecosomaesthetics experience design, here we propose a theoretical framework grounded on systems thinking for the design of smart and dynamic STEAM learning systems and settings. The framework is aimed at STEAM educational psychologists, educational technologists, learning designers and educational practitioners who wish to address the global challenges of 21st century education by means of creative, innovative and inclusive education design."
ANDERSEN2024100697,Infrastructuring digital literacy in K-12 education: A national case study,"While much CCI research has dealt with the educational challenge of providing children with knowledge and skills for a digital society, little work has dealt with the strategic challenge of developing and implementing a digital literacy subject in K-12 education. In this paper, we explore how to develop, implement, and sustain a national program on technology comprehension by analyzing the newly established Danish knowledge center for digital technology comprehension. We draw on the concept of infrastructuring to shed light on how to create and sustain the social, material, political and organizational structures that form the basis for introducing the new national initiative. Based on our case, we distill seven propositions that describe more generally how to work strategically with this challenge."
CSERNOCH2025100676,Lean digital education to resolve the paradox of the illusion of digital prosperity,"Digital education, including digitally supported education, is loaded with biases. Most participants are blinded by the abundance of digital devices and misled by the hardware and software providers who try to convince and force education systems to keep track of untraceable developments. However, recent studies have revealed that the productivity of the participants and the sustainability of their digital artifacts generate a huge but silent waste, both in terms of human and machine resources. This contradiction generates a paradox in which the illusion of digital prosperity does not allow us to clearly see the ineffectiveness of digital processes and artifacts and the losses piling up. Our research revealed that the methodology of Lean Thinking allows us to find the root causes of the problems and the revolutionary changes which must be applied to eliminate the waste generated by the participants in the digital era. It was also found that the adaptation of the lean philosophy, proven effective in production, services, and administration, can be a solution in resolving the paradox of digital education, which leads us to Lean Digital Education (LDE). Within this framework – instead of the widely accepted tool-centered ideas – we offer a human-centered, long-term thinking philosophy focusing on respect for participants, on their development, tasks, and problems, while at the same time eliminating and reducing waste. The present paper details the strength of this innovative approach which is based on (1) a solid theoretical background (2) a reliable measuring system for calculating the waste of digital activities and artifacts, (3) approaches proven to be effective and efficient in end-user data management, and (4) examples of the learning-teaching materials which support the philosophy adapted."
LISANA2025100896,Playing to learn: Game-based approach to financial literacy for generation Z,"This quantitative study assessed the effectiveness of game-based learning in improving financial literacy among Generation Z. Conducted with 32 urban participants, the study involved the use of a board game and a mobile application, designed with input from financial literacy experts. Participants underwent a pretest to gauge their initial financial knowledge, engaged with the game, and completed a posttest to measure learning outcomes. Statistical analysis, including paired sample t-tests, compared pretest and posttest scores, revealing a significant enhancement in financial literacy post-gameplay. Furthermore, a questionnaire evaluated user satisfaction regarding the game, assessing metrics like enjoyment, ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Results demonstrated not only an improvement in financial knowledge but also high satisfaction among users, indicating that game-based learning can be a valuable tool for teaching financial concepts to Generation Z. These findings contribute to the understanding of game-based learning’s potential in financial education and provide insights for educators and parents. However, the study’s limitations suggest areas for future research to explore and refine the use of educational games in financial literacy."
HENRIQUE2023100546,Who creates our computational worlds? A review of Critically Conscious Computing: Methods for secondary education,"Despite growing attention to the social and ethical dimensions of Computer Science (CS), few practical resources exist to teach and learn CS through the lens of social responsibility. In Critically Conscious Computing, Ko and colleagues provide a comprehensive overview of foundational computing concepts with a sharp and needed critical perspective. In this review, we attend not only to the content of the book, but also to its format as a free, online, “living” text. The book is commendable for its tight integration of technical and socio-critical aspects of computing, approachable conversational style, and collection of flexible and practical resources for teachers. It would benefit from refinement of the integration chapters and a more explicit model for how educators themselves can approach new or different CS concepts through a critical frame. Overall, we strongly recommend this book for CS Educators at all levels for its balance of depth and practicality."
MOODLEY2022e1855,Ethics and governance challenges related to genomic data sharing in southern Africa: the case of SARS-CoV-2,"Summary
Data sharing in research is fraught with controversy. Academic success is premised on competitive advantage, with research teams protecting their research findings until publication. Research funders, by contrast, often require data sharing. Beyond traditional research and funding requirements, surveillance data have become contentious. Public health emergencies involving pathogens require intense genomic surveillance efforts and call for the rapid sharing of data on the basis of public interest. Under these circumstances, timely sharing of data becomes a matter of scientific integrity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the transformative potential of genomic pathogen data sharing became obvious and advanced the debate on data sharing. However, when the genomic sequencing data of the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was shared and announced by scientists in southern Africa, various challenges arose, including travel bans. The scientific, economic, and moral impact was catastrophic. Yet, travel restrictions failed to mitigate the spread of the variant already present in countries outside Africa. Public perceptions of the negative effect of data sharing are detrimental to the willingness of research participants to consent to sharing data in postpandemic research and future pandemics. Global health governance organisations have an important role in developing guidance on responsible sharing of genomic pathogen data in public health emergencies."
JUNG2023198,Design-based education in STEM: for learners of the 21st century,"This article aims to conceptualize design-based education (DBE) in STEM educational settings and provide examples of current DBE practices followed by discussing the gaps of current DBE. We define DBE as educational theory and practice that integrate and transform design processes and design thinking into learning experiences. DBE is well-aligned with the 21st century STEM education because it can enhance learner-centered pedagogy, learners' critical thinking, collaboration, interest-driven learning, and integrative STEM learning. More attention to concrete strategies for the integrative STEM education in DBE and systems of preparing educators for DBE is needed for better learning experiences."
STOLPE2024100159,Artificial intelligence literacy for technology education,"The interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in education has erupted during the last few years, primarily due to technological advances in AI. It is therefore argued that students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI. This study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating AI literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical technical understanding. The results show that AI literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI). Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for technology education is suggested."
LANDAU2024101463,Young children’s copying of block constructions: Significant constraints in a highly complex task,"Block construction is ubiquitous in early development, yet is surprisingly complex, involving step-by-step sequenced actions to create specific structures. Here, we use novel analytic methods to characterize these action sequences in detail, including which individual parts of the structure (‘states’) are built and how these structures are combined, creating a fully specified build path towards the final structure. We find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. The individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths. Our approach serves as a lens into the cognitive processes underlying block building and suggests that children’s building is guided by significant cognitive constraints consistent with “computational thinking”."
CROOCK2025102650,Uncharted territory: the role of mitochondrial DNA variation in macrophage-mediated host susceptibility to tuberculosis,"Mitochondria form an integral, yet frequently underappreciated, part of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), particularly within macrophages. Despite growing recognition for their role in infection and immunity, studies investigating how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation influences host susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) are limited. Notably, there are no studies in African-based populations, although Africans possess unparalleled human genetic diversity, including the earliest diverged mitochondrial haplogroups, and a high TB burden. This underrepresentation limits the discovery of novel ancestry-specific genetic loci associated with TB. In this review article, we describe the unique characteristics of mtDNA, highlight key mitochondrial functions relevant to macrophage responses during M.tb infection, and summarise published studies that investigate the role of host mtDNA variation in TB susceptibility. We further advocate for the inclusion of African populations in future studies to identify novel TB susceptibility genetic risk loci and expand the current knowledgebase on host TB susceptibility."
MAASDORP2025102610,Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria identified by line probe assays in respiratory and non-respiratory samples in South Africa between 2015 and 2019,"In recent years, a rise in non-tuberculosis mycobacteria pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) has been reported in several countries. However, data for high-burden tuberculosis settings, including South Africa, is currently limited. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of routine diagnostic data obtained from one diagnostic laboratory in South Africa between 2015 and 2019. During this period, samples from 275 individuals with suspected mycobacterial infection were tested using the GenoType Mycobacterium CM (Common mycobacteria) or AS (Additional species) line probe assay (LPA) (Brucker-Hain Life science, Nehren, Germany), yielding an NTM-positive result for 163 of these individuals. Interestingly, the positivity rate in respiratory samples declined from 93 % in 2015 to 79 % in 2019. Just over half of the positive samples were of respiratory origin, and the most common species identified in respiratory samples was Mycobacterium intracellulare/Mycobacteium avium complex (28.9 %), followed by M. avium (17.4 %). Where the mycobacterial species was not identified by the LPA, a higher proportion of the subsequent cultures were negative, suggestive of colonisation rather than infection. More than half of patients with a positive NTM-LPA were HIV positive (55.9 %), and this association declined slightly during the study period (62.5 %–50 %)."
EGBERT2021104173,“It's a chance to make mistakes”: Processes and outcomes of coding in 2nd grade classrooms,"Several gaps exist in the literature on coding. First, little exploration has focused on early elementary school students. In addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. Further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. Moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. Therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. In this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. Multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. Conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms."
ARBELAEZOSSA2023102458,A smarter perspective: Learning with and from AI-cases,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has only partially (or not at all) been integrated into medical education, leading to growing concerns regarding how to train healthcare practitioners to handle the changes brought about by the introduction of AI. Programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using AI or other future technology. However, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. Technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients."
YANG2025104836,Teacher learning and preschoolers’ STEM habits of mind: Evidence from two studies,"This paper explores the influence of teacher learning on young children's STEM habits of mind through two studies involving Chinese preschools. Study 1 (141 teachers, 3214 students) demonstrates a significant impact of teacher attributes, particularly STEM teaching self-efficacy, on preschoolers' STEM habits of mind. Study 2 (77 teachers, 1514 students) reveals significant differences in child performance across intervention groups. Interventions incorporating Curriculum-Based Professional Learning (CBPL) principles positively affect preschoolers' STEM habits of mind. These findings highlight the importance of teacher attributes and targeted CBPL interventions for fostering STEM habits of mind in preschoolers, with implications for educational practices and policies."
SAMUELSSON2023100173,A shape of play to come: Exploring children's play and imaginaries with robots and AI,"We are rapidly moving into an era where AI and robots are part of everyday interactions in society and education, and there are immense discussions today about current and future technologies. Still, children are often not included in this discussion, while there is much to learn from current uses and children's understandings of AI and robotics. The study is based on a seven-month ethnographical work that details the implementation of a robot in two preschool groups of children aged 1–2 and 3–5 (n = 38). The study descriptively combines a framework for children's play analysis with explorative qualitative child interviews (n = 6) with the 3-5-year-olds to examine how children play with the robot and their thinking about a future with robots and AI. The results show how children's play with robots spans all of Hughes's (2011) sixteen play types and integrates robots into play in ways specific to child-robot interaction. The interviews indicate that children have well-formed knowledge about the current uses of robots and AI and elaborate imaginaries about a future with them, including critical boundaries toward robots and AI agents. The evidence shows emerging ways children relate to these. The potential of including children's actions and voices in the ongoing societal and educational debates on AI is discussed."
WEINTROP2025100707,Emerging computational and digital literacies in K-12 education,"The rise of new technologies, platforms, and computational tools is having a significant and meaningful impact on the ways youth experience and interact with the world. To prepare youth to thrive in these new computational and technological spaces, new skills, concepts, and practices need to be integrated into learners' K-12 experiences. This special issued asked the IJCCI community: What are the critical emerging computational and digital literacies that youth are, or will be, interacting with in the coming years? And, What is the role of K-12 education in preparing youth to engage with and excel in a world where these literacies are needed? The answers to these questions provided by the community constitute this special issue. In doing so, it provides a snapshot of what we currently view as the critical emerging computational and digital literacies and the roles they can and should play in K-12 education."
SCHERER2020106349,A meta-analysis of teaching and learning computer programming: Effective instructional approaches and conditions,"This meta-analysis maps the evidence on the effectiveness of instructional approaches and conditions for learning computer programming under three study conditions: (a) Studies focusing on the effectiveness of programming interventions per se, (b) studies focusing on the effectiveness of visualization and physicality, and (c) studies focusing on the effectiveness of dominant instructional approaches. Utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (Hedges’ g‾ = 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.21]), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g‾ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.29, 0.58]) and physicality interventions (g‾ = 0.72, 95% CI [0.23, 1.21]), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (g‾s = 0.49–1.02). Moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditions—however, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through Scratch were especially effective. Our meta-analysis synthesizes the existing research evidence on the effectiveness of computer programming instruction and, ultimately, provides references with which the effects of future studies could be compared."
SU2022100072,Artificial Intelligence (AI) in early childhood education: Curriculum design and future directions,"With the rapid technological development of society brought on by Artificial Intelligence (AI), the demand for AI-literate workers will increase in the future. It is critical to develop the next generation's AI competencies and educate them about how to work with and use AI. Previous studies on AI were predominantly focused on secondary and university education; however, research on the Artificial Intelligence curriculum in early childhood education is scarce. Due to the lack of conformity on the standardisation of AI curriculum for early childhood education, this study examines the AI curriculum for kindergarten children using the framework which consists of four key components, including (1) aims, goals, objectives, or declarations of outcome, (2) subject matter, domains, or content, (3) methods or procedure, (4) evaluation and assessment. We recommend that AI literacy be achieved by three competencies: AI Knowledge, AI Skill, and AI Attitude. The employment of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was proven to be helpful in assisting young children in grasping AI principles. We also discovered which teaching methods had the most greatest influence on students' learning. We recommend problem-based learning for future AI education based on the findings."
QUESTATORTEROLO2025102594,A case of teaching in multigrade classrooms in Uruguay: Challenges and opportunities for learning and teaching in inclusive environments,"This study aimed to investigate the pedagogical practices and perceptions of an experienced teacher in the context of multigrade preschool and primary education classrooms in Uruguay. The focus was on understanding how these practices contribute to inclusive education and promote equity. To achieve this objective, a qualitative case study methodology was employed, collecting data through three in-depth interviews with the teacher and a thorough analysis of twelve pedagogical documents, which were examined using thematic content analysis. The results reveal the inclusive teaching strategies implemented by the teacher, the curricular adaptations applied in the classroom, and the management practices developed in response to various emerging situations. Although based on a single case, these findings suggest that the multigrade classroom modality presents both challenges and opportunities for achieving quality teaching and meaningful learning for students through authentic inclusion."
PILLAY2024113656,Performance of Softcup® menstrual cup and vulvovaginal swab samples for detection and quantification of genital cytokines,"Cytokines are important mediators of immunity in the female genital tract, and their levels may be associated with various reproductive health outcomes. However, the measurement of cytokines and chemokines in vaginal fluid samples may be influenced by a variety of factors, each with the potential to affect the sensitivity and accuracy of the assay, including the interpretation and comparison of data. We measured and compared cytokine milieu in samples collected via Softcup® menstrual cup versus vulvovaginal swabs. One hundred and eighty vulvovaginal swabs from CAPRISA 088 and 42 Softcup supernatants from CAPRISA 016 cohorts of pregnant women were used to measure the concentrations of 28 cytokines through multiplexing. Cytokines measured in this study were detectable in each of the methods however, SoftCup supernatants showed consistently, higher detectability, expression ratios, and mean concentration of cytokines than vulvovaginal swabs. While mean concentrations differed, the majority of cytokines correlated between SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swabs. Additionally, there were no significant differences in a number of participants between the two sampling methods for the classification of genital inflammation. Our findings suggest that SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swab samples are suitable for the collection of genital specimens to study biological markers of genital inflammatory response. However, the Softcup menstrual cup performs better for the detection and quantification of soluble biomarkers that are found in low concentrations in cervicovaginal fluid."
MACHINMASTROMATTEO2025376,Literacy of the Future,"This entry summarizes the development of the literacy concepts most commonly associated with LIS, namely information literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy, which frame a synthesis of the future perspectives of these and other literacies that have been proposed in the literature.11An alphabetical and non-exhaustive list could include: academic literacy, artificial intelligence or algorithmic literacy, civic literacy, context literacy, data literacy, emotional literacy, financial literacy, focus literacy, futures literacies, game literacy, graphic literacy, health literacy, literacy education, legal literacy, media literacy, multiliteracies, new literacies, new media literacies, navigation literacy, numerical literacy, participatory/participation literacy, personal literacy, psycho-literacy, scientific literacy, search engine literacy, skepticism literacy, statistical literacy, transliteracy, and visual literacy or visuacy. Note: not all of these are covered in this entry for space limitations. These future perspectives are organized in nine sections: the educational implications of literacy, information literacy, digital literacy, literacy education, multiliteracies and holistic perspectives, media literacy, futures literacy, algorithmic literacy and artificial intelligence implications, and other literacies. The purpose of this entry is to offer a brief overview and commentary on the types of literacies that we need to be aware of and competent in for the near future. As these future trends are derived from the specialized literature, they include some already occurring considerations. However, they might become more salient topics in the upcoming years, and they might entail many different implications for the future of LIS professionals, libraries, and even for education in general."
KOCAK2021100967,The mediating role of critical thinking and cooperativity in the 21st century skills of higher education students,"This study investigates whether cooperativity and critical thinking mediate the relationship between other 21st century skills (algorithmic thinking, creativity, digital literacy, and effective communication) and problem-solving. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis was used to determine the mediating relationship between 21st century skills. The study participants were 714 undergraduate students from various regions of Turkey selected through purposive sampling and who participated on a voluntary basis. Computational thinking, effective communication, and digital literacy scales were used and a significant correlation was found between all the 21st century skills. A series of structural equation models were tested. The final model suggests that, in line with predictions, critical thinking mediates the relationship between the 21st century skills of cooperativity, digital literacy, creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem solving. However, somewhat different from predictions is the finding that communication skills directly predict problem solving without further mediation. Thus, overall, the findings indicate that critical thinking has a crucial mediating role between other 21st century skills and problem solving."
AKANDA2025112329,Understanding comment practices in Scratch: A study of comments in a block-based visual programming language,"Comments are vital for software documentation. They provide necessary insights and assist developers in understanding and maintaining the software. Due to their importance, comments have been extensively studied, and much has been learned about them. These existing studies have predominantly focused on text-based languages. Conversely, block-based visual programming languages, particularly Scratch, are becoming increasingly popular. Some studies regarding comments related to the Scratch online community focus on topics such as fostering online community and engagement, sentiment analysis, etc. However, they overlook the visual aspects and the qualitative analysis of comments within code in Scratch projects. This is a meaningful limitation, and this research project studies comments and their pattern in Scratch projects from both textual and visual perspectives. We examined comments collected from different Scratch projects. Each comment was manually annotated based on textual and visual attributes, producing a taxonomy model of comments for a visual programming language. The classification results were analyzed to understand better the practice of commenting in Scratch. Our result revealed that Scratch projects produced noisier(i.e., less understandable) comments than text-based programming languages like Java. In addition, the study also revealed several limitations and shortcomings that could be addressed to improve the commenting experience in Scratch."
RAPTI2024104968,"“Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, Creativity in kindergarten with Educational Robotics”: A scoping review (2012–2023)","Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, and Creativity are regarded as key skills for today's learners. Interest in robotics usage to develop such competencies in educational settings arises but there hasn't been so far mapping of the research conducted in this field. Thus, we present a scoping review of 59 articles published from 2012 to 2023 in 4 Databases and 2 Registers examining kindergarteners' skills through Educational Robotics. Our goal was to map which skills are commonly examined in kindergarten and under which terminology as well as to investigate the studies' features, the types of robotics, and the assessment tools utilized. Our findings depict that several skills are evaluated using different terms. Critical thinking is examined most frequently, creativity the least, and communication is integrated into collaboration and the opposite. Most of the researchers used the mixed method focusing on qualitative tools, examining quite a small sample size, and conducting the intervention for a short time. Also: BeeBot, Lego robotics kits (WeDo, Mindstorms), and social, humanoid robots are often used. Additionally, the evaluation tools used in the reviewed papers are presented and categorized into groups. This scoping demonstrates that robotics might affect positively the children's cognitive skills and creativity but may not facilitate their interactions so much regarding emotional expressions. Moreover, a gap in quantitative research on kindergarteners' skills development via Educational Robotics is spotted. Finally, this scoping review suggests: creating clear terms for skills, developing robotics tailored to kindergarten age, forming full robotics activities, and designing modular evaluation tools for young learners' capacities."
PALIOURA2025105186,“Storytelling and educational robotics: A scoping review (2004–2024)”,"Storytelling has been used for years in educational practice and Educational Robotics is a rapidly growing field worldwide. Accordingly, researchers have attempted to combine Storytelling and Robotics in education. However, no systematic record exists on this combination. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review of 82 papers out of 5272 articles published in 5 Databases in the last 20 years to map the conducted research so far. In detail: the educational levels and the school subjects in which storytelling and educational robotics are applied, the types of robots used, the duration, the sample size, participants' age and the skills that students may develop through this combination. Additionally, we analyzed, grouped, and presented the tools used for measuring the potential effects of storytelling and educational robotics. Finally, the students' role in the activities was sought. Based on our findings, most interventions mainly addressed preschool and primary school students, the robots used the most are humanoid, most interventions did not exceed 6 h, and the number of participants was less than 20 students. Besides, most interventions tried to develop students’ skills (communication, creativity, collaboration) and attitudes (engagement, motivation, participation) with qualitative tools borrowed from other domains (e.g. psychology, healthcare). This scoping demonstrates a gap in the use of storytelling and educational robotics in secondary and university education and subjects like history, geography, etc. Finally, this combination seems to have the potential to enhance the educational process, but more research is needed to shed light on all the aspects of the combination."

Future plans include expanding the tool to incorporate more modules, allowing customization by teachers, and conducting broader evaluations in different educational environments."
NIXON2024100992,Using machine learning to predict investors’ switching behaviour,"Individual investors’ decisions to switch investments very often lead to significantly lower investment returns so having an effective predictive model of these switches would be of value to clients, advisors and investment managers. A random forest algorithm was applied to a new dataset of over 20 million observations relating to 95,685 clients on Momentum Investments’ platform between 2018 and 2024. It identified a combination of investor characteristics (number of holdings, past switching behaviour, total assets) and external features (past returns, macroeconomic variables) as the key features of investor switch behaviour. This model exceeds commercially accepted standards in respect of the AUC and Gini metrics showcasing the model’s strength in its ranking capability. It can thus provide a useful basis for client segmentation and engagement by financial advisors."
KHANMOHAMMADI2024104660,Comparative multi-objective optimization using neural networks for ejector refrigeration systems with LiBr and LiCl working agents,"Education's evolution in the context of energy systems is essential for addressing sustainable energy challenges and developing a workforce equipped for future innovations, emphasizing both formal curricula and informal lifelong learning through successful energy case studies. As the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. Exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar-powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). Based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. The studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. The present work's main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. Energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two-objective optimization were extracted. Parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed system's performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. In addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. To find the best values of decision variables, multi-objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. The results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 $/h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 $/h). The outcomes of this work can play a critical role for higher education institutions in advancing innovative solutions to pressing energy challenges. Lifelong learning, at the heart of educational innovation, can benefit from the integration of sustainable energy systems as a core component of informal education through the optimization of ejector refrigeration systems."

ARIYA2025101387,"Digital literacy through gaming: A comparative study of knowledge acquisition, social presence, and emotional reactions in digital and non-digital board games","The trend of educational board games is experiencing significant growth, with notable integration of technology; however, many educators continue to use both digital and physical board games. Digital board games offer convenience, accessibility, and enhanced interactivity through features like animations, sound effects, and automated rule enforcement. In contrast, physical board games emphasize tactile engagement and face-to-face social presence, fostering a stronger sense of connection among players. This study investigates the comparative impacts of digital and non-digital board games on knowledge acquisition, social presence, and emotional reactions among higher education students. Employing a quasi-experimental design, 82 students enrolled in an Information Literacy course were divided into two groups: one using digital board games and the other using non-digital board games. Pre- and post-tests measured knowledge acquisition, while the Social Presence in Gaming Questionnaire (SPGQ) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) assessed social and emotional impacts. Results indicate that both digital and non-digital games significantly enhance knowledge acquisition, with no substantial differences between the two formats. However, digital board games showed higher engagement levels, suggesting a greater potential for promoting active participation. Emotional responses were similar across both groups, with no significant differences in positive or negative affect. These findings underscore the educational value of both game formats and highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate type based on specific educational objectives."
ARASTOOPOURIRGENS2024100699,User experience testing and co-designing a digital game for broadening participation in computing with and for elementary school children,"Broadening participation in computing is more than providing access to computing for students; it requires reimagining and transforming teaching and learning to be more inclusive and culturally sustaining and it begins with elementary school children. In this study, we report on the fourth cycle of a participatory design-based research project in which researchers and children co-design culturally responsive-sustaining computational learning environments. We conducted user experience testing and co-design sessions with seven children on one level of a game-based learning environment in development. We model children's discourse through Epistemic Network Analysis models to investigate their feedback on character design, game narratives, and introductory activities. Our findings reveal 1) children's positive response to characters with counternarratives and visible intersectional identities in computing, 2) positive and negative experiences and feedback from children on game activities and narratives, and 3) suggestions for improvement."
HAPPE2025112240,Authentic interdisciplinary online courses for alternative pathways into computer science,"The field of computer science (CS) is facing a crucial challenge in broadening participation and embracing diversity, especially among underrepresented gender groups. The presented interdisciplinary educational program is an efficient response to this challenge, designed to catalyze diversity in CS through engagement with complex, interest-driven problems. This paper outlines the program’s structure, elucidates the pedagogical underpinnings, and reflects on the emergent challenges and opportunities. We delve into how the fusion of CS with other academic disciplines can allure a more varied demographic, emphasizing the engagement of female high school students—a demographic pivotally positioned yet significantly untapped in CS. Through a systematic survey analysis, we measure the program’s efficacy in increasing interest in CS and in cultivating an appreciation for its application in addressing real-world, cross-disciplinary challenges. Our findings affirm the program’s success in bridging the engagement gap by leveraging students’ intrinsic interests, thus charting alternative pathways into the CS field. These insights underscore the critical role of interdisciplinary approaches, establishing a new standard for transformative CS educational methods."

YILMAZ2023100005,Augmented intelligence in programming learning: Examining student views on the use of ChatGPT for programming learning,"With the diversification of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the interest in their use in every segment and field of society in recent years has been increasing rapidly. One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons."
YANG2025105265,Harmony in diversity: Digital literacy research in a multidisciplinary landscape,"The advent of the digital era has significantly heightened interest in digital literacy across multidisciplinary backgrounds and has endowed these fields with interdisciplinary and integrative characteristics. In this study, we employed VOSviewer and Bibliometrix for bibliometric and descriptive analyses of digital literacy, and we analyzed 3005 records from the Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index. We constructed keyword co-occurrence time networks across five distinct research areas and supplemented them with keyword co-occurrence frequencies to examine similarities and differences between research themes from diverse disciplinary perspectives. The findings of this study indicate that although various fields recognize the significance of digital literacy, different fields prioritize different aspects. As the main field of research, Education & Educational Research focus primarily on the pedagogical practices of cultivating digital literacy, whereas Communication emphasizes the cultivation of digital literacy to address challenges in information dissemination. Information Science & Library Science typically view libraries as central to digital literacy. Moreover, Computer Science research emphasizes the leveraging of technology, whereas Psychology explores the connection between digital literacy and cognitive processes. Analyzing the differences between different disciplines and drawing new ideas from them is of great significance for Education & Educational Research regarding how to deepen digital literacy education content, construct digital literacy education contexts, integrate digital literacy education resources, narrow the digital divide, and promote educational equity in the future."
HOZ2024e40032,Educational robotics for science and mathematics teaching: Analysis of pre-service teachers' perceptions and self-confidence,"Educational Robotics has had an important impact in recent years as it offers a number of advantages for students. The inclusion of robotics in any educational stage requires teachers with adequate predisposition and training, making it necessary to know the opinions of pre-service teachers. The aim of our study is to analyze the perceptions and self-confidence of 109 pre-service primary education teachers before and after an intervention based on educational robotics and challenge-based learning to teach scientific and mathematical content, in their third academic year. A quasi-experimental design was used involving pretest and posttest, using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon U tests. The results showed a significant improvement in the overall mean self-confidence. In addition, the intervention led to a more positive perception of the benefits and possibilities of robotics for teaching of scientific and mathematical content, although it also increased the difficulties of implementation due to the lack of training in this digital resource. It is concluded that interventions are required based on educational robotics that allow pre-service teachers to gain the necessary self-confidence and perception to facilitate its introduction for the teaching of scientific and mathematical content."
OU2023e15530,Investigation and analysis of the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools,"With the rapid development of the era of artificial intelligence, the application ability of programming is also highlighted. As one of the necessary abilities of social talents in the future, primary and secondary schools pay more and more attention to this, and programming education is also in full swing. Therefore, based on previous studies, this paper further clarifies the current situation when the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools is ambiguous. This paper is aimed at a wide range of primary and secondary school teachers. With 1500 teachers who participated in the online training class for programming teachers as the object in Chinese primary, middle and high school stages, mainly from the three levels of schools, teachers, and students. The questionnaire with good reliability and validity test was used as the research method, the survey data were statistically described and analyzed, and differences were analyzed using Microsoft Excel2019, SPSS26.0 and so on, it investigates and analyzes the current situation of programming education in primary and secondary schools. Results indicate that the overall quality of programming education offerings in elementary and secondary schools is subpar, and the construction of programming education curriculum in schools requires improvement. Nevertheless, schools prioritize improving students' comprehensive abilities, and teachers hold a positive attitude towards programming education and teaching. Although students demonstrate a strong interest in learning, their foundation is weak, resulting in poor learning outcomes. Consequently, the author provides specific recommendations regarding programming education's working mechanism, curriculum standard system, teacher training, and educational resources sharing to better develop programming education in primary and secondary schools."
SAMSUNDER2023105498,Performance of rapid antigen tests in identifying Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 infections in South Africa,"Background
Concerns around accuracy and performance of rapid antigen tests continue to be raised with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Objective
To evaluate the performance of two widely used SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests during BA.4/BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 wave in South Africa (May – June 2022).
Study design
A prospective field evaluation compared the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test from Hangzhou AllTest Biotech (nasal swab) and the Standard Q COVID-19 Rapid Antigen test from SD Biosensor (nasopharyngeal swab) to the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (nasopharyngeal swab) on samples collected from 540 study participants.
Results
Overall 28.52% (154/540) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive with median cycle number value of 12.30 (IQR 9.30–19.40). Out of the 99 successfully sequenced SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, 18 were classified as BA.4 and 56 were classified as BA.5. The overall sensitivities of the AllTest SARS-CoV-2 Ag test and Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test were 73.38% (95% CI 65.89–79.73) and 74.03% (95% CI 66.58–80.31) and their specificities were 97.41% (95% CI 95.30–98.59) and 99.22% (95% CI 97.74–99.74) respectively. Sensitivity was >90% when the cycle number value was <20. The sensitivity of both rapid tests was >90% in samples infected with Omicron sub-lineage BA.4 and BA.5.
Conclusion
Accuracy of tested rapid antigen tests that target the nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 protein, were not adversely affected by BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants."
MASON2020103898,Development and analysis of the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey,"There is an increasing emphasis on teaching young learners to code; yet, there are few tools designed to measure the effect of learning to code on children. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess changes in young learners' attitudes toward coding: the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS). We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors. We discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners’ attitudes toward coding over time."

The findings underscore the potential of drones to ignite passion for STEM subjects among secondary students, achieved through interdisciplinary, hands-on applications that foster problem-solving and design competencies."
VIDENOVIK2022,Migration of an Escape Room–Style Educational Game to an Online Environment: Design Thinking Methodology,"Background
The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has led to a sudden change in education, closing schools and shifting to online teaching, which has become an enormous challenge for teachers and students. Implementing adequate online pedagogical approaches and integrating different digital tools in the teaching process have become a priority in educational systems. Finding a way to keep students' interest and persistence in learning is an important issue that online education is facing. One possible way to establish engaging and interactive learning environments, using the energy and enthusiasm of students for educational purposes, is the use of game-based learning activities and gamification of different parts of the educational process.
Objective
This paper presents a use case of migrating an escape room–style educational game to an online environment by using the design thinking methodology. We wanted to show that the design thinking methodology is useful to create engaging and motivating online games that provide educational value.
Methods
Starting from students’ perspective, we created a simple digital escape room–style game where students got an opportunity to self-assess their knowledge in computer science at their own pace. Students tested this prototype game, and their opinions about the game were collected through an online survey. The test's goal was to evaluate the students' perceptions about the implemented digital escape room–style educational game and gather information about whether it could achieve students' engagement in learning computer science during online teaching.
Results
In total, 117 students from sixth and seventh grades completed the survey regarding the achieved student engagement. Despite the differences in students’ answers about game complexity and puzzle difficulty, most students liked the activity (mean 4.75, SD 0.67, on a scale from 1 to 5). They enjoyed the game, and they would like to participate in this kind of activity again (mean 4.74, SD 0.68). All (n=117, 100%) students found the digital escape room–style educational game interesting for playing and learning.
Conclusions
The results confirmed that digital escape room–style games could be used as an educational tool to engage students in the learning process and achieve learning outcomes. Furthermore, the design thinking methodology proved to be a useful tool in the process of adding novel educational value to the digital escape room–style game."
LOCKWOOD2020100783,A case for combinatorics: A research commentary,"In this commentary, we make a case for the explicit inclusion of combinatorial topics in mathematics curricula, where it is currently essentially absent. We suggest ways in which researchers might inform the field’s understanding of combinatorics and its potential role in curricula. We reflect on five decades of research that has been conducted since a call by Kapur (1970) for a greater focus on combinatorics in mathematics education. Specifically, we discuss the following five assertions: 1) Combinatorics is accessible, 2) Combinatorics problems provide opportunities for rich mathematical thinking, 3) Combinatorics fosters desirable mathematical practices, 4) Combinatorics can contribute positively to issues of equity in mathematics education, and 5) Combinatorics is a natural domain in which to examine and develop computational thinking and activity. Ultimately, we make a case for the valuable and unique ways in which combinatorics might effectively be leveraged within K-16 curricula."
MATTHEWS2021100278,Reconceptualising feedback: Designing educational tangible technologies to be a creative material,"This paper investigates how children who are engaged in a creative project with tangible technology kits make sense of the system feedback the technology provides. A micro-analytic video study was conducted of primary school children designing their own technologies using existing educational microcontrollers. Our investigation reveals that the roles feedback plays in children’s interactions cannot easily be assimilated within the existing approaches to understand feedback that have been articulated in HCI literature. Our qualitative analysis shows how children do not make sense of feedback as semantic communication from the system, but make sense of it with respect to its embeddedness in a sequence of activities they are performing with the system and each other. The principal contribution to emerge from our study is a conception of feedback as a process, rather than as a semantic communicative event, nor a direct coupling of action and system response. Our discussion identifies how feedback participates in the institutional agendas of classrooms (e.g. discovery, computational thinking), and draws out initial implications for the design of feedback in educational tangible technologies, identifying possibilities for how feedback might be redesigned to better promote children’s diagnostic practices with open-ended technology kits."
MANCHES2020105859,Identifying embodied metaphors for computing education,"Computing education is increasing in global importance, with calls for greater understanding of conceptual development that can inform pedagogy. Here, we report a study investigating elementary computing concepts through the lens of Embodied Cognition. Sixteen students (9 female) studying university-level computing were asked to explain their understanding of computing concepts (without materials) in individually video-recorded sessions. We analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. In total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 × 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. Our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) Computing Constructs as Physical Objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) Computing Processes as Motion along a Path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences. We contrast our findings to similar research in mathematics and discuss implications for computing pedagogy – namely the role of gesture in the classroom and technologies that can exploit embodied metaphors."
MA2024100647,Design of online teaching interaction mode for vocational education based on gamified-learning,"Along with the process of building China's modern vocational education system, China's higher vocational education has made great progress. With the development of computer and Internet technology, gamified learning, as a new way of learning, combines the advantages of computer games and online learning, which not only meets the needs of people to learn anytime and anywhere, but also increases the fun of learning activities. In this paper, we developed a gamified learning software with traveler-type problems as the research content, through the interaction with the game, so that students can think in the game and learn knowledge through the game. Through the questionnaire for research and analysis, this game is good game fun and can stimulate learning interest well. In addition, this paper carries out an in-depth study of the game's help system, optimizes the algorithm for the help system, and proposes an improved genetic algorithm. The reverse learning method is adopted to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the optimal solution; then the Metropolis criterion is used to improve the crossover and mutation operators to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm; finally, the concept of realistic elite learning is introduced to further enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm is effectively improved in convergence performance and solution accuracy, which can significantly improve the response speed of the help system, effectively improve the game's fun, and improve the game's playability."
GILES20221,"A retrospective study of antivenom-associated adverse reaction and anaphylaxis at Ngwelezana Hospital, South Africa","Background
Snakebite victims are commonly seen in KwaZulu-Natal Hospitals, with only a minority of patients requiring antivenom. This study reviewed antivenom-associated adverse events at our institution, after administration of the South African Vaccine Producers (SAVP) polyvalent antivenom.
Methods
A retrospective review, over 52 months (January 2016–April 2020), of patients who received antivenom. Demographics, clinical details and clinical course following antivenom administration were analysed.
Results
Emergency department doctors treated 758 snakebites; 156 patients were admitted of which 51 (33%) received antivenom. Indications for antivenom included: neurotoxicity (24%), haemotoxicity (18%) and significant cytotoxicity (58%). Antivenom-associated adverse events occurred in 61% of patients; with 47% developing anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion. There was a higher incidence of anaphylaxis in children (57%) than in adults (40%), p = 0.55. There was no association between antivenom dose and anaphylaxis. No benefit was noted with adrenaline premedication (p = 0.64), nor with the addition of antihistamine or steroid pre-medicants to adrenaline (p = 0.61). Multivariable logistic regression identified age as a predictor for anaphylaxis, but not dose or duration of antivenom and not any particular form of premedication. Intubation was required in 29% of patients developing anaphylaxis. There were no deaths and all patients made full recovery.
Conclusion
Almost half of the patients at Ngwelezana hospital in Kwazulu-Natal receiving the SAVP polyvalent antivenom developed anaphylaxis requiring adrenaline infusion, with children at higher risk. The administration of this antivenom must only be given for valid indications, in a high-care environment by medical personnel ready to manage anaphylactic shock. The addition of antihistamine and corticosteroids to adrenaline for premedication has no added benefit."
KOUZALIS2024105312,Advanced technologies and mathematical metacognition: The present and future orientation,"The intersection of mathematical cognition, metacognition, and advanced technologies presents a frontier with profound implications for human learning and artificial intelligence. This paper traces the historical roots of these concepts from the Pythagoreans and Aristotle to modern cognitive science and explores their relevance to contemporary technological applications. We examine how the Pythagoreans' view of mathematics as fundamental to understanding the universe and Aristotle's contributions to logic and categorization have shaped our current understanding of mathematical cognition and metacognition. The paper investigates the role of Boolean logic in computational processes and its relationship to human logical reasoning, as well as the significance of Bayesian inference and fuzzy logic in modelling uncertainty in human cognition and decision-making. We also explore the emerging field of Chemical Artificial Intelligence and its potential applications. We argue for unifying mathematical metacognition with advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics, while identifying the multifaceted benefits and challenges of such unification. The present paper examines essential research directions for integrating cognitive sciences and advanced technologies, discussing applications in education, healthcare, and business management. We provide suggestions for developing cognitive robots using specific cognitive tasks and explore the ethical implications of these advancements. Our analysis underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to realize the full potential of this integration while mitigating potential risks."
SHARMA20221,The design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming,"The ubiquity of smartphone and tablet devices, combined with the increasing availability of serious games, has enabled students to learn various abstract concepts in an appealing and convenient manner. While several researchers have explored the use of Augmented Reality (AR) in serious games, many of these games have not been critically explained or evaluated. To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players’ qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. We provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work."
WOLFENGAGEN20229,Cognitive technology to capture deep computational concepts with combinators,"Computational activity is now recognized as a natural science, and computational and information processes have been discovered in the deep structures of many areas. Computations in the natural world were present long before the invention of computers, but a remarkable shift in understanding its fundamental nature occurs, in fact, before our eyes. The present moment, in fact, is a transition from the concept of computer science as an artificial science to the understanding that information processes are abundant in nature. Computing is recognized as a natural science that studies natural and artificial information processes. In everyday computing, operations are performed on the individual generators, with little attention paid to their internal structure. However, many common operations consist of more primitive constructions connected by a combination mode. The interaction of information processes and corresponding structures is carried out in an environment of “applicative interaction”, their applications to each other, and the study of the properties of this environment allows us to understand the nature of the computations. In the present work, the main attention is paid to elucidating the technological features of computations with individual generators, or objects. Their interaction is considered in an applicative environment, which allows us to elucidate the internal structure of ordinary operations, the knowledge of which allows us to understand their properties. The choice of initial constant generators, considered as generic ones and expressed by combinators, is discussed. These initial generators are used as the main “building blocks” that occur within the larger blocks of the applicative environment in interaction with each other. As a result of the interaction, constructions arise that give representative sets of ordinary operators and embedded computing systems."
VARTIAINEN2021100281,Machine learning for middle schoolers: Learning through data-driven design,"An entire generation of children is growing up with machine learning (ML) systems that are greatly disrupting job markets as well as changing people’s everyday lives. Yet, that development and its societal effects have been given minor attention in computing education in schools, which mainly focuses on rule-based programming. This article presents a pedagogical framework for supporting middle schoolers to become co-designers and makers of their own machine learning applications. It presents a case study conducted in the 6th grade of a Finnish elementary school and analyzes students’ (N=34) evolving ML ideas and explanations. Data consists of a children’s artwork, students’ design ideas and co-designed applications, and structured group interviews organized at the end of the ML project. The qualitative content analysis revealed how hands-on exploration with ML-based technologies supported students in developing various kinds of design ideas that harnessed face recognition, gestures, or voice recognition for solving real-life problems. The results of the study further indicated that co-designing ML applications provided a promising entry point for students to develop their conceptual understanding of ML principles, its workflows, and its role in their everyday practices. The article concludes with a discussion on how to support students to become innovators and software designers in the age of machine learning."
BREIT2025102621,Mathematics achievement and learner characteristics: A systematic review of meta-analyses,"Learners' individual differences in mathematics achievement are associated with individual differences in psychological characteristics. A number of meta-analyses have quantified the strengths of these correlations. However, these findings are scattered across different strands of the literature. The present systematic review aims to integrate these strands by providing an overview of meta-analyses of psychological correlates of mathematics achievement. We conducted a systematic literature search and included 30 meta-analyses, reporting correlations between mathematics achievement and 66 variables based on 13,853 effect sizes and an estimated 4,658,717 participants. The correlations are rank-ordered by size and complemented with information about the meta-analyses, their inclusion criteria, and methods. The results show strong associations of mathematics achievement with verbal skills and abilities, prior knowledge, intelligence, creativity, math-specific skills, math self-concept, self-regulation, meta-cognition, and executive functions. Relatively weaker relations were observed for emotional intelligence, achievement goals, academic emotions, and the Big Five personality traits."
SMITH2023100616,A research agenda for computational empowerment for emerging technology education,"The article proposes a research agenda for computational empowerment for emerging technologies in the field of child–computer interaction (CCI) – in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). This research agenda includes three levels of operation for future studies: (1) participatory practice, capable of engaging teachers and students in co-developing and designing approaches for teaching and learning emerging technologies, (2) educational principles for integrating technological and societal aspects of emerging technologies, and (3) digital tools for engaging students in construction of and critical reflection on emerging technologies. The research agenda was developed from longitudinal studies of the respective emerging technologies in Danish K–12 education, participatory design research with in-service teachers, development of novel tools and technologies, and literature studies of current CCI research. The paper addresses current gaps in the CCI literature and contributes a coherent approach and guiding questions for future CCI research on computational empowerment for emerging technology in education."
WANG2024100646,Music-driven generative dance movement teaching game based on a multi-feature fusion strategy,"The study aims to develop a music-driven dance teaching game that enhances players' dance learning. By utilizing a multi-feature fusion strategy, the game creates dance movements inspired by music. The model effectively combines music and dance features to generate various dance sequences. In performance tests, the research model successfully matches the tempo and intensity of the music with the generated dance. Overall, this approach improves players' dance movement learning ability. The teaching effectiveness of the research method is significantly superior, with an average value of 95.23 points in the teaching evaluation. In terms of running time, for simple dances, the average generation time is 10 s; for ordinary categories of dances, the average generation time is 15 s; for complex dances, the average generation time is 17 s. The fluency of the generated dances is 97.21 %. The study's findings confirm the effectiveness of the research method. The game's use of multi-feature fusion algorithms allows for adaptive adjustments in difficulty and complexity based on the player's learning situation and ability level. This provides a more diverse and immersive gaming experience, while also presenting innovative ideas for future game development and teaching design."
AKINYEMI2022e01242,Effects of Damping Constant of Electron and Size on Quantum-Based Frequency-dependent Dielectric Function of Small Metallic Plasmonic Devices,"ABSTRACT
Electron surface dissipation and quantum-limited size tend to control the material properties of exterior plasmon oscillation as the size of metal nanoparticles goes into the nanoscale domain. The need to examine this characteristic behaviour and its potential becomes imperative. This study explores the effects of the damping constant of electrons and size quantum-based frequency-dependent dielectric function (FDDF) of small metallic materials using an elementary model of electrons in a confined box. The frequency-dependent dielectric function is employed to study quantum size impacts and damping constant in the optical spectra region. The quantum amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and the absorbing spectra of silver-cube geometry for different sizes by adding damping constant and without damping constant are critically examined. The findings reveal that when the damping constant effect is absent, the multiple crests emerge for the quantum-amended frequency-dependent dielectric function and absorbing spectra of the metallic materials, highlighting the electronic discretization levels in the tiny quantum-limited structure. While the damping constant is included, the multiple summits are hidden and vanish owing to a considerable widening of the structures independently. The change in the numerical results from the quantum case to the classical case for growing widths is further illustrated for both cases. The numerical results enhance our knowledge of damping constant dissipation and quantum limited-size impact in small-scaled plasmonic devices."
DASGUPTA2020554,Technology: Computational Creativity,"The focus of this article is computational creativity, which is concerned with the problem of understanding, theorizing, designing and constructing computational artifacts that manifest behavior which would be deemed ‘creative’ if exhibited by human beings. Historically, this problem is a derivative of the agenda of artificial intelligence (AI) and, thus, is a technological problem. However, as will be seen, even in the specifically technological realm of computational creativity issues pertaining to human creativity cannot be evaded since, at the very least, the criteria for judging and evaluating the creativity of computational artifacts will originate in the realm of human creativity."
KASONGO2023113,A deep learning technique for intrusion detection system using a Recurrent Neural Networks based framework,"In recent years, the spike in the amount of information transmitted through communication infrastructures has increased due to the advances in technologies such as cloud computing, vehicular networks systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. As a result, attackers have multiplied their efforts for the purpose of rendering network systems vulnerable. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to improve the security of those network systems. In this study, an IDS framework using Machine Learning (ML) techniques is implemented. This framework uses different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), namely, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Simple RNN. To assess the performance of the proposed IDS framework, the NSL-KDD and the UNSW-NB15 benchmark datasets are considered. Moreover, existing IDSs suffer from low test accuracy scores in detecting new attacks as the feature dimension grows. In this study, an XGBoost-based feature selection algorithm was implemented to reduce the feature space of each dataset. Following that process, 17 and 22 relevant attributes were picked from the UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD, respectively. The accuracy obtained through the test subsets was used as the main performance metric in conjunction with the F1-Score, the validation accuracy, and the training time (in seconds). The results showed that for the binary classification tasks using the NSL-KDD, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved the best performance with a test accuracy (TAC) of 88.13%, a validation accuracy (VAC) of 99.49% and a training time of 225.46 s. For the UNSW-NB15, the XGBoost-Simple-RNN was the most efficient model with a TAC of 87.07%. For the multiclass classification scheme, the XGBoost-LSTM achieved a TAC of 86.93% over the NSL-KDD and the XGBoost-GRU obtained a TAC of 78.40% over the UNSW-NB15 dataset. These results demonstrated that our proposed IDS framework performed optimally in comparison to existing methods."
FRANCESCA2023756,Mathematical pattern for parametric design: the case study of Grey-Scott cross diffusion model.,"Mathematics offers a virtually infinite range of incomparably beautiful shapes and patterns that can be used in the production of design objects. In particular, the generation of a large number of patterns can be achieved by varying input parameters of reaction-diffusion models, which simulate the distribution of chemicals. These patterns can be used in the customization of objects whose prototypes are made through additive manufacturing (3D printers). This technique allows very complex shapes and unique pieces to be physicalized in a short period of time. This study highlighted the possibility of creating, through a visual script, a potentially infinite catalog of objects based on mathematical patterns, identified using a Grey Scott reaction-diffusion model, those pattern are mapped on a customizable target surface."
KIM202348,High prevalence of self-reported sexually transmitted infections among older adults in Tanzania: results from a list experiment in a population-representative survey,"Purpose
Self-report of sensitive or stigmatized health states is often subject to social desirability and interviewer biases. To reduce such biases, we estimated the rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) using a list experiment.
Methods
This population-representative study was nested within the Dar es Salaam Urban Cohort Study, a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Ukonga ward of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Men and women aged ≥40years were randomly assigned to receive a list of either four control items (i.e., the control group) or four control items plus an additional item on having had a disease through sexual contacts in the past 12months (i.e., the treatment group). We calculated the mean difference in the total number of items to which respondents answered “yes” in the treatment versus control group and compared this prevalence estimate to the one measured by the direct question.
Results
A total of 2310 adults aged ≥40years were enrolled in the study: 32% were male and 48% were aged 40–49years. The estimated prevalence of having STIs in the past 12months was 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.3–23.3) in the list experiment, almost 10 times higher than the estimated prevalence of 1.8% (95%CI 1.3–2.4) based on the direct question (P < .001). STI prevalence remained high after adjusting for age, the number of lifetime sex partners, alcohol consumption and smoking in multivariate linear regression (15.6%; 95% CI 7.3–23.9).
Conclusions
We found a substantially higher prevalence of STIs among older adults in urban Tanzania when we based our estimation on a list experiment rather than a direct question in a population-representative survey. List experiments should be considered to elimnate social desirability and interviewer biases in surveys of sensitive or stigmatized health states. The very high prevalence of STIs highlights the need for improved access to STI screening, prevention and treatment for older adults in urban Africa."

PINHEIRO2024100234,Eye-tracker and fNIRS: Using neuroscientific tools to assess the learning experience during children's educational robotics activities,"In technology education, there has been a paradigmatic shift towards student-centered approaches such as learning by doing, constructionism, and experiential learning. Educational robotics allows students to experiment with building and interacting with their creations while also fostering collaborative work. However, understanding the student's response to these approaches is crucial to adapting them during the teaching-learning process. In this sense, neuroscientific tools such as Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Eye-tracker could be useful, allowing the investigation of relevant states experienced by students. Although they have already been used in educational research, their practical relevance in the teaching-learning process has not been extensively investigated. In this perspective article expressing our position, we bring four examples of learning experiences in a robotics class with children, in which we illustrate the usefulness of these tools."
KIM2023100137,Exploring the AI competencies of elementary school teachers in South Korea,"Although the importance of K–12 artificial intelligence (AI) education grows, the lack of teacher readiness hinders the integration of AI in schools. To address this issue, this study aimed to explore South Korean elementary school teachers' experiences teaching AI curricula and examine their competencies. A survey and interviews were conducted with 67 elementary school teachers who have been working in AI-leading schools in South Korea. The results indicated that teachers were least confident in content knowledge, followed by technological knowledge and pedagogical knowledge relevant to AI. Additionally, interviews with 13 teachers revealed five themes regarding AI education: (1) emphasizing the importance of instructional design in AI education; (2) redesigning the learning environment to promote learning experiences; (3) lowering teaching anxiety by acknowledging the limitations of content knowledge; (4) extending AI education based on computer science (CS) principles; and (5) acquiring literacy in codes, data, AI technologies, and ethical issues. Based on the findings, 22 AI competencies for elementary school teachers were derived and categorized based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The competencies provide a practical framework for teachers to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills for AI education. The study contributes to understanding AI teaching practices in South Korea by revealing teachers’ perspectives on and identifying the essential competencies for practicing AI education."
ZHAN2022100096,The effectiveness of gamification in programming education: Evidence from a meta-analysis,"This paper aimed at constructing a systematic framework and examining the effect of gamification in programming education through a meta-analysis conducted on 21 empirical studies published in the last decade. We examined the effects of game types, gamification applications, pedagogical agents, programming types, and schooling levels on students' academic achievement, cognitive load, motivation, and thinking skills in programming education by cross-tabulation analysis. Results verified the positive impact of gamification in programming education. Gamification has the largest effect on students' motivation, followed by academic achievement, whereas it has the least effect on students' cognitive load. As for game types, the reasoning strategy game is most effective on academic achievement, while the puzzle game is most effective on motivation. As for gamification application, the games as a competitive mechanism has the greatest impact on students’ thinking skills and motivation. However, when games were adopted as teaching tools or student works, the effects are mainly represented in academic achievement. Pedagogical agents have a limited effect on programming education. With regard to programming types, the effect of gamification is more pronounced in text-based programming rather than graphical programming. This study provided an analytic framework and shed light on potential directions for further studies in the field."

OTTENBREITLEFTWICH2021100057,The impact of an issue-centered problem-based learning curriculum on 6th grade girls’ understanding of and interest in computer science,"Many stakeholders have suggested that if girls are not engaged in computer science at an early age, the field of computer science (CS) (and computing-related fields) will continue to lack gender diversity. We need more explorations of how curriculum impacts girls’ interest in computer science at the elementary level. The focus of this research project was to examine how an elementary problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum impacted girls’ understanding of and interest in CS. By utilizing a curriculum focused on a problem that emphasized social activism, we hypothesized that PBL CS could increase interest in CS for girls. This study used a mixed-method sequential explanatory research design to examine the implementation of a CS PBL curriculum with four 6th grade teachers and their 263 students. We collected student CS knowledge pre-tests and post-tests, student attitude surveys, student focus group interviews, teacher interviews, and researcher observation reflection notes. The knowledge tests were analyzed using a mixed measures ANOVA. The survey responses were analyzed using ANOVAs and effect sizes for each comparison were calculated using partial eta squared. The qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic approach that required four researchers to come to a consensus. Results suggested that although girls had less understanding of CS at the beginning, by the end of the curriculum, girls and boys performed similarly. However, there were still elements that were not successful. Girls’ attitudes towards computer science were significantly lower than the boys at the end of the curriculum. Conceptually, the curriculum needs to specifically address how CS could impact values held by girls."
IBARRATORRES2024413,Use of basic programming tools to foster programming logic in university students with school preparation other than computer science,"Teaching programming logic to students who do not have a background in computer science is challenging, as the instructor has to awaken problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning skills Several programming tools have been created to teach coding concepts to computer science students of different ages. However, these tools are not well designed to meet the challenge of teaching programming to new developers who come with school training in other areas such as accounting, management, etc. Therefore, this research focused on analyzing the importance of the application of online programming tools to students starting college who come with a school background in an area other than technology. A pre/post experimental design was carried out with 82 first-level students of the Technical University of Ambato in the careers of Systems and Electronics. The results revealed that 45% of the students increased their levels of application and analysis in programming processes. In addition, the research revealed that students who come from a background other than computer science agree with the integration of online programming tools from the first level of university entrance since this method helps to improve their learning capacity."
ARTHI2025e42080,Research trends and network approach of critical thinking skills in English Language Teaching – A bibliometric analysis implementing R studio,"Critical thinking is often regarded as one of the vital skills in the 21st century. In recent years, it has become important to combine this skill with other skills such as language learning, creativity, problem-solving, decision making, and reflective thinking. As language and thoughts are intertwined and influence each other, incorporating thinking skills into English Language Teaching (ELT) can enhance academic and professional success. The prime objective of the current study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of research on Critical Thinking (CT) in ELT from 2012 to 2022 by focusing on publication and research trends such as influential authors, globally cited documents, pertinent journals, leading countries, and significant affiliations. The current study also sheds light on the co-occurrence of keywords and thematic evolution through bibliometric analysis, examining 238 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases using R studio (Biblioshiny). This bibliometric analysis highlights Thinking Skills and Creativity as the most pertinent journal with high citation count and China being the most cited country in this field. It also accentuates the interconnection between higher-order thinking skills, self-regulation, critical thinking, and critical reading. The thematic evolution of CT shows a shift from collaborative learning and CT (2012–2019) to language teaching and CT (2020–2022). It emphasizes the importance and the rising prominence of CT skills in language teaching. Moreover, this review will guide scholars and academicians to identify future research directions in the field of CT."
OKU2023123,Chapter Six - Analyzing teacher–student interactions through graph theory applied to hyperscanning fNIRS data,"Teacher–student relationships have been found consistently important for student school effectiveness in mathematics in the last three decades. Although this observation is generally made from the teacher's perspective, neuroscience can provide new insights by establishing the neurobiological underpinning of social interactions. This paper further develops this line of research by utilizing graph theory to represent interactions between teachers and students at the neural level. Through hyperscanning with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we collected data from the prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction of 24 dyads composed of a teacher and a student. Each dyad used a board game to perform a programming logic class that consisted of three steps: independent activities (control), presentation of concepts, and interactive exercises. Graph theory provides results regarding the strength of teacher–student interaction and the main channels involved in these interactions. We combined graph modularity and bootstrap to measure pair coactivation, thus establishing the strength of teacher–student interaction. Also, graph centrality detects the main brain channels involved during this interaction. In general, the teacher's most relevant nodes rely on the regions related to language and number processing, spatial cognition, and attention. Also, the students' most relevant nodes rely on the regions related to task management."
SOROKIN2022101177,Skills as declared learning outcomes of entrepreneurship training in higher education institutions across the globe: Classification and analysis with a focus on thinking skills,"The study identifies and classifies skills as declared learning outcomes in entrepreneurship education programs and courses in higher education by looking at globally recognized universities, indexed in authoritative QS ranking and mentioned in literature (43 universities). We analyze descriptions of the declared expected results of entrepreneurship education located on universities’ official websites. We take into account both, available documents and general descriptions on the webpages. The method is manual content-analysis. We find a lack of consistency and high differentiation, including formulations related to thinking skills. We develop the classification of declared outcomes of entrepreneurship education in higher education institutions based on the ideas of human capital theory. This classification considers the role of thinking skills, which remains on periphery of current discussions about learning outcomes of entrepreneurship education."
JAIPALJAMANI2023103,Makerspace and robotics as/for STEM education,"STEM is recognized as a sustainable strategy in education to promote global economic development. However, the goals for STEM education encompass broader outcomes such as STEM literacy. This article positions STEM Education as an integrated field and argues for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches. The integrated STEM approach does present challenges for implementation such as practitioners having insufficient knowledge of STEM disciplines. Robotics and Makerspace are suggested as viable strategies for integrated STEM education. Studies indicate these two approaches provide a relevant context in informal and K-12 educational settings to show connections between STEM subjects and promote learning of STEM content."
SHABABI2025116890,The solution space of a five-dimensional geometry: Kundt spacetimes and cosmological time-crystals,"We uncover the solution space of a five dimensional geometry which we deem it as the direct counterpart of the Bianchi Type V cosmological model. We kinematically reduce the scale factor matrix and then, with an appropriate scaling and choice of time, we cast the spatial equations into a simple “Kasner” like form; thus revealing linear integrals of motion. Their number is enough so that, along with the quadratic constraint, it suffices to scan the entire space of solutions. The latter is revealed to be quite rich, containing cosmological solutions, some of which admit dimensional reduction asymptotically to four dimensions, Kundt spacetimes with vanishing type I (polynomial) curvature scalars and solutions describing periodic universes which behave like cosmological time crystals."
FANG2024100632,An entrepreneurial education game for effectively Tracing the knowledge structure of college students - based on adaptive algorithms,"The application of games in the field of education has brought new developments and updated educational needs to games. To maintain and improve students' learning motivation and interest, and more effectively carry out personalized teaching capabilities, research focuses on students' personalized knowledge structure. Starting from tracking the differences in knowledge structures among different learners, a game model based on entrepreneurial education theory has been designed. Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking. A total of 379 students participated in the experiment. The experimental results on the ASSISTments09 open data set show that the area value under the receptivity curve of this model is 0.913, which is 8.8% to 26.6% higher than that of advanced models of the same type. The performance of the research model is optimal on different training scale data. Students' adaptability to entrepreneurship education games is higher than classroom teaching, with a difference between 2% and 11%. The experimental data demonstrates the high applicability of this research method and also achieves the goal of game design, which has certain practical teaching application value."
ADAMOVIC2024100604,Streamlined approach to 2nd/3rd graders learning basic programming concepts,"There is a growing need to teach schoolchildren programming at an increasingly younger age. The goal of this study is to determine if it is possible to teach schoolchildren basic programming concepts in a streamlined manner. In order to present the new knowledge in a way schoolchildren could understand easily, analogies between basic programming concepts and traffic were used. A simple video game was developed with this in mind and an effort was made to avoid design pitfalls commonly found in edutainment titles. The study involved 112 schoolchildren ages 7 to 9. Test group and control group were given a pre-test, a re-test and a post-test. The re-test and the post-test respectively showed 16% and 7% score difference in favor of the test group. Focusing on questions featuring content analogous to basic programming concepts showed 36% and 20% difference in scores."

Herein, we discuss the structure of an SDL in terms of the hardware, the coordinator software, and the AI agent and examine how the selection of these elements affects the overall research capabilities. We further look to the application and accessibility of these platforms to better understand their future impact on synthetic and materials chemistry. With the rapid rise in the capabilities of these SDLs, and with the increasing democratization of the space, it is crucial to be aware of both the promises and pitfalls this technology holds."
SU2022100065,A meta-review of literature on educational approaches for teaching AI at the K-12 levels in the Asia-Pacific region,"Artificial intelligence (AI) teaching is becoming an increasingly popular topic among educators and researchers, but the research on AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms was under-explored. Currently, most studies examine the curriculum content of the United States and the European countries. However, there has been limited research on AI learning design and activities in the Asia-Pacific region. This meta-review examined 14 research papers on AI curriculum for K-12 classrooms that were taken in the Asia-Pacific region from 2018 to 2021 by identifying the content knowledge, tools, platforms, activities, theories and models, assessment methods, and learning outcomes of the selected studies. The results indicated that AI curricula can develop students' AI knowledge and skills, learning attitudes, and interests. Furthermore, the research on AI education was conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods which are useful for future educators and researchers to understand how they assess students’ AI learning performance. We also derive a set of implications for innovative pedagogical designs in terms of educational standards, curriculum designs, formal/informal education, student learning outcomes, teacher professional development and learning progressions to recommend how governments, researchers and educators could build a widely-accepted and age-appropriate AI curriculum for all K-12 learners."
LENNON2022104608,Young children's social and independent behavior during play with a coding app: Digital game features matter in a 1:1 child to tablet setting,"The overarching aim of this study was to explore young children's (N = 25, Mage = 5.16 years) play with two coding games (Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable) in a 1:1 child to tablet setting. We had three research questions focused on children's game play: 1) How does the structure of each game influence children's play? 2) Do children play more or less independently depending on the game they play? 3) Do children who play the games more independently learn more coding skills? Three researchers coded more than 6 h of video data showing children's play with digital coding games. Findings include, that the type of game did influence the different ways that children behaved while playing. However, during both games, children had the same amount of independent play. Children who played more independently during Daisy the Dinosaur learned more coding skills. This may be because these children were focusing more on the game than their peers as we did not find a similar effect for the game Kodable. We discuss the ways that children play structured vs. open structured (i.e., sandbox) digital games with a particular focus on how game play may influence learning. As opportunities for individual device ownership in classrooms increase, future work should continue to explore how game features influence learning."
MOORE2022104596,From the learner's perspective: A systematic review of MOOC learner experiences (2008–2021),"We report the results of a systematic review of learners' experiences and perspectives in massive open online courses (MOOCs). This systematic review includes 51 articles published between 2008 and 2021 that appeared in top educational technology journals. Each article provides insight into the MOOC learner experience, and our analysis identified three themes: motivation, course engagement, and satisfaction and achievement. Our study identifies three implications for MOOC course design – clear course structure, engagement among learners, and learner-centered. Understanding the differences in learner motivations to enroll in a course necessitates careful consideration of learner experiences within MOOCs. This systematic review provides valuable insight into how learners' experiences are captured and used to influence course design and evaluation."
ABDALLA2025101310,Understanding ChatGPT adoption for data analytics learning: A UTAUT perspective among social science students in Oman,"Generative artificial intelligence tools, particularly ChatGPT, have shown the potential to reshape education by providing personalized, efficient, and accessible learning experiences across various academic disciplines. Despite concerns about academic integrity and AI-driven misconduct, its potential to revolutionize how students engage with and master complex subjects is undeniable. This study explores the key factors that influence social science students' adoption of ChatGPT as a transformative tool to enhance their learning of data analytics. Using a descriptive quantitative research design, data were collected from a sample of 413 Omani students. The study utilizes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a guiding theoretical framework. Through ordinal logistic regression analysis, the study identifies performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, self-efficacy, and effort expectancy as significant predictors of students' decisions to adopt ChatGPT for their learning needs. Descriptive findings reveal that students highly value ChatGPT's capability to simplify complex data analytics concepts and assist in selecting appropriate analytical methods. This demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing conceptual understanding. However, the tool received lower ratings for tasks such as data pre-processing and cleaning, suggesting some limitations in its effectiveness in these aspects of data analytics learning. The study's findings highlight ChatGPT's substantial potential to enhance academic performance in data analytics and provide practical recommendations for students, instructors and institutions. The focus is on strategically integrating AI technologies to optimize instructional effectiveness and foster deeper student engagement with data analytics curricula."
CAMPBELL2022108635,In search of experimental evidence on Scratch programming and students’ achievements in the first-year college computing class? Consider these datasets,"This article presents datasets representing the demographics and achievements of computer science students in their first programming courses (CS1). They were collected from a research project comparing the effects of a constructionist Scratch programming and the conventional instructions on the achievements of CS1 students from selected Nigerian public colleges. The project consisted of two consecutive quasi-experiments. In both cases, we adopted a non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design and multistage sampling. Institutions were selected following purposive sampling, and those selected were randomly assigned to the Scratch programming class (experimental) and the conventional (comparison) class. A questionnaire and pre- and post-introductory programming achievement tests were used to collect data. To strengthen the research design, we used the Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) algorithm to create matched samples from the unmatched data obtained from both experiments. Future studies can use these data to identify the factors influencing CS1 students' performance, investigate how programming pedagogies or tools affect CS1 students' achievements in higher education, identify important trends using machine learning techniques, and address additional research ideas."
OLADEJO2024111880,The Hiking Optimization Algorithm: A novel human-based metaheuristic approach,"In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called ‘The Hiking Optimization Algorithm’ (HOA) is proposed. HOA is inspired by hiking, a popular recreational activity, in recognition of the similarity between the search landscapes of optimization problems and the mountainous terrains traversed by hikers. HOA’s mathematical model is premised on Tobler’s Hiking Function (THF), which determines the walking velocity of hikers (i.e. agents) by considering the elevation of the terrain and the distance covered. THF is employed in determining hikers’ positions in the course of solving an optimization problem. HOA’s performance is demonstrated by benchmarking with 29 well-known test functions (including unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions), three engineering design problems (EDPs), (including I-beam, tension/compression spring, and gear train problems) and two N-P Hard problems (i.e. Traveling Salesman’s and Knapsack Problems). Moreover, HOA’s results are verified by comparison to 14 other metaheuristics, including Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) as well as newly introduced algorithms such as Komodo Mlipir Algorithm (KMA), Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO), and Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVIDOA). In this study, we employ statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon rank sum, Friedman test, and Dunn’s post hoc test for the performance evaluation. HOA’s results are competitive and, in many instances, outperform the aforementioned well-known metaheuristics. The source codes of HOA and related metaheuristics can be accessed publicly via this link: https://github.com/DayoSun/The-Hiking-Optimization-Algorithm."
TONDEUR2025105262,Preparing preservice teachers to teach with digital technologies: An update of effective SQD-strategies,"This systematic review responds to the critical need to equip preservice teachers with the competencies to use technologies within an increasingly digital educational landscape. Given the fact that new ways to learn digitally are constantly emerging, new strategies are needed to support future teachers' digital practices in a different context. This replication study builds upon the Synthesis of Qualitative Data (SQD) model, offering an updated synthesis of effective strategies. Using the PRISMA-methodology, the study critically analyses qualitative evidence from the past 12 years, identifying both persisting and emerging strategies for preservice teacher preparation in the digital age. Findings from the updated SQD-model (SQD2) introduce new themes, including “Digital Identity”, “Instructional Design Models”, and “Affective Dimensions.” These new themes complement the original SQD-model by addressing diverse experiences and technology-specific pedagogical approaches. The discussion section explores the implications and practical applications of these findings, highlighting pathways to enhance digital competency in preservice teacher education."
HUGHESROBERTS2020103988,Examining the potential impact of digital game making in curricula based teaching: Initial observations,"Digital game making is becoming an increasingly common means of learning in schools due to the appeal of delivering curriculum-based learning objectives while tapping into the popularity of videogames. Indeed, research suggests that digital game making may improve cognitive and behavioral skills in learners and this may have significant impact on learners with special education needs and disabilities (SEND). However, past work in digital game making has limited involvement with learners with SEND, focuses on short-term evaluations and is utilised during extra-curricular sessions with few studies using an action-based field research approach. Furthermore, there is little quantitative data from defined methodologies that demonstrate the impact of digital game-making on learning. This paper presents results from two field trials examining the use of digital game making in two schools (one mixed ability primary and one special school) to deliver national curriculum-based content over 8-weeks. Results from a feasibility trial informed a pedagogical design and identified evaluation metrics for a subsequent longer trial. Evaluation metrics included learner engagement and collaboration with peers as suitable indicators of inclusive learning. Impact on these metrics was measured using an in-class observation tool that sampled learner behavior yielding quantitative data and follow up interviews with teachers yielding qualitative data. Results suggest that digital game making is at least as effective in encouraging engagement and collaboration in learners when compared to traditional methods, with it being more engaging for learners with special needs. Contributions from this paper provide quantifiable evidence for the perceived benefits of using digital game making and a methodology for evaluating engagement and collaboration through classroom observation. Recommendations for further work and refinements of the pedagogical implementation that builds on these findings are presented."
GIANNAKOS2020100204,Movement forward: The continued growth of Child–Computer Interaction research,"In this inaugural editorial as the new and the past editors-in-chief of the International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction (IJCCI), we take stock of the journal’s progress in its first 8 years of existence, and we describe our views and plans to support the journal maintain its positive trajectory as the premier journal in the multidisciplinary area of Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) and Interaction Design and Children, and a respected and leading journal in the fields of human–computer interaction, interaction design (IDC) and the learning sciences.

TAO2023100116,Towards an understanding of the engagement and emotional behaviour of MOOC students using sentiment and semantic features,"Online learning and teaching increased in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. As many researchers attempted to understand the impact stress had on the emotional behaviours and academic performance of students, most studies explored these pre- and during-COVID behaviours in the context of brick and mortar institutions transitioning to online delivery. There is an opportunity to compare the experiences of students in the MOOC environment in this period, particularly in terms of the difference of engagement, semantics and sentiment/stress behaviours in 2019 and 2020. In this study, we use a dataset from AdelaideX between this time period to identify the most significant features that impact student outcomes. Where previous machine learning approaches used singular features such as student interaction or sentiment in discussion forum posts, we incorporate three feature categories of engagement, semantics and sentiment/stress in an ensemble model is based on voting and stacked methods to determining the relationship between them and academic performance. From our results, we discover that sentiment/stress played little part in academic performance and was relatively unchanged in online courses in this dataset between 2019 and 2020. We present two individual student cases to further contextualise our findings."
KRUSKOPF2024104574,Future teachers’ self-efficacy in teaching practical and algorithmic ICT competencies – Does background matter?,"Future teachers need to be confidently equipped to teach 21st century ICT skills. We investigated teaching self-efficacy (TSE) in ICT competencies among teacher students. We confirmed distinct ICT competencies among two cohorts from teacher training programs (n = 347; n = 428): practical (i.e., device and data management), and algorithmic (i.e., programming, and data security). Regression analyses indicated TSE-biases regarding younger age, male gender, and a background in natural sciences, with significant interactions between age, gender, and having learned such ICT-skills already in school. The findings point to a need for tailored strategies in teacher education to mitigate TSE disparities."
BUCAIONI2024100526,Programming with ChatGPT: How far can we go?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable strides, giving rise to the development of large language models such as ChatGPT. The chatbot has garnered significant attention from academia, industry, and the general public, marking the beginning of a new era in AI applications. This work explores how well ChatGPT can write source code. To this end, we performed a series of experiments to assess the extent to which ChatGPT is capable of solving general programming problems. Our objective is to assess ChatGPT’s capabilities in two different programming languages, namely C++ and Java, by providing it with a set of programming problem, encompassing various types and difficulty levels. We focus on evaluating ChatGPT’s performance in terms of code correctness, run-time efficiency, and memory usage. The experimental results show that, while ChatGPT is good at solving easy and medium programming problems written in C++ and Java, it encounters some difficulties with more complicated tasks in the two languages. Compared to code written by humans, the one generated by ChatGPT is of lower quality, with respect to runtime and memory usage."
LAUPICHLER2022100101,Artificial intelligence literacy in higher and adult education: A scoping literature review,"Since artificial intelligence (AI) is finding its way into more and more areas of everyday life, improving the AI skills of non-experts is important and will become even more relevant in the future. While it is necessary that children learn about the possibilities of AI at an early age, adults in higher education and beyond should also have at least a basic understanding of AI (i.e., AI literacy) to be able to interact effectively with the technology. To evaluate the current state of the literature on AI literacy in higher and adult education, a scoping literature review was conducted with the objective of identifying thematic foci and recent research trends. Ten research databases were searched and out of 902 initial records, 30 studies were identified using predefined eligibility criteria, whereof the content was evaluated in the review. The results indicated that research in this area is still in its infancy and needs refinement in terms of how to define AI literacy in adult education as well as what content should be taught to non-experts. Lastly, several recommendations for research and practice are derived from the results."

KORTE2023100547,Editorial: Pushing the boundaries of Participatory Design with children,"Participatory Design (PD) with children allows children to contribute to, or have control over, the development of technologies for themselves and others like them. However, the children who are most likely to be involved in PD are often the most privileged. This special issue seeks to push the boundaries of PD with children. The papers published in this special issue examine designing with children from many countries; designing with minority groups; digital distributed PD; the right length for PD projects; and new approaches to PD."
CLEARY2022103619,Professional development in self-regulated learning: Shifts and variations in teacher outcomes and approaches to implementation,"The purpose of this explanatory, sequential mixed methods study was to examine pretest - posttest changes in high school teachers' knowledge of self-regulated learning (SRL) and their self-efficacy and skills in applying SRL following a professional development (PD) workshop. Teacher interviews and qualitative analyses were used to assess differences in teachers’ attitudes, perceptions, and experiences when implementing SRL. In general, the 19 teachers showed large gains across all measures at posttest. Teachers who displayed advanced SRL skills following the PD exhibited more flexible, responsive, and positive perspectives on implementing SRL in the classroom than teachers with emerging SRL skills."
WANG2022102240,What is the competence boundary of Algorithms? An institutional perspective on AI-based video generation,"As automated journalism based on AI came into being, it is important to understand the algorithm competence possibilities and limitations for the institutional facilitating the human–machine collaboration. Meanwhile, videos become mainstream in the advertisement realm. To expand the scope of research from journalism to advertisement, from text news to video, a comparative study was conducted to examine how the users perceive the video created by AI and humans. There is no significant difference explicitly, but the implicit appraisals were in favor of human-generated video. The key discussion is the boundary thinking of AI in both the academic and industrial spheres."
LI2025112016,The neural correlates of logical-mathematical symbol systems processing resemble those of spatial cognition more than language processing,"Summary
The ability to use logical-mathematical symbols (LMS), encompassing tasks such as calculation, reasoning, and programming, is special to humans with recent emergence. LMS processing was suggested to build upon fundamental cognitive systems through neuronal recycling, with natural language processing and spatial cognition as key candidates. This study used meta-analyses and synthesized neural maps of representative LMS tasks, including reasoning, calculation, and mental programming, to compare their neural correlates with those of the two systems. Our results revealed greater activation overlap and multivariate similarity between LMS and spatial cognition than with language processing. Hierarchical clustering further indicated that LMS tasks were indistinguishable from spatial tasks at the neural level, suggesting an inherent connection. Our findings support the hypothesis that spatial cognition is the basis of LMS processing, shedding light on the logical reasoning limitations of large language models, particularly those lacking explicit spatial representations."
CELLA2024107262,"Integrated analyses of the transmission history of SARS-CoV-2 and its association with molecular evolution of the virus underlining the pandemic outbreaks in Italy, 2019-2023","Background
Italy was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, experiencing multiple waves of infection following the sequential emergence of new variants. Understanding the transmission patterns and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is vital for future preparedness.
Methods
We conducted an analysis of viral genome sequences, integrating epidemiological and phylodynamic approaches, to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 variants have spread within the country.
Results
Our findings indicate bidirectional international transmission, with Italy transitioning between importing and exporting the virus. Italy experienced four distinct epidemic waves, each associated with a significant reduction in fatalities from 2021 to 2023. These waves were primarily driven by the emergence of VOCs such as Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, which were reflected in observed transmission dynamics and effectiveness of public health measures.
Conclusions
The changing patterns of viral spread and variant prevalence throughout Italy's pandemic response underscore the continued importance of flexible public health strategies and genomic surveillance, both of which are crucial for tracking the evolution of variants and adapting control measures effectively to ensure preparedness for future outbreaks."
SANDHU2025101728,"Understanding entrepreneurial thinking for designers: Perspectives from entrepreneurs, academicians, product designers, and students","Entrepreneurship education is increasingly vital across disciplines to equip students with the skills to address complex global challenges. However, a clear and unified understanding of entrepreneurial thinking, particularly within engineering education, remains lacking. This study aims to develop a comprehensive definition of entrepreneurial thinking suitable for integration into engineering curricula. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eleven participants, including entrepreneurs, academicians, and product designers from diverse fields, such as product design, textile, ergonomics, finance, biomedical engineering, computer science, and mechanical engineering. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically keyword extraction and topic modeling with Latent Semantic Indexing, we analyzed the interview transcripts to identify key terms and themes. From this analysis, we extracted the top 50 words and identified the top 20 topics related to entrepreneurial thinking. Brainstorming sessions with product designers were then held to construct definitions based on these findings. Through majority and relationship analysis, we derived a unified definition of entrepreneurial thinking. The final definition was compared with variations of definitions prepared by undergraduate design students, revealing that students had a vague understanding of the concept. To address this gap, we proposed a framework that integrates the developed definition with engineering course elements using the Lean Canvas Model. This framework aligns engineering education with entrepreneurial skills without adding a significant workload, serving as a practical tool for educators. This study provides a unified definition of entrepreneurial thinking and offers a practical framework for its integration into engineering education, thereby fostering an entrepreneurial mindset among future engineers."
RAMIREZMONTOYA202432,Expanding horizons for the future with an open educational model for complex thinking: external and internal validation,"Purpose
The challenges facing 21st-century society are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the development of new citizen competencies.

XU2024101574,The effectiveness of educational interventions on thinking and operational skills in complex learning—A meta-analysis,"In the 21st century, the requirements for talent abilities are becoming increasingly diversified. Traditional skill learning methods cannot meet this demand, while complex learning can adapt to this demand for talent. In complex learning systems, various factors such as instructional theory, instructional interventions, and technology work together to facilitate the acquisition of complex thinking or operational skills. However, the effectiveness of instructional factors in complex skills learning remains unknown. To find out the effects of these factors on the acquisition of different complex skills, this meta-analysis includes 60 empirical studies and the effectiveness of 4C/ID model, instructional interventions and technical support on different complex learning are investigated. Complex skills learning had a moderate positive overall effect in acquiring complex skills: g = 0.67, 95% CI [0.49, 0.85]. Both thinking skills (g = 0.69, 95% CI [0.44, 0.94], k = 40) and operational skills (g = 0.64, 95% CI [0.38, 0.89], k = 20) showed moderate positive effects, and there was small but not statistically significant difference in the effect sizes between the two groups. Funnel plot, Egger's test and Rank Correlation Test results show that the findings were likely not to be affected by publication bias. We conclude that: compared to traditional learning, (1) the 4C/ID model is more suitable for thinking skills learning and has a significant large positive promotion effect. (2) Different instructional interventions can play a positive role in promoting the learning of complex skills. Learning scaffolding and learning platforms and tools are more suitable for operational skills learning, while thinking skills learning can benefit more from the adjustment of instructional models. (3) A variety of technologies can have a high effect on facilitating complex thinking and operational skills. These results show that different instructional interventions and technical support play a vital role in the learning of complex skills. In practical application, we need to make reasonable selection and application according to the specific educational situation and complex skills."
WILLIAMS2023105178,Volatile terpenoid profiling in gin and beer – A targeted approach,"In the current work, an online HS-SPME-GCMS method was optimized and applied to the quantitative determination of 53 terpenoids. Sample preparation conditions and method performance were evaluated. Precision ranged from 1% to 10% for beer and 2–12% for gin, accuracy from 84 % to 118% for beer and 10–124% for gin. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for beer ranged from 0.04 to 6 µg/L and 0.1–19 µg/L respectively. LOD and LOQ for gin ranged from 0.02 to 2.3 µg/L and 0.05–7.5 µg/L respectively. In addition, the stability of selected terpenoids (as class representatives) was assessed in a synthetic beer using a targeted and non-targeted approach at various temperatures (4, 25 and 50C) over 40 days. The optimized method was successfully applied to commercial craft beers (n = 34) and gins (n = 21). The main contributors to the beer profile were β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, linalool, α-terpineol, citronellol, and geraniol, and for gin 1,8-cineole, cis-rose oxide, linalool, α-terpineol, valencene, and citronellol. This first report of such a large number of terpenoids determined in one run and quantified using authentic standards can make a significant contribution to the knowledge of products that require a fast and accurate terpenoid screening method."
AYANWALE2022100099,Teachers’ readiness and intention to teach artificial intelligence in schools,"The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a subject to be incorporated into K-12 educational levels places new demand on relevant stakeholders, especially teachers that drive the teaching and learning process. It is therefore important to understand how ready teachers are to teach the emerging subject as the success of AI education would probably be closely dependent on the readiness of teachers. As a result, this study presents an insight into factors influencing the behavioural intention and readiness of Nigerian in-service teachers to teach artificial intelligence. A total of 368 teachers, from elementary to high school participated in the study. We utilised quantitative methodology using variance-based structural equation modelling to understand the relationship among the eight variables (AI anxiety, perceived usefulness, AI for social good, Attitude towards using AI, perceived confidence in teaching AI, relevance of AI, AI readiness, and behavioural intention) considered in the study. The result indicated that confidence in teaching AI predicts intention to teach AI while AI relevance strongly predicts readiness to teach AI. While other factors influence the teaching of AI, anxiety and social good could not predict teachers' intention and readiness to implement AI in classrooms respectively.

CHOGA202491,Rapid dynamic changes of FL.2 variant: A case report of COVID-19 breakthrough infection,"We investigated intra-host genetic evolution using two SARS-CoV-2 isolates from a fully vaccinated (primary schedule x2 doses of AstraZeneca plus a booster of Pfizer), >70-year-old woman with a history of lymphoma and hypertension who presented a SARS-CoV-2 infection for 3 weeks prior to death due to COVID-19. Two full genome sequences were determined from samples taken 13 days apart with both belonging to Pango lineage FL.2: the first detection of this Omicron sub-variant in Botswana. FL.2 is a sub-lineage of XBB.1.9.1. The repertoire of mutations and minority variants in the Spike protein differed between the two time points. Notably, we also observed deletions within the ORF1a and Membrane proteins; both regions are associated with high T-cell epitope density. The internal milieu of immune-suppressed individuals may accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution; hence, close monitoring is warranted."
PIRES2022100382,Learning maths with a tangible user interface: Lessons learned through participatory design with children with visual impairments and their educators,"Through a set of participatory design (PD) sessions with children with visual impairments and their educators, we understood current practices in maths teaching, and designed a novel system to support learning for this particular educational context. Sixteen children were engaged in 19 PD sessions to develop tangibles and auditory stimuli to represent numbers, and to explore activities to use through a tangible user interface. We describe the context and lessons learned along the PD process with children and educators, and their implications on the design. Two main outputs were derived: iCETA, a multimodal tangible user interface that allows the use of tangible blocks to represent numbers; and, Logarín, an audiogame designed for iCETA that enables mathematical training. We explored the use of iCETA and Logarín during 15 sessions with 11 children with visual impairments. Results indicate that playing Logarín is engaging and capable of promoting their mathematical abilities. This research supports evidence that PD is successful in bringing children and other stakeholders together to design a solution that fits children’s needs and promises educational impact."
LAUTENBACHER2024129583,Petz recovery maps for qudit quantum channels,"This study delves into the efficacy of the Petz recovery map within the context of two paradigmatic quantum channels: dephasing and amplitude-damping. While prior investigations have predominantly focused on qubits, our research extends this inquiry to higher-dimensional systems. We introduce a novel, state-independent framework based on the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism to evaluate the performance of the Petz map. By analyzing different channels and the (non-)unital nature of these processes, we emphasize the pivotal role of the reference state selection in determining the map's effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the considerable impact of suboptimal choices on performance, prompting a broader consideration of factors such as system dimensionality."
GIOVANETTI2022,A Retrospective Overview of Zika Virus Evolution in the Midwest of Brazil,"Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality of arboviral infections in Brazil, such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and yellow fever, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited availability of genomic data to track and control the epidemic. In this study, we provide a retrospective reconstruction of the Zika virus transmission dynamics in the state of Goiás by analyzing genomic data from areas in Midwest Brazil not covered by other previous studies.
ABSTRACT
Since the introduction of the Zika virus (ZIKV) into Brazil in 2015, its transmission dynamics have been intensively studied in many parts of the country, although much is still unknown about its circulation in the midwestern states. Here, using nanopore technology, we obtained 23 novel partial and near-complete ZIKV genomes from the state of Goiás, located in the Midwest of Brazil. Genomic, phylogenetic, and epidemiological approaches were used to retrospectively explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the ZIKV-Asian genotype in this region. As a likely consequence of a gradual accumulation of herd immunity, epidemiological data revealed a decline in the number of reported cases over 2018 to 2021. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that multiple independent introductions of the Asian lineage have occurred in Goiás over time and revealed a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlight the utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understand mosquito-borne epidemics.

Together, our results highlight the utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understand mosquito-borne epidemics, revealing how this toolkit can be used to help policymakers prioritize areas to be targeted, especially in the context of finite public health resources."
KONG2021104267,Investigating primary school principals’ programming perception and support from the perspective of reasoned action: A mixed methods approach,"Programming is perceived to be an indispensable type of literacy in the digital era. To effectively promote and implement programming in K–12 education, it is necessary to understand school principals' perception of programming education. This study adopted a mixed methods design to explain principals’ understanding, expectations, and support for programming education in primary schools using Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). In study 1, survey questionnaires were distributed to all principals from public primary schools in Hong Kong. Two hundred and sixty-six principals responded to the survey (response rate = 55.6%). In study 2, a follow-up interview study with 13 principals was conducted to further explore their perception of programming education. The results of study 1 indicated that principals with a better understanding of programming education tend to have clearer expectations of how to implement programming education in their schools, which consequently leads to greater support for the implementation of programming education. In study 2, the thematic analysis further supported the results obtained in study 1. Specifically, the results of study 2 demonstrated that most principals show understanding, expectation, and support for the implementation of programming education, which in turn results in various positive student and teacher outcomes. The results also showed that challenges are inevitable during implementation, principals show capabilities and willingness to adjust their expectation and support to better integrate programming education into their school curricula."
BEHNAMNIA2025101816,Relationship between creative thinking and outcomes in a digital STEM-based learning environment: A mixed methods case study,"Over the past few years, technology and digital methods have been increasingly integrated into education, offering new forms of learning. However, it remains unclear and difficult to assess how this integration of technology may impact children's intellectual capacities and their motivation for learning. The purpose of this research is to assess and evaluate the effect of key indicators for creative thinking skills on increased achievement and motivation in learning Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). In this study, the authors aim to determine whether children aged between 3 and 6 can provide creative solutions for learning difficulties in a digital environment. Moreover, the authors have identified and assessed children's behaviors that enhance their learning achievement and motivation. To achieve this, a mixed-methods case study approach was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. The ""Analyzing Children's Creative Thinking"" (ACCT) framework was used to investigate and identify the impact of key creative thinking skills indicators. Additionally, Motivational Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MSLQ) were used to evaluate children's perceptions and motivation in the digital STEM-based learning environment. The findings indicate that digital STEM-based learning has the potential to influence students' ability to develop creative skills and critical thinking, as well as foster positive attitudes toward learning, which may lead to deep and meaningful learning experiences. The results of psychomotor testing of children before and after playing in the STEM-based learning environment demonstrate the typical developmental profile of fine motor skills during learning for the participating children. This research may provide parents, teachers, and researchers with valuable insights, recommendations, and suggestions on how to enhance creative skills and improve learning outcomes in the digital environment."

More empirical studies are called to test the effectiveness of these strategies to facilitate and assess interdisciplinary science learning in different domains and contexts."
HASENBEIN2022107282,Learning with simulated virtual classmates: Effects of social-related configurations on students’ visual attention and learning experiences in an immersive virtual reality classroom,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) provides great potential to experimentally investigate effects of peers on student learning in class and to strategically deploy virtual peer learners to improve learning. The present study examined how three social-related classroom configurations (i.e., students' position in the classroom, visualization style of virtual avatars, and virtual classmates' performance-related behavior) affect students' visual attention toward information presented in the IVR classroom using a large-scale eye-tracking data set of N = 274 sixth graders. ANOVA results showed that the IVR configurations were systematically associated with differences in learners' visual attention on classmates or the instructional content and their overall gaze distribution in the IVR classroom (Cohen's d ranging from 0.28 to 2.04 for different IVR configurations and gaze features). Gaze-based attention on classmates was negatively related to students' interest in the IVR lesson (d = 0.28); specifically, the more boys were among the observed peers, the lower students' situational self-concept (d = 0.24). In turn, gaze-based attention on the instructional content was positively related to students' performance after the IVR lesson (d = 0.26). Implications for the future use of IVR classrooms in educational research and practice are discussed."
ADENIJI2025,Unveiling novel features and phylogenomic assessment of indigenous Priestia megaterium AB-S79 using comparative genomics,"ABSTRACT

Priestia megaterium strain AB-S79 isolated from active gold mine soil previously expressed in vitro heavy metal resistance and has a 5.7 Mb genome useful for biotechnological exploitation. This study used web-based bioinformatic resources to analyze P. megaterium AB-S79 genomic relatedness, decipher its secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), and better comprehend its taxa. Genes were highly conserved across the 14 P. megaterium genomes examined here. The pangenome reflected a total of 61,397 protein-coding genes, 59,745 homolog protein family hits, and 1,652 singleton protein family hits. There were also 7,735 protein families, including 1,653 singleton families and 6,082 homolog families. OrthoVenn3 comparison of AB-S79 protein sequences with 13 other P. megaterium strains, 7 other Priestia spp., and 6 other Bacillus spp. highlighted AB-S79’s unique genomic and evolutionary trait. antiSMASH identified two key transcription factor binding site regulators in AB-S79’s genome: zinc-responsive repressor (Zur) and antibiotic production activator (AbrC3), plus putative enzymes for the biosynthesis of terpenes and ranthipeptides. AB-S79 also harbors BGCs for two unique siderophores (synechobactins and schizokinens), phosphonate, dienelactone hydrolase family protein, and phenazine biosynthesis protein (phzF), which is significant for this study. Phosphonate particularly showed specificity for the P. megaterium sp. validating the effect of gene family expansion and contraction. P. megaterium AB-S79 looks to be a viable source for value-added compounds. Thus, this study contributes to the theoretical framework for the systematic metabolic and genetic exploitation of the P. megaterium sp., particularly the value-yielding strains.
IMPORTANCE

WANG2024102579,Artificial intelligence in dance education: Using immersive technologies for teaching dance skills,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a shift in modern dance education. Immersive technologies have become increasingly common worldwide, helping educators to improve the quality of dance pedagogy and increase the effectiveness of dance training. The article investigates the ways of using immersive technologies powered by artificial intelligence in dance education. The research explores the theoretical literature on dance education and the use of artificial intelligence in dance education and dance choreography. The scholars examine the impact of innovative technology solutions used in dance pedagogical practice on the development of dance skills in students. The study also discusses the functionality of interactive and multimedia dance teaching systems, including AI-powered virtual mentoring and cognitive simulations of human mind operations. The research analysed the use of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) in dance education. This research also focuses on mobile applications used for teaching modern dance. The proposed framework for dance education is based on digital technologies, which help to develop dance skills and improve teaching practices. The scholars conclude that the development and improvement of dance skills are possible only if a teacher combines virtual and real environments in everyday practices. The findings can be used by dance teachers, professional dancers, software developers, and researchers who examine the innovative practices and the application of artificial intelligence in dance education. The ecosystem model reframes thinking about approaches to dance education and can serve as the basis for further development of dance courses and dance style teaching modes."
YU2025103745,The impact of individual AI proficiency on human–agent collaboration: Higher sensitivity to discern the comprehension ability of intelligent agents for users with higher AI proficiency levels,"This study explored the impact of individual artificial intelligence (AI) proficiency on task scores, human perceptions of the agent's intelligence and anthropomorphism, trust, and mental workload from the perspective of human–agent collaboration. A 2 (Individual AI Proficiency, between-subjects) × 2 (Intelligent Agent's Comprehension Ability for Human Intentions, within-subjects) mixed experimental design was implemented in a task in which the participants and intelligent agents collaborated to navigate an unknown map. Forty participants participated in this study. The results revealed significant interaction effects between human AI proficiency and the agents' comprehension abilities on human trust, perceived intelligence, and perceived anthropomorphism. Users with higher AI proficiency demonstrated greater trust, perceived intelligence, and anthropomorphism when interacting with intelligent agents that interpreted human intention based on both immediate and previous feedback, compared to intelligent agents based solely on immediate feedback, displaying a higher sensitivity to the change in agents' ability. Additionally, intelligent agents that interpret human intentions based on both immediate and previous feedback significantly reduce users' mental workload compared with those that rely solely on immediate feedback."
ADAMS2024593,Nature's novel materials: A review of quantum biology,"Quantum biology is, most simply, the investigation of quantum effects in biological systems. While all matter is fundamentally quantum, quantum biology focuses on those quantum effects that result in properties of biological scale and relevance. It has long been argued that quantum effects are incompatible with biological systems, due to the likelihood of decoherence. But nature is a surprising and enterprising engineer. In this sense, quantum biology is the study of nature's materials and how they might sustain and enhance quantum effects, even in hot and wet environments. Quantum mechanics was developed in response to seemingly anomalous interactions between light and matter. It seems fitting that a great deal of the progress made in quantum biology in the last few decades has been on the topic of photosynthesis: the interaction of light with living matter. The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter is also at the heart of many other topics of quantum biology. This review is a broad overview of the current state of this research. While the underlying quantum effects are often similar—energy and charge transfer, tunnelling, spin dynamics—the biological contexts are varied and continue to grow. These contexts include enzyme catalysis, DNA mutation, receptor binding, photosynthesis, microtubule and mitochondrial function, magnetoreception, regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species, calcium ion storage and release and, potentially, consciousness. While there remain a number of reservations regarding quantum biology, progress made in this regard might further our understanding of both quantum and biological systems. With respect to the latter, advances in understanding biology might also contribute to a better understanding of physiology and the development of new therapeutics. But quantum biology might equally advance our understanding of quantum mechanics, by illustrating what quantum effects could look like in the novel materials out of which living systems are built."
MISHRA2024108508,An integrated picture fuzzy standard deviation and pivot pairwise assessment method for assessing the drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions,"Information and communication technologies play a significant role in all aspects of modern society. It has become a subject of high significance in all perspectives, mainly in the workstation. Consequently, the main objective for universities and schools is to develop future specialists for handling the problems and finding the effective outcomes by their digital competency as a significant ability. In higher education institutions, assessing the key drivers of digital transformation is a complicated decision-making problem as the multiple factors are involved in it. To this aim, a novel picture fuzzy information-based decision-making framework is proposed to assess the key drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions. In this regard, an improved score function is proposed to rank the picture fuzzy numbers. In addition, it is used to determine the weights of decision experts. Next, some generalized Dombi aggregation operators are proposed to aggregate the picture fuzzy information. Further, an integrated criteria weighting model is presented based on the combination of objective weights through standard deviation-based model and subjective weights through pivot pairwise relative criteria importance assessment (PIPRECIA) model in the context of picture fuzzy sets. To rank the alternatives, a picture fuzzy extension of alternative ranking order model accounting for two step normalization (AROMAN) approach is proposed using the score function, Dombi operators and integrated weighting model. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated using a case study of key drivers' assessment of digital transformation in higher education institutions. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are discussed to reveal the consistency, robustness and efficiency of introduced model. This study offers a new decision-making framework, which makes a significant contribution to the key drivers’ assessment process from uncertainty perspective."
HONTELEZ2025103233,The impact of the PEPFAR funding freeze on HIV deaths and infections: a mathematical modelling study of seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa,"Summary
Background
On January 24, 2025, the United States government issued an executive order to freeze all foreign aid programs, including The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), for 90 days. A limited waiver option became available, but its implementation remains incomplete. We estimated the impact of these policy changes on HIV deaths and new infections in seven sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries—Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe –, which together account for about half of all people living with HIV in SSA.
Methods
We used STDSIM, an established individual-based simulation model, and previously published quantifications for the seven countries. We predicted changes in HIV deaths and new infections over the period 2025–2030 for four scenarios: (1) Executive order—proportional, where treatment disruption was proportional to the country-specific PEPFAR's share of total HIV funding; (2) Executive order—realistic, assuming near-total system collapse due to program dependencies; and (3–4) Waiver scenarios where treatment was resumed after 4 or after 8 weeks. Resumptions of programs accounted for delays due to organizational and logistical challenges.
Findings
A 90-day funding freeze would result in 60 thousand [95% UI: 49–71 thousand] excess HIV deaths for the Executive order—proportional scenario. This number would increase to 74 thousand excess HIV deaths [95% UI: 63–89 thousand] for the Executive order—realistic scenario. Under a 4-week and 8-week waiver scenario, projected excess HIV deaths ranged between 21 thousand [95% UI: 15–28 thousand] and 28 thousand [95% UI: 22–36 thousand] respectively. Excess new infections ranged between 35 and 103 thousand for the different scenarios.
Interpretation
The sudden cessation of PEPFAR funding likely results in tens of thousands of HIV deaths and new infections. These losses of life and health should compel the United States government to rapidly and fully re-instate one of the most successful health programs in history.
Funding
None."
LIU2023101239,The use of code glosses in three minute thesis presentations: A comprehensibility strategy,"The Three Minute Thesis (3MT) is an academic competition that challenges graduate students to explain their research in 3 minutes to a non-specialist audience. While there have been a few studies examining rhetorical moves and interactional metadiscourse in 3MT presentations, studies focusing on features related to comprehensibility, a key competition requirement, have been lacking. This study examines how highly-specialised research is made comprehensible to non-specialist audiences through “code glosses”, communication strategies that function to facilitate understanding by reformulating, explaining, or elaborating on what has been said (Hyland, 2005). Analysing a corpus of 50 successful 3MT presentations in the electrical and computer engineering discipline, we found code glosses to be one of the most frequently used interactive metadiscourse types in the data. Significantly, Analogies and Definitions emerged as salient-enough features in our data that we added them as additional categories of code gloss, extending Hyland's (2007) two categories of Exemplifiers and Reformulators. Our analysis shows how examples, definitions, analogies, and reformulations are used in distinct ways in 3MT presentations to make the presented research accessible, coherent, and engaging to audiences. Our findings expand current understandings of code glosses, and extend the current knowledge on the 3MT genre by providing insights into its distinctive linguistic features vis-à-vis comprehensibility."
RACHMATULLAH2020100018,Development and validation of the Computer Science Attitudes Scale for middle school students (MG-CS attitudes),"Primary and secondary students’ exposure to computer science-related activities in school has been steadily increasing, heightening the need for valid measures regarding impact of these activities on students. This study reports on the development and validation process of an instrument to measure students’ affective state as it relates to computer science in an academic setting. The self-report instrument, Computer Science Attitudes Scale for middle school students (MG-CS Attitudes), was developed based upon expectancy-value theory, which assumes two attitudinal constructs: self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. A set of ten initial items was administered to 663 middle-grade students from sixth to eighth grade (11–13 years of age). A combination of classical test theory and item response theory approaches were used to evaluate and validate the instrument using well-established construct validity frameworks to guide the process, leading to nine final items. The multi-stage validation process has resulted in a robust, well-functioning instrument, which can be used by researchers and evaluators to study CS-related educational interventions."
MAMOLO2022101014,Coding and climate change: Investigating prospective teachers’ pathways of attention,"This research is part of a broader research program that explores teacher educators’ mathematical knowledge. We examine the experiences, perceptions, and needs of prospective teachers as they navigate a complex set of new and interweaving ideas for how to teach mathematics with socially relevant and responsible connections. In doing so, we draw on Mason’s (1998) perspectives about the structure of attention and awareness for mathematics teaching, to investigate the pathways of attention of middle school prospective teachers in a technology-intensive undergraduate coding course. The research findings show that teachers face challenges when they try to navigate the interdisciplinary space of mathematics, technology and societal issues (climate change) and that curiosity acts as a potential stimulus for determining how each pathway is developed and sustained."
AGBO2024100385,A systematic literature review on software applications used to support curriculum development and delivery in primary and secondary education,"The evolution of educational software applications has revolutionised teaching and learning methodologies in primary and secondary education over the past decade. This paper conducts a review of primary studies based on N = 21 papers published between 2013 and 2023, focusing on the diverse landscape of software applications designed for student learning, curriculum development, delivery, and assessment. Findings from this study showcases a range of software solutions ranging from assessment tools to tutoring applications. Distinctive features supporting various aspects of teaching and learning, including lesson planning, delivery, management, assessment, and self-directed learning, were also identified. Regarding the features of software solutions used in primary and secondary schools, some differences were identified in terms of complexity, interactivity, assessment methodologies, and the collaborative functionalities of these tools. While highlighting the potential benefits, findings from this study also showed that challenges such as deployment costs, user self-efficacy, and technology anxiety are influential factors affecting the adoption of these technologies in primary and secondary educational settings. The evidence presented in this study serves as a resource for educational leaders and practitioners, facilitating a deeper understanding of available educational tools and essential considerations in the design and adoption of future tools."
GIANNAKOS2020100165,Mapping child–computer interaction research through co-word analysis,"This paper employs hierarchical clustering, strategic diagrams, and network analysis to construct an intellectual map of the Child–Computer Interaction research field (CCI) and to visualize the thematic landscape of this field using co-word analysis. This approach assumes that an article’s keywords constitute an adequate description of its content and reflect the topics that the article covers. It also assumes that the co-occurrence of two or more keywords within the same article indicates a linkage between those topics. This study quantifies the thematic landscape of the CCI field and elaborates on emerging topics as these are manifested in publications in the two primary venues of the CCI field, namely the proceedings of the annual IDC conference and the International Journal of CCI. Overall, a total of 1059 articles, and their respective 2445 unique, author-assigned keywords, are included in our analyses — all papers have been published between 2003 and 2018. The results indicate that the community has focused (i.e., high frequency keywords) in areas including Participatory Design, Tangibles, Design, Education, Coding, and Making. These areas also demonstrate a high degree of ”coreness” (i.e., connection with different topics) and ”constraint” (i.e., connection with otherwise isolated topics). The analysis also highlights well-structured yet peripheral topics, as well as topics that are either marginally interesting, or have the potential to become of major importance to the entire research network in the near future. Limitations of the approach and future work plans conclude the paper."
KIM2025105032,Unveiling teacher identity development: A case study of AI curriculum implementation in a rural middle school computer science class,"This study investigates how a CS teacher's professional identity develops during the implementation of an AI curriculum in a rural middle school. Addressing teachers' challenges with limited AI training, it focuses on identity dimensions of participation, self-categorization, and confidence. Data sources include classroom video observations and teacher interviews, analyzed using content analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

SCHAFER2024105962,"Executive functions and problem-solving—The contribution of inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility to science problem-solving performance in elementary school students","Previous research has shown that executive functions can contribute to successful problem-solving in preschool and elementary school children. However, most studies did not simultaneously assess the role of different specific aspects of executive functions. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the individual contribution of inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility to science problem-solving performance in elementary school children. A total of 478 children from first and second grades (Mage = 7.44 years) participated in our study. They performed a Go/No-go task (inhibition), a Corsi blocks backward task (working memory), a flexible item selection task (cognitive flexibility), and three science problem-solving tasks, including two gear turning tasks and one stabilization task. Structural equation modeling showed that working memory and cognitive flexibility individually contributed to problem-solving performance, whereas inhibition did not. We conclude that maintaining task requirements and dynamic object relations (working memory) and switching between different problem-solving phases (cognitive flexibility) are essential components of successful science problem-solving in elementary school children. Inhibitory processes may be more relevant in tasks involving a higher degree of interference at the task or response level."
TSAI2025105305,Effects of integrating self-regulation scaffolding supported by chatbot and online collaborative reflection on students’ learning in an artificial intelligence course,"Artificial intelligence (AI) includes complex concepts and could be difficult for non-computer or information students, and they may experience difficulties in an AI course. In order to develop students' AI skills, regulate their academic stress, and reduce student loneliness, the researchers in this study integrated self-regulation scaffolding (supported by a chatbot designed in this study) with online collaborative reflection, and investigated their effects on students' learning. The researchers conducted a quasi-experiment to explore the effects of self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection. The participants in this experiment were 116 undergraduates from three classes (groups) of a non-computer department taking a compulsory course titled ‘Introduction to Artificial Intelligence’. The experimental groups in this study included the first class (G1) simultaneously receiving the interventions of self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection, as well as the second class (G2) only receiving the intervention of self-regulation scaffolding. The last class (G3), that received a traditional teaching method (non-self-regulation scaffolding and non-online collaborative reflection) in an online AI course, served as the control group. According to the statistical analysis in this study, the self-regulation scaffolding approach in G2 significantly promoted participants' AI skills and fostered their ability to regulate academic stress compared to the control group. However, G1 students who received concurrent online collaborative reflection did not demonstrate the expected effects of enhancing their learning compared with those (G2) who did not receive it. This study represents an early attempt to implement self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection integrated with chatbot in an online AI course. The results of this study could serve as a reference for online course designers, educators, and scholars planning to adopt these teaching methods, especially for those focusing on implementing online AI education and educational technologies (such as chatBot)."
AIBINU2023100590,Solutions of fractional differential equations by using a blend of variational iteration method with Sumudu transform and application to price adjustment equations,"The presence of delays in a mathematical model can improve its vitality and suitability in describing several phenomena. However, in the presence of delays, nonlinear fractional differential equations are more difficult to study. This paper presents the use of a blend of variational iteration method with Sumudu transform for solving delay differential equations with Caputo derivatives of fractional variable order. Moreover, the paper introduces delays into the price adjustment equations to propose new price adjustment models with more potential for vitality and suitability. The paper assigns suitable real values to the parameters for the graphical display and comparison of the obtained solutions. The paper presents the interactions that exist among the price, demand, supply and dependence of supply and demand on the price, which can be applied to estimate the equilibrium price."
WU2024100295,"Analyzing K-12 AI education: A large language model study of classroom instruction on learning theories, pedagogy, tools, and AI literacy","There is growing recognition among researchers and stakeholders about the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on classroom instruction. As a crucial element in developing AI literacy, AI education in K-12 schools is increasingly gaining attention. However, most existing research on K-12 AI education relies on experiential methodologies and suffers from a lack of quantitative analysis based on extensive classroom data, hindering a comprehensive depiction of AI education's current state at these educational levels. To address this gap, this article employs the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create an intelligent analysis framework that identifies learning theories, pedagogical approaches, learning tools, and levels of AI literacy in AI classroom instruction. Compared with the results of manual analysis, analysis based on LLMs can achieve more than 90% consistency. Our findings, based on the analysis of 98 classroom instruction videos in central Chinese cities, reveal that current AI classroom instruction insufficiently foster AI literacy, with only 35.71% addressing higher-level skills such as evaluating and creating AI. AI ethics are even less commonly addressed, featured in just 5.1% of classroom instruction. We classified AI classroom instruction into three categories: conceptual (50%), heuristic (18.37%), and experimental (31.63%). Correlation analysis suggests a significant relationship between the adoption of pedagogical approaches and the development of advanced AI literacy. Specifically, integrating Project-based/Problem-based learning (PBL) with Collaborative learning appears effective in cultivating the capacity to evaluate and create AI."

In the study, explanatory mixed method design was used. As a quantitative data collection tool, the 21st century skills scale was utilized [47]. In addition to quantitative data, qualitative data were collected from the teachers and students through semi-structured interviews. Within the scope of the research, students participated in robotic design courses with Arduino over the learning management system for ten weeks and participated in a competition with their products at the end of the activity. The activity was held with the participation of 62 students and 10 teachers. The findings of the study showed that educational robotic activities caused a significant increase in the affective domain of the students. While it did not cause any significant increase in the cognitive and sociocultural domains, the average scores of students increased on post-tests compared to the pretests for these two domains. In addition, students’ 21st century skills did not differ according to gender. Although there is no statistically significant difference in pretest–posttest results due to grade level, an increase was observed in posttest averages at each grade level. The observed increase in the post-tests, although not statistical, reveals the positive effect of educational robotic coding in terms of students’ 21st century skills. To support the results of the quantitative data, the analysis of the qualitative data revealed a consensus of both teachers and students on the contribution of such applications to the advancement of contemporary skills. In conclusion, the results of this study show that educational robotic coding can be used to develop 21st century skills of elementary school students."
LIU2024104393,Exploring the influence of students' perceptions of face-to-face collaboration on cognitive engagement and learning outcomes in collaborative programming,"Collaborative programming is being increasingly used to overcome the difficulties of the individual programming process. In this study, we investigated the effect of collaborative perception on cognitive engagement and learning outcomes in collaborative programming. We used a quasi-experimental research to determine the differences in cognitive engagement and learning outcomes of three groups with different levels of collaborative perception. The findings highlight several important conclusions. First, there were significant differences in cognitive engagement and learning outcomes across collaborative perception groups. Students with high levels of collaborative perception demonstrate more comprehensive and diverse cognitive engagement, resulting in higher learning outcomes compared to those with lower perception. Second, students in the low collaborative perception group had more Clarification-Elaboration cognitive connections, and students in the high collaborative perception group had stronger Clarification-Positioning and Clarification-Verification cognitive connections. Third, collaborative perception positively moderated the relationship between cognitive engagement and learning outcomes. In particular, three cognitive engagement, Clarification, Elaboration, and Positioning, had a greater impact on performance when moderated by collaborative perceptions. These findings have practical implications for educators and course designers, emphasizing the importance of considering students' collaborative perception when forming groups and promoting effective collaborative programming."
YOUNIS2020687,"Survey of Robotics in Education, Taxonomy, Applications, and Platforms during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized as a disease caused by a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly known as 2019-nCoV). In December 2019, COVID-19 began to appear in a few countries. By the beginning of 2020, it had spread to most countries across the world. This is when education challenges began to arise. The COVID-19 crisis led to the closure of thousands of schools and universities all over the world. Such a situation requires reliance on e-learning and robotics education for students to continue their studies to avoid the mingling between people and students. In relation to this alternative learning solution, the present study was conducted. A systematic literature review on educational robotics (ER) keywords between 2015–2020 was carried out for the purpose to review a total of 2253 articles from the selected sources; Scopus (452), Taylor & Francis (311), Science Direct (427), IEEE Xplore (221), and Web of Science (842). This review procedure was labelled as Taxonomy 1. After filtering Taxonomy 1, it was found that 98 scientific articles formed the so-called Taxonomy II that was categorized into six categories: (i) Robotics concepts, (ii) Device, (iii) Robotic applications, (iv) Manufacturing robots, (v) Robotics analysis, and (vi) Education/taxonomy. For this study, only 35 articles in this specific field were selected, of which were then assigned into three categories: (i) Application, (ii) Platform, and (iii) Educational. The results show that the application category carries 17.4%, platform 20%, and education 22.85%. This study serves as the application platform to help students, academics, and researchers."
AZEKA2022e10517,Building a school data portal using open data: A description of the user research & development process,"The lack of relevant and disaggregated data about schools is a challenge for organizations implementing and funders looking to invest in kindergarten through 12th-grade education programs in New York City (NYC), often forcing organizations to make critical programmatic and financial decisions with only partial or anecdotal information about schools and its existing efforts. Over the last two years, an institution of higher education and a private foundation worked together to address this problem by indexing text in thousands of annual school reports and combining multiple open data sets about schools, including geography, demographics, and academic performance, into a single database. The initial use case focused on understanding the existing computing education efforts in NYC. However, seeing the potential to inform a broader set of questions, the collaborators began exploring the utility of such data with program officers at the foundation. Interviews of program officers around their programmatic needs and challenges illuminated their struggles with analyzing scattered data, difficulty accessing non-academic data and the need for disaggregated and geographical data. These findings are being used to inform the development of a data portal that interfaces with the aggregated dataset for foundations and others interested in data about schools."
PAPAGIANNOPOULOS2025100397,Cosmological phase-space analysis of f(G)-theories of gravity,"The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further f(G) contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit a priori the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe."
CHENG2023100171,Leading digital transformation and eliminating barriers for teachers to incorporate artificial intelligence in basic education in Hong Kong,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a transformative force across diverse sectors worldwide, with policy initiatives signalling its rising prominence. In the realm of education, AI holds promise for revolutionising learning and teaching. However, the incorporation of AI in basic education faces significant challenges for many schools, particularly when explicit curriculum guidelines are absent, and teachers have limited exposure to AI technologies. This study delves into the importance of integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), particularly in primary and secondary school settings, with a specific emphasis on the obstacles and facilitators. The research examines the impact of digital leadership and its role in mitigating teachers' barriers to AIED incorporations. These external variables are systematically outlined within the conceptual framework proposed by this study. Furthermore, it conceptualises and considers three AIED approaches—Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI—as internal variables central to basic-education AIED incorporations, as highlighted in previous research. The study gathers quantitative data through a self-constructed questionnaire survey from 204 school principals and management-level teachers across 60 primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, capturing their perceptions of AIED incorporation. A structural equation model (SEM) is adopted to analyse the relationships between digital leadership, internal and external teacher barriers, and the three AIED approaches. The findings underscore that digital leadership is a significant factor in facilitating AI incorporations in schools, and that teachers' internal and external barriers considerably affect Learning about AI. The paper concludes by proposing strategies to enhance the capabilities of school leaders and teachers in promoting AIED in basic education."
VOSKOGLOU202591,5 - Using gray numbers as tools for assessment and linear programming,"The gray system (GS) theory, introduced by Ju-Long Deng in 1982, is an alternative to the fuzzy systems' approach for managing the existing in real world uncertainties. Gray numbers (GNs), which are defined with the help of the closed real intervals, are the tools for performing all the necessary calculations in GS theory. This Chapter studies applications of GNs to assessment and to linear programming and presents examples illustrating their use in real world situations."
ZHOU2025100904,Exploring the development of pre-service teachers' epistemic agency in Chinese University knowledge building community,"Epistemic agency, the capacity to effectively engage with knowledge and understand its nature, is crucial for successful learning and problem-solving in today's complex world. This study explores the non-linear development of epistemic agency among pre-service teachers engaged in principle-based Knowledge Building (KB) activities on the Knowledge Forum (KF) platform within a Chinese university setting. By analyzing interaction data, notes, and reflective reports from 38 participants, the findings reveal a positive correlation between the development of epistemic agency and strategies for handling cognitive conflicts. The research highlights a transition from reliance on authoritative knowledge to confidence in personal KB, and from simplistic understanding of problems to critical thinking about complex issues. These insights provide empirical support for the design of teacher education curricula, emphasizing the importance of creating opportunities for pre-service teachers to manage cognitive conflicts, thereby fostering their growth in epistemic agency."
MALINVERNI2021100305,Educational Robotics as a boundary object: Towards a research agenda,"Educational robotics has become each time more present in the educational experiences of children and young people. Nonetheless, often, the way in which robotics is introduced in educational settings has been considered as unnecessarily narrow. The paper aims at widening the scope of Educational Robotics and expanding the pedagogical possibilities of this field. To this end, the paper draws on the outcomes of two case studies carried out with primary and secondary school children aimed at investigating their views about robots. These studies allow framing and identifying five themes we believe are particularly relevant to rethink the pedagogy of Educational Robotics. Using these themes as cornerstones for reflection, we delineate a set of dimensions and paths to move Educational Robotics beyond the focus on technical skills but instead explore its potential as a boundary object to involve children in reflective processes around the ethical, social and cultural implications of emerging intelligent technologies."

It enables board game design, creative code applications like photo and video mosaics, and visualizing complex concepts like image convolution. The design of the library ensures students engage with essential skills in functional and object-oriented programming, set and logical operations, geometric transformations, and game design. Illustrative examples demonstrate its main functionalities, and a preliminary evaluation highlights the potential for future quantitative research to assess its impact on learning outcomes."
LIN2020103944,Assessing learning in technology-rich maker activities: A systematic review of empirical research,"Maker activities are drawing increasing attention in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Researchers have developed various assessments for maker activities to examine students' learning outcomes. However, a systematic review of research on such assessments is lacking. To fill this gap, we reviewed empirical studies on maker-based assessments in education. We systematically examined 60 studies regarding the overall features of the maker activities, the learning outcomes that were measured, the assessment formats, and the psychometric evidence of the assessments. Our review results indicate that more than 20 types of maker platforms have been employed in the activities, with e-textiles and LilyPad Arduino being the most popular. Five types of assessment tools have been used prevalently to examine students' diverse learning outcomes, specifically artifact assessments, tests, surveys, interviews, and observations. Most assessments are used in STEM-related maker activities, especially technology-centric activities, to measure STEM-related learning outcomes. Only 15% of the studies provide psychometric evidence of reliability and validity for the assessments. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions for future research which include developing more low-tech maker activities for students in lower-grades and with lower technology proficiency. In addition, future studies should improve rubrics for artifact assessment and explore more assessment tools for non-STEM subjects."
CAO2023140,A data and knowledge-jointly driven multimodal intelligent system for enterprise culture assessment,"Based on the rapid development of Internet new generation information technology, campus culture has become an important force to promote educational innovation. However, the uneven quality of campus culture teaching is also increasingly exposed. Therefore, we propose a set of campus culture intelligent quality assessment feedback system driven by data and knowledge. Based on real multi-modal campus culture data, the evaluation system covers different online teaching forms, and can comprehensively consider and measure the core elements of quality evaluation from the perspective of teachers and students, so as to achieve accurate evaluation and feedback of campus culture. This paper proposes to combine emotion computing with big data analysis, construct a theoretical framework of multi-modal emotion analysis from the perspective of multi-spatial fusion, and explore the students' learning emotion recognition and intelligent assessment based on multi-modal data fusion. By studying the key issues, logical path and implementation path of multimodal learning emotion analysis in campus culture, this paper reveals the mechanism of student emotion development from the perspective of campus culture, expands the intervention practice of student group emotion, and provides technical support and action guidance for after-school teaching and research on campus culture."
SIGAYRET2022104505,Unplugged or plugged-in programming learning: A comparative experimental study,"In recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple ability to code. However, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students' performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact."

GOBL2023100604,Situating computational empowerment in formal education: A multi-perspective view,"Digital literacy and respective education are of growing interest in our increasingly digitalized world. Recent works stress the importance of aiming beyond the acquisition of corresponding technical competences and call for fostering children’s empowerment and participation in digitalization. Computational Empowerment (CE) pursues that goal through a creative and reflexive participatory design approach. However, remaining conceptual vagueness with regard to what CE entails may hinder its implementation in formal education. This paper addresses this gap, with the aim to demonstrate what is needed to advance CE’s position in this context. To this end, we elaborate on our understanding of CE’s vision, approach and impact. We then examine CE in the context of formal education, and contrast it with selected contemporary educational theory and practice. Specifically, we position CE in relation to an established learning framework (Bloom’s revised taxonomy), educational policy (DigComp) and practices in the classroom. This is complemented by an analysis of four different projects: we present lessons learned in the context of pedagogical interventions and take a closer look at the accompanying empowerment processes. As a result, this paper provides a foundation to make CE’s ideas more tangible and, thus, actionable, for researchers, policy makers and educators."
PHIPPEN2025125,Digital Literacy,"Digital literacy is a crucial skill set in the contemporary era, encompassing technical proficiency, information and media literacy, data literacy, and more. There are further disciplines that are incorporated into the broad concept of digital literacy, including cybersecurity, online safety, and responsible communication. The importance of critical thinking in digital contexts and the emerging field of digital wellbeing are addressed. There are challenges in achieving digital literacy including the lack of common frameworks and diverse barriers such as access to technology, affordability, and cultural differences. Ultimately digital literacy is something that requires the input of various stakeholders, including educators, governments, technology providers, and community organizations. There is a clear need for a collaborative, multi-pronged approach to address these challenges and the need for common agreement on what digital literacy is."
KONG2022104598,"High achievers’ attitudes, flow experience, programming intentions and perceived teacher support in primary school: A moderated mediation analysis","To improve programming performance for a larger student population, this study shed light on the commonalities of high achievers in programming classes. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated high achievers in primary school programming classes. This study adapted the hedonic-motivation system adoption model to identify high achievers' perceived attitudes, flow experience, programming intentions and perceived teacher support. With a response rate of 72%, 54 primary schools participated in the study. A survey was conducted and four hundred and thirty-two students were included in the moderated mediation analysis. The results showed that high achievers' attitudes towards programming positively related to their flow experience, which further positively associated with their programming intentions. In addition, teacher support moderated the relationship between high achievers’ attitudes and their flow experience; such that when teacher support increased, the flow experience was weaker for those with comparatively higher positive attitudes. The practical implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed."
HWU20231,Chapter 1 - Introduction,"This chapter introduces the book by first giving an account of the historic events that pushed heterogeneous parallel computing into the mainstream. It distinguishes between latency-oriented multicore CPUs and throughput oriented many-thread GPUs, the two main styles of computing devices in modern heterogeneous computing systems. The chapter then goes into the main reasons for applications to demand more speed and the Amdahl’s law, an important observation about the parallelization of real application. It then explains how the book addresses the main challenges in parallel algorithms and parallel programming and how the skills that have been learned from the book based on CUDA, the language of choice for programming examples, and exercises in this book can be generalized into other parallel programming interfaces. Finally, the chapter highlights the overarching goals for the book and the contents and rationales of the rest of the chapters."
WANG2024124167,Artificial intelligence in education: A systematic literature review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) in education (AIED) has evolved into a substantial body of literature with diverse perspectives. In this review paper, we seek insights into three critical questions: (1) What are the primary categories of AI applications explored in the education field? (2) What are the predominant research topics and their key findings? (3) What is the status of major research design elements, including guiding theories, methodologies, and research contexts? A bibliometric analysis of 2,223 research articles followed by a content analysis of selected 125 papers reveals a comprehensive conceptual structure of the existing literature.

Furthermore, this review highlights the diverse range of theories applied in the AIED literature, the multidisciplinary nature of publication venues, and underexplored research areas. In sum, this research offers valuable insights for interested scholars to comprehend the current state of AIED research and identify future research opportunities in this dynamic field."
KUMAR2024147,Chapter Eight - Machine learning model for teaching and emotional intelligence,"Education that is ongoing and permanent for the purpose of adaptable up-skilling and retraining has been identified as a contributory factor, along with a relentless race against time, fast scientific progress, and unanticipated challenges. Students in postsecondary learning require mechanisms that can enable long-term, dependable knowledge production and storage, and this is particularly true in the age after a pandemic that occurred during the development of new technologies. There has been an explosion of e-learning platforms and methodologies that have been developed to remedy this issue; however, not all of them have been as successful as would be ideal. This type of new knowledge is very difficult to execute properly; it needs complex, careful educational and interface design to perform as well as it does and keep learners interested. This framework was designed and developed in this study. This technology was employed to support a cutting-edge pedagogic study based on neuroscience that was offered to faculty at universities of higher education. This framework was designed and developed in this study. This technology was employed to support a cutting-edge pedagogic study based on neuroscience that was offered to faculty at universities of higher education. Having a high intelligence quotient does not guarantee a successful and happy life. Success also necessitates self-awareness and emotional control. Our idea was to create a computational paradigm that would educate students in both programming and emotional intelligence. This experiment was successful in addressing the problem of excessive screen use by providing a student interface without displays."
MATOS2025100571,A systematic review of artificial intelligence applications in education: Emerging trends and challenges,"The academic world is becoming increasingly interested in the applications of Artificial Intelligence technology in education. A systematic review examines AI applications in education, focusing on their effectiveness, challenges, and implications. A comprehensive analysis of studies published between 2011 and 2024 encompassed 45 research articles from major databases, such as PubMed Central, IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, Springer, MDPI, ACM, and PMC. The findings highlight the predominant use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT (30%), followed by other advanced technologies, such as GPT-4, machine learning, and virtual reality. Research across global regions, particularly in Canada (18%), the United States (12%), and China (8%), highlights the multifaceted applications of AI in enhancing personalized learning, fostering critical thinking, and supporting professional education. Tools such as ChatGPT have demonstrated strong performance in theoretical knowledge delivery and medical education, while augmented and virtual reality excels in practical skill development. Despite these advances, challenges such as data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and the need for specialized educator training remain critical."
YAP2022101825,Free and open source urbanism: Software for urban planning practice,"Free and open source tools present numerous opportunities to support current urban planning practice. However, their overview is fragmented, and the uptake among planning professionals remains lacklustre. Recent discourse in the domain of planning support tools attribute poor take up to the lack of understanding on the landscape and functionality of available tools, and how tools can add value to the planning process. We provide an understanding of the state of the art concerning open source tools for urban planning from journal articles, software repositories, and social media. Our search documented 70 open source tools that support different stages of the urban planning process. We cover an additional set of 54 peripheral tools to support domains related to urban planning. In the process, we formalise and describe the urban planning process and find that the entire planning process can be conducted using open source software. Tools focusing on street networks and geographic spatial analysis are the mainstay of current implementation. Sixty percent of tools are only accessible through an application programming interface, while 43% rely on Python for development. The scenario planning, public participation, and evaluation phases of the planning process present many untapped opportunities for open source software development. Findings will help urban planners and researchers to employ these tools for professional practice, and assist software developers to identify opportunities for software development in urban research."
HOOSHYAR2022116670,GameDKT: Deep knowledge tracing in educational games,"Despite the multiple deep knowledge tracing (DKT) methods developed for intelligent tutoring systems and online learning environments, there exists only a few applications of such methods in educational computer games. One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners’ knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy. Interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to RNN and LSTM in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners’ performance in game tasks."
SCHAPER2022100537,Computational empowerment in practice: Scaffolding teenagers’ learning about emerging technologies and their ethical and societal impact,"Whereas computational empowerment is well established in child–computer interaction research, less effort has been made to integrate this approach in practice. Building on four existing principles in child–computer interaction, namely Closeness, Embodied Learning, Design Process and Decoding, we explore how computational empowerment can be scaffolded in practice. This study was part of an interdisciplinary research project exploring emerging technologies in education (CEED). We involved 9 teachers and 26 students (14–15 y) in Denmark in teaching about machine learning and augmented reality. In the article we develop a framework for applying computational empowerment in formal educational contexts. Based on the study, we found that computational empowerment builds on distinct layers which are these four principles. Specifically, merging the principles Closeness and Embodied Learning can increase student engagement and motivation in the activities; in addition, Decoding and Design Process are key principles for promoting student awareness of the societal impacts of emerging technologies. Based on qualitative data from this intervention, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for child–computer interaction in moving toward computational empowerment in practice."

MCDONALD202239,Undergraduate structural biology education: A shift from users to developers of computation and simulation tools,"The use of theory and simulation in undergraduate education in biochemistry, molecular biology, and structural biology is now common, but the skills students need and the curriculum instructors have to train their students are evolving. The global pandemic and the immediate switch to remote instruction forced instructors to reconsider how they can use computation to teach concepts previously approached with other instructional methods. In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. We are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum."
BRADY2022101156,Block-based abstractions and expansive services to make advanced computing concepts accessible to novices,"Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. However, most offer only restricted access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other computers or accessing resources and data on the internet), the limited support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. We argue that it is feasible to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely-used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. The paper presents the architecture of and design decisions behind NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas. We show how NetsBlox expands opportunities for learning considerably: NetsBlox projects can access a wealth of online data and web services, and they can communicate with other projects. Moreover, the tool infrastructure enables young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction, whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. In this way, NetsBlox offers an illuminating example of how tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing."

LIU2023101339,Promoting primary school students’ creativity via reverse engineering pedagogy in robotics education,"Creativity is an essential basic skill for students. In this study, the reverse engineering pedagogy (REP) was applied to primary school students’ robotics education course, with the aim of investigating the influence of REP and project-based pedagogy (PBP) on the cultivation of students' creativity. A quasi-experimental study that utilized a non-equivalent groups design was conducted with 91 fifth-grade students, comprising a control group (n = 46) who received the PBP intervention, and an intervention group (n = 45) who received the REP intervention. Creative self-efficacy, Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking Figural (TTCT-Figural), and assessment of the students’ robotic creative products were conducted to evaluate students’ creativity. In addition, t tests, ANCOVA, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data to determine whether REP could improve students’ creativity better than PBP. The results showed that REP could enhance students’ creative self-efficacy and their robotic creative products score more than PBP could, but not the TTCT-Figural score after the confounding effect of fluency was controlled for. In the intervention group, creative self-efficacy and creative thinking were improved after intervention. Overall, REP has more advantages than PBP for promoting primary school students' creativity. The findings of this study provide a reference and teaching strategies guidance for the cultivation of K-12 students' creativity in robotics education."
SHARMA2022100536,Children’s facial expressions during collaborative coding: Objective versus subjective performances,"Educational research has used the information extracted from facial expressions to explain learning performance in various educational settings like collaborative learning. Leveraging this, we extracted the emotions based upon two different theoretical frameworks from videos with children aged 13–16 while collaborating to create games using Scratch. The two sets of emotions are based on the control value theory (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise) and the education-specific expressions (frustration, boredom, confusion, delight). We computed the groups’ objective performance, which was calculated based on their created artifacts. We divided them into high and low performance and compared them based on individual emotions’ duration and the transitions among the emotions. We also used the subjective indication of their perceived performance from a self-reported questionnaire, divided them into another performance category, and did a similar analysis with the objective performance. Results show that the objective performance is better explained by the education-specific emotions and the negative valance emotions from the control value theory-based emotions. On the other hand, subjective performance is better explained by the control value theory based on emotions. Based on the results, we suggest implications both for the instructors and students."
CAI2022102180,The fluid relation between reading strategies and mathematics learning: A perspective of the Island Ridge Curve,"Mathematics learning is not only determined by mathematical contents, but also by reading strategies that students apply to comprehend the mathematical tasks. Although studies in mathematics education have shown that reading strategies are positively related to mathematics learning, the relation may not be linear as widely believed. Recent research in language assessment has found that the association between reading strategies and reading performance fluctuates as language proficiency increases, a pattern metaphorically called the Island Ridge Curve (IRC). Inspired by the IRC, we hypothesize that the relation between reading strategies and mathematics learning also fluctuates in the pattern of the IRC as students' reading proficiency increases. To verify this assumption, we used a public dataset of 529,091 15-year-old students (M = 15.79, SD = 0.29) from 77 countries/territories. Results of multilevel mixture regression analysis indicated that reading strategies (in our case, understanding and memorizing strategies) are related to mathematics learning through reading proficiency and this relation fluctuates like the IRC. Implications for applying IRC to reading strategies instruction in mathematics education are discussed. (170 words)."
RAINER2024309,Development of “Peter's First-Aid Adventure” Virtual Reality-Based Serious Game in First-Aid Education: Usability Analysis of Virtual Reality Interaction Tools,"Incidents that threaten lives can occur unexpectedly, highlighting the importance of immediate first aid. Studies show that Virtual Reality (VR)-based Serious Games (SG) are excellent alternatives for learning, especially for physical training, as they provide immersive and realistic scenarios where users can learn and practice their skills in a safe environment. Therefore, this research proposes the design of a VR-based SG for learning first aid procedures. A total of 31 participants tested the game's usability using both VR controllers and hand tracking, playing the game with both tools in random order, and then completing the XR-GUQ and Interaction Categories questionnaire. The results indicate that controllers offer higher usability than hand tracking. However, the game can still effectively utilize both interaction tools, given their satisfactory usability ratings."

AYANWALE2024100330,Navigating the future: Exploring in-service teachers' preparedness for artificial intelligence integration into South African schools,"This study contributes to existing research on how to integrate Artificial intelligence (AI) into school systems globally. This research explores in-service teachers' preparedness for integrating artificial intelligence into schools. We conducted this research within the context of the South African school system with teachers of various specializations, including sciences, social Sciences, mathematics, and languages. Drawing on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), we gathered teachers' perspectives through eight variables of technology integration, social influence, AI ethics, attitudes, TPACK, perceived self-efficacy, AI professional development, and AI preparedness. To analyze the 430 teachers' data involved in this study, we used a structural equation modeling analytical approach with SmartPLS software version 4.1.0.0. Our results indicate that technology integration, social influence, attitudes, and perceived self-efficacy influence teachers’ preparedness for AI. However, TPACK and ethics do not influence preparing teachers to integrate AI into schools. This study further presents interesting insight based on the mediation and moderation analysis of the variables. We discuss our findings and highlight their implications for practice and policy."
DASSAYE2024,"SARS-CoV-2 Infections in a Triad of Primary School Learners (Grades 1-7), Their Parents, and Teachers in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Protocol for a Cross-Sectional and Nested Case-Cohort Study","Background
In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa, there is paucity of data on SARS-CoV-2 infections among children attending school, including seroprevalence and transmission dynamics.
Objective
This pilot study aims to assess (1) the prevalence of self-reported or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 prior infections, COVID-19 symptoms (including long COVID), seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and general/mental health, (2) longitudinal changes in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 acute infections, immune responses, transmission dynamics, and symptomatic versus asymptomatic contacts in a unique cohort of unvaccinated primary school learners, their parents, teachers, and close contacts in semirural primary school settings.
Methods
Learners (grades 1-7) from primary schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, their parents, and teachers will be invited to enroll into the COVID kids school study (CoKiDSS). CoKiDSS comprises 3 parts: a cross-sectional survey (N=640), a follow-up survey (n=300), and a nested case-cohort substudy. Finger-prick blood and saliva samples will be collected for serological and future testing, respectively, in the cross-sectional (451 learners:147 parents:42 teachers) and follow-up (210 learners:70 parents:20 teachers) surveys. The nested case-cohort substudy will include cases from the cross-sectional survey with confirmed current SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=30) and their close contacts (n=up to 10 per infected participant). Finger-prick blood (from all substudy participants), venous blood (from cases), and nasal swabs (from cases and contacts) will be collected for serological testing, immunological testing, and viral genome sequencing, respectively. Questionnaires covering sociodemographic and general and mental health information, prior and current SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and testing information, vaccination status, preventative behavior, and lifestyle will be administered. Statistical methods will include generalized linear mixed models, intracluster correlation, descriptive analysis, and graphical techniques.
Results
A total of 645 participants were enrolled into the cross-sectional survey between May and August 2023. A subset of 300 participants were followed up in the follow-up survey in October 2023. Screening of the participants into the nested case-cohort substudy is planned between November 2023 and September 2024. Data cleanup and analysis for the cross-sectional survey is complete, while those for the follow-up survey and nested case substudy will be completed by the third quarter of 2024. The dissemination and publication of results is anticipated for the fourth quarter of 2024.
Conclusions
This study provides data from an LMIC setting on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on school-attending learners, their parents, and teachers 3 years after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was declared and 21-24 months after resumption of normal school attendance. In particular, this study will provide data on the prevalence of self-reported or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 prior infection, prior and current symptoms, seroprevalence, changes in seroprevalence, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immune responses, and symptoms of long COVID and mental health among a triad of learners, their parents, and teachers.

OLADEJO2024495,Chapter 36 - Tuning SVMs' hyperparameters using the whale optimization algorithm,"In the literature, metaheuristics are proposed as alternatives to traditional techniques such as grid search, gradient descent, randomized search, and experimental methods in tuning the hyperparameters of Machine Learning (ML) models. Metaheuristics have fast convergence times, flexibility, robustness, local optima avoidance, and intelligence. The performance of ML models is highly dependent on choosing optimal hyperparameters. This chapter explores the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and five of its selected improvement capabilities in optimally tuning the hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVMs are margin-based ML classifiers and are popular owing to their simplicity, high generalization, and accuracy. SVMs' hyperparameter tuning is analyzed with seven standard datasets, including Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Iris, MNIST, Wine Recognition, Glass Identification, Cars Evaluation, and Indian Liver Patients."
LI20241059,Evaluation of teaching effect of online education courses based on random forest,"At present, online education platforms are very popular. However, these platforms also have some drawbacks, including that they cannot be completely based on the needs of students, many students ignore the needs of students in order to adapt to the platform, do not adopt a more personalized learning style, and do not fully realize the individualized teaching. There are many factors at play, such as shifts in learning and teaching patterns, online platforms, hardware limitations of the network, and more. However, whether this model can finally satisfy teachers and students, and how the teaching effect is, has become a problem of concern. We propose a random forest-based method to evaluate college online courses. This method not only focuses on a single influencing factor, but also takes into account the special needs of students and teachers, and formulates different evaluation criteria, so that the system has not only universal applicability. The experimental results show that this method can improve the proficiency and level of teachers' online teaching, and can effectively combine several courses taught by students to form a personalized teaching method."
YANG2022100061,"Artificial Intelligence education for young children: Why, what, and how in curriculum design and implementation","Artificial intelligence (AI) education has posed fundamental challenges to early childhood education (ECE), including (1) why AI is necessary and appropriate for learning in the early years, (2) what is the subset of key AI ideas and concepts that can be learned by children, and (3) how to engage children in a meaningful experience that allows them to acquire these fundamental AI concepts. This report from the ECE field discusses the key considerations for developing an AI curriculum for young children. These key considerations altogether present an innovative pedagogical model for AI literacy education in early childhood. This model argues that AI literacy is an organic part of digital literacy for all citizens in an increasingly intelligent society. The core AI knowledge that can be explored with young children is: Using large amounts of data input, AI algorithms can be continuously trained to identify patterns, make predictions, and recommend actions, even though with limitations. Based on the theoretical notions of learning-by-making and pedagogy-as-relational, an embodied, culturally responsive approach should be used to enable young children's exploration with AI technologies. Finally, an exemplary curriculum named “AI for Kids” is introduced to demonstrate this pedagogical model and explain how educators can provide children culturally responsive inquiry opportunities to interact with and understand AI technologies. The synthesis of knowledge regarding “Why”, “What”, and “How” to do with AI education for young children informs a new way to engage children in STEM and understanding the digital world."
NG2021100041,Conceptualizing AI literacy: An exploratory review,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has spread across industries (e.g., business, science, art, education) to enhance user experience, improve work efficiency, and create many future job opportunities. However, public understanding of AI technologies and how to define AI literacy is under-explored. This vision poses upcoming challenges for our next generation to learn about AI. On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept “AI literacy”, in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate AI literacy. Grounded in literature on 30 existing peer-reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e., know and understand, use and apply, evaluate and create, and ethical issues) for fostering AI literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies. This study sheds light on the consolidated definition, teaching, and ethical concerns on AI literacy, establishing the groundwork for future research such as competency development and assessment criteria on AI literacy."
HELVACIOZACAR2023100560,Centering and decentering children in computing through joint activity at a computational science exhibit,"In this paper, we offer an investigation of the nuances of adult–child interactions at a computational science exhibit in a Canadian science museum. The theoretical lens of joint activity allows us to understand learning to code as a collaborative, intergenerational activity distributed between learners, educators, exhibit hardware, and the computer code itself. Specifically, we attend to the ways in which children can be centered at the computational science exhibit (moments in which their goals, histories, and desires are driving the exhibit’s interaction) by the actions of parents and museum facilitators or be decentered by them. Through qualitative analysis of video-recorded interactions of adults and children at the exhibit, we present categories of centering or decentering interactions while preserving the nuance and ambiguity involved in sociocultural contexts of learning. We also highlight two cases that illustrate the complexity and heterogeneity involved in facilitating a computational science exhibit. We close with a discussion and a call to eschew technocentric views of computing education that focus solely on device-level engagement and instead attend to the complex human–human interactions involved in computing education."
RUSMANA2021197,The Genetics Conceptual Understanding of Indonesian and United States Undergraduate Biology Students,"Genetics as a core concept of life science is essential for understanding biology. Examining genetics understanding among biology majors is becoming important since they must necessarily achieve some level of genetics understanding to advance their career. This study compares Indonesian biology majors’ genetics understanding with previously published data from students in the United States (US). This study also identifies the effect of academic year and program on genetics understanding by administering the Genetics Concept Assessment (GCA) to 377 biology majors in Indonesia. IRT-Rasch modeling was performed for instrument validation, followed by one-way ANOVA and independent sample t-test for the analysis. The results showed that Indonesian biology majors’ genetics understanding was significantly affected by academic year but was not affected by the academic program. Indonesian biology majors had a slightly similar level of genetics understanding with US non-majors’ pre-test scores, while Indonesian biology majors’ scores were two times lower than US majors’ post-test scores. The implications of reducing the gap between two countries are discussed."
RICHARDSON2022880,"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron triggers cross-reactive neutralization and Fc effector functions in previously vaccinated, but not unvaccinated, individuals","Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccines or infection. However, whether Omicron triggers cross-reactive humoral responses to other variants of concern (VOCs) remains unknown. We used plasma from 20 unvaccinated and 7 vaccinated individuals infected by Omicron BA.1 to test binding, Fc effector function, and neutralization against VOCs. In unvaccinated individuals, Fc effector function and binding antibodies targeted Omicron and other VOCs at comparable levels. However, Omicron BA.1-triggered neutralization was not extensively cross-reactive for VOCs (14- to 31-fold titer reduction), and we observed 4-fold decreased titers against Omicron BA.2. In contrast, vaccination followed by breakthrough Omicron infection associated with improved cross-neutralization of VOCs with titers exceeding 1:2,100. This has important implications for the vulnerability of unvaccinated Omicron-infected individuals to reinfection by circulating and emerging VOCs. Although Omicron-based immunogens might be adequate boosters, they are unlikely to be superior to existing vaccines for priming in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals."
YANG2021,Medical Data Mining Course Development in Postgraduate Medical Education: Web-Based Survey and Case Study,"Background
Medical postgraduates’ demand for data capabilities is growing, as biomedical research becomes more data driven, integrative, and computational. In the context of the application of big data in health and medicine, the integration of data mining skills into postgraduate medical education becomes important.
Objective
This study aimed to demonstrate the design and implementation of a medical data mining course for medical postgraduates with diverse backgrounds in a medical school.
Methods
We developed a medical data mining course called “Practical Techniques of Medical Data Mining” for postgraduate medical education and taught the course online at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). To identify the background knowledge, programming skills, and expectations of targeted learners, we conducted a web-based questionnaire survey. After determining the instructional methods to be used in the course, three technical platforms—Rain Classroom, Tencent Meeting, and WeChat—were chosen for online teaching. A medical data mining platform called Medical Data Mining - R Programming Hub (MedHub) was developed for self-learning, which could support the development and comprehensive testing of data mining algorithms. Finally, we carried out a postcourse survey and a case study to demonstrate that our online course could accommodate a diverse group of medical students with a wide range of academic backgrounds and programming experience.
Results
In total, 200 postgraduates from 30 disciplines participated in the precourse survey. Based on the analysis of students’ characteristics and expectations, we designed an optimized course structured into nine logical teaching units (one 4-hour unit per week for 9 weeks). The course covered basic knowledge of R programming, machine learning models, clinical data mining, and omics data mining, among other topics, as well as diversified health care analysis scenarios. Finally, this 9-week course was successfully implemented in an online format from May to July in the spring semester of 2020 at PUMC. A total of 6 faculty members and 317 students participated in the course. Postcourse survey data showed that our course was considered to be very practical (83/83, 100% indicated “very positive” or “positive”), and MedHub received the best feedback, both in function (80/83, 96% chose “satisfied”) and teaching effect (80/83, 96% chose “satisfied”). The case study showed that our course was able to fill the gap between student expectations and learning outcomes.
Conclusions
We developed content for a data mining course, with online instructional methods to accommodate the diversified characteristics of students. Our optimized course could improve the data mining skills of medical students with a wide range of academic backgrounds and programming experience."
MILLER2020181,Chapter eight - Data science and the exposome,"Data science is focused on extracting meaningful value from complex datasets. Exposome-related data are certainly complex with information coming from a myriad of sources. The huge amounts of data must be organized in some manner that allows appropriate interpretations and associations to be drawn. It is unlikely that unsupervised approaches will allow for causal associations to be made, but with proper study design and appropriate statistical and computational models, it should be possible to derive meaningful connections between complex exposures and specific health outcomes. The complex types of data will undoubtedly require sophistical mathematical approaches, including bioinformatics, computational, machine learning, and systems biology-based techniques. This chapter reviews some of the possible strategies that can be used to keep track of the diverse and massive datasets that will result from exposome research."

This article explores SSI in the landscape of parallel educational reform movements, the goals of STEM education, and how SSI can provide an avenue for attaining what are often viewed as disparate goals. The article concludes by highlighting challenges to SSI implementation found in the literature and outlining potential avenues to foster and support SSI implementation in STEM through teacher education and professional development."
GARDNER202451,Chapter 3 - Designing and prototyping smarter urban spaces,This chapter outlines how the concept of the smart city is explored and challenged in an undergraduate design course that adopts a cross-scale framework to design and prototype urban technology projects. It sets out an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to urban technology design that combines context-oriented spatial design methods with physical computing and interaction principles. It construes the design and prototyping of urban technology projects as sociotechnical thought experiments that can materialize ethical concerns and explore alternate ways that urban life can be lived with technology. The chapter concludes by outlining the themes that organize selected existing and speculative urban technology projects in the following chapters of the book.
HARRIS2023101038,Spatial visualization and measurement of area: A case study in spatialized mathematics instruction,"The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of spatial visualization skills when students solve area tasks. Spatial visualization is closely related to mathematics achievement, but little is known about how these skills link to task success. We examined middle school students’ representations and solutions to area problems (both non-metric and metric) through qualitative and quantitative task analysis. Task solutions were analyzed as a function of spatial visualization skills and links were made between student solutions on tasks with different goals (i.e., non-metric and metric). Findings suggest that strong spatial visualizers solved the tasks with relative ease, with evidence for conceptual and procedural understanding. By contrast, Low and Average Spatial students more frequently produced errors due to failure to correctly determine linear measurements or apply appropriate formula, despite adequate procedural knowledge. A novel finding was the facilitating role of spatial skills in the link between metric task representation and success in determining a solution. From a teaching and learning perspective, these results highlight the need to connect emergent spatial skills with mathematical content and support students to develop conceptual understanding in parallel with procedural competence."
ALHUMAID2025,Factors Determining Acceptance of Internet of Things in Medical Education: Mixed Methods Study,"Background
The global increase in the Internet of Things (IoT) adoption has sparked interest in its application within the educational sector, particularly in colleges and universities. Previous studies have often focused on individual attitudes toward IoT without considering a multiperspective approach and have overlooked the impact of IoT on the technology acceptance model outside the educational domain.
Objective
This study aims to bridge the research gap by investigating the factors influencing IoT adoption in educational settings, thereby enhancing the understanding of collaborative learning through technology. It seeks to elucidate how IoT can facilitate learning processes and technology acceptance among college and university students in the United Arab Emirates.
Methods
A questionnaire was distributed to students across various colleges and universities in the United Arab Emirates, garnering 463 participants. The data collected were analyzed using a hybrid approach that integrates structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN), along with importance-performance map analysis to evaluate the significance and performance of each factor affecting IoT adoption.
Results
The study, involving 463 participants, identifies 2 primary levels at which factors influence the intention to adopt IoT technologies. Initial influences include technology optimism (TOP), innovation, and learning motivation, crucial for application engagement. Advanced influences stem from technology acceptance model constructs, particularly perceived ease of use (PE) and perceived usefulness (PU), which directly enhance adoption intentions. Detailed statistical analysis using partial least squares–SEM reveals significant relationships: TOP and innovativeness impact PE (β=.412, P=.04; β=.608, P=.002, respectively), and PU significantly influences TOP (β=.381, P=.04), innovativeness (β=.557, P=.003), and learning motivation (β=.752, P<.001). These results support our hypotheses (H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5). Further, the intention to use IoT is significantly affected by PE and usefulness (β=.619, P<.001; β=.598, P<.001, respectively). ANN modeling enhances these findings, showing superior predictive power (R2=89.7%) compared to partial least squares–SEM (R2=86.3%), indicating a more effective identification of nonlinear associations. Importance-performance map analysis corroborates these results, demonstrating the importance and performance of PU as most critical, followed by technology innovativeness and optimism, in shaping behavioral intentions to use IoT.
Conclusions
This research contributes methodologically by leveraging deep ANN architecture to explore nonlinear relationships among factors influencing IoT adoption in education. The study underscores the importance of both intrinsic motivational factors and perceived technological attributes in fostering IoT adoption, offering insights for educational institutions considering IoT integration into their learning environments."
LAAKSO2021104308,Developing students’ digital competences through collaborative game design,"Background
This exploratory study engaged teams of elementary and middle school students in the collaborative design of digital games. Game design is theoretically examined in this study as a form of knowledge-creating learning that is characterized by collaborative efforts to advance a shared object of activity, i.e., the game being designed. Using mixed methods, we examined how students experienced the game design project and how the project fostered connected learning, that is, integration of students’ personal interests and supportive peer relations with their schoolwork, and how their self-assessed digital competences developed.
Methods
The digital competences of 98 comprehensive school students across Finland were traced using pre- and post-questionnaires. The post-questionnaire also included validated measures on connected learning. Quantitative methods were used to analyze structured measures, and qualitative methods were used to analyze open-ended measures.
Findings
Students experienced game design as an inspiring, challenging activity. Game design engaged student teams in sustained, collaborative efforts to create shared digital artifacts. Their efforts involved a great deal of mutual support and knowledge sharing. Participation also improved students’ self-reported technical and artistic digital competences. The game design project fostered informal, interest-driven, sociodigital participation; inspired learning engagement; and improved schoolwork practices.
Contribution
The game design project appeared to be a pedagogically meaningful way of engaging students in knowledge-creating learning and of connecting students' formal and informal learning. The project sparked students’ motivation to learn, fostered digital competences, and enriched the learning environment."
TSENG2025106570,Exploring artificial intelligence literacy and the use of ChatGPT and copilot in instruction on nursing academic report writing,"Background
Nursing education increasingly emphasizes academic writing and communication, critical for delivering quality patient care and professional advancement. Rapidly emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot are transforming educational methodologies, and a focus is being placed on embedding AI literacy to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. These technologies have the potential to reshape nursing education in a technology-driven health-care landscape.
Aim
This study investigated the effectiveness of AI literacy and the application of ChatGPT and Copilot in academic nursing report writing. It assessed the level of AI literacy of nursing students, examined the integration of basic AI concepts into a curriculum, and analyzed the impact of these tools compared with traditional teaching methods.
Methods
The study adopted a sample of 203 senior nursing students from Southern Taiwan to compare an AI-enhanced teaching approach using ChatGPT and Copilot with conventional methods. The curriculum, centered on the “Writing Case Reports and Seminars” course, employed the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate model and incorporated scaffolding techniques to synergistically integrate clinical skills with academic learning. AI literacy was measured using the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS). Summative assessments, adhering to the Taiwan Nursing Association standards, focused on individual and group case report evaluations.
Findings
Following an 18-week AI intervention, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in all dimensions of the MAILS. A ChatGPT usage of 100 % was found, with a notable enhancement discovered in the “Nursing Plan” section of case reports. Although the experimental group outperformed the control group in overall case report evaluations, the connections between identified problems and proposed plans were weaker and nursing interventions tended to be less individualized for the experimental group.
Conclusions
The incorporation of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot into a scaffolding teaching framework significantly boosted students' AI literacy and performance in summative assessments. Effective AI training for students, supervised use of these tools, and continuous professional development for educators are paramount to successful implementation. Addressing the current limitations of AI has the potential to further improve academic writing, foster critical thinking, and ensure responsible application in patient care, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more effective nursing education."

MILARA2020100197,STEAM in Oulu: Scaffolding the development of a Community of Practice for local educators around STEAM and digital fabrication,"There is an increased interest to integrate STEAM methodologies and digital fabrication processes into formal education. However, teachers have repeatedly reported a set of impediments that hampers them to succeed. This integration requires a set of changes in the school organization, resourcing and a proper teacher training. A Community of Practice formed by different stakeholders of a local educational community might provide the necessary grounds to lead to this transition. In this paper, we report our experience of creating and scaffolding a local Community of Practice for a period of ten months. We present the different activities we carried out during this period, emphasizing a digital fabrication training that we conducted, at our university Fab Lab premises, for teachers and school principals separately. We also explore the influence of this training on scaffolding of the development of the Community of Practice. We expect the training structure, discussion and insights presented in this paper would inspire other researchers and practitioners trying to bring digital fabrication to formal education."
MOGHADDAMMOGHADDAM2020367,Exploring lesson study in postsecondary education through self-study,"Purpose
The purpose of this collaborative self-study inquiry was to enhance the professional practice of faculty members through the adoption of lesson study. A seven-member faculty of education self-study group engaged in lesson study in a computer and learning resources for primary/elementary teachers’ course with teacher candidates.
Design/methodology/approach
This study focused on providing teacher candidates with increased opportunities for action and expression during in-class instruction. This collaborative lesson study inquiry (Fernandez et al., 2003; Fernandez and Yoshida, 2004; Murata, 2011) involved the four-step process of planning, doing, checking and acting (PDCA) (Cheng, 2019). Several data collection methods were adopted and data sources analyzed.
Findings
Challenges the group encountered during the study included ascertaining the goals of lesson study and offering critical feedback to each other. While this made decision-making more intricate and intentional, there was exceptional value in participating in the lesson study process. The results revealed three overarching themes: 1) challenges in classroom observations; 2) hesitation in providing supportive feedback to colleagues and 3) deliberations regarding what constitutes expertise within subject-specific preservice teacher education.
Originality/value
While lesson study has been adopted fairly extensively in K-12 settings, its adoption in postsecondary education is limited (Chenault, 2017). Considering the merits of lesson study for K-12 practitioners, this research investigated the similar advantages that lesson study might have for postsecondary education faculty, students and programs."
CLARKEMIDURA2021100250,How young children engage in and shift between reference frames when playing with coding toys,"This research explores reference frames and reference frame shifts among young children (ages 5 and 6) as they are learning to program with a commercial coding toy. To date, little is known about reference frames used by young children in toy-based coding. Video recordings of 16 children engaging in two programming tasks were collected. Results from an analysis of 240 min of video data indicate that young children engage in shifts of reference frames when learning to program, however, young children do not have a precise coordination system. The present study proposes two additional reference frames, ProtoEgocentric and ProtoAllocentric, that allow for the consideration of developmental imprecision in children. The most common reference frame shift observed was ProtoAllocentric to ProtoEgocentric, which accounted for 47.4% of all shifts across sites and contexts. Three cases are presented to illustrate reference frame shifts and how children’s developmental imprecision affects their experience."
MILLANO2024101589,Dynamics of a higher-dimensional Einstein–Scalar–Gauss–Bonnet cosmology,"We study the dynamics of the field equations in a five-dimensional spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric in the context of a Gauss–Bonnet–Scalar field theory where the quintessence scalar field is coupled to the Gauss–Bonnet scalar. Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet theory, where the Gauss–Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein–Scalar–Gauss–Bonnet model, the Gauss–Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe’s early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate."
SANTOS2024e41257,School Maker Environments: a systematic review of makerspaces in K-12 education,"Studies on maker practices as new learning strategies in basic education increased significantly in the last decade, indicating the need for a state-of-the-art survey. This systematic literature review analyzes implementing makerspaces in basic education schools. A search was carried out in databases on the literature referring to the theme between 2014 and 2023. A formal research protocol collected 602 articles. After using exclusions criteria, 123 proceeded to a detailed analysis. This investigation allowed answering the following research questions: How are makerspaces implemented and used in schools? Under what pedagogical aspects are maker practices justified and developed in Basic Education? Results indicate that most mapped works address issues related to maker practices at school and active learning methodologies. Current studies show proposals or exemplify actions with students, broadening the debate on the effectiveness and limitations of maker activities in the school environment. Noteworthy is the importance of teacher training for a better understanding of Maker Education and a greater affinity for using manual, electrical, and digital tools. The social role of the school makerspace as an environment that promotes inclusion, accessibility, diversity, equity, identity, and empowerment is an emerging theme that requires attention. However, there needs to be more information regarding the management and transformation of school spaces to adequately and safely shelter maker practices, coherently connecting the principles of the maker movement to educational ones, indicating that there is still a vast area of research on this subject."
MOUZA2022104530,Investigating the impact of research-based professional development on teacher learning and classroom practice: Findings from computer science education,"As the field of computer science (CS) is gaining increased attention, the need for qualified teachers is rapidly growing. Yet little is still known about the design features, implementation, and outcomes of professional development programs in computing. The purpose of this study is threefold: (a) examine a CS professional development program built around high-quality design features reported in the research literature, (b) investigate the impact of the program on participating teachers’ learning and classroom practice, and (c) identify specific design features that facilitated changes in teacher learning and practice. The study employed a mixed-methods design. Data were collected from multiple sources including, pre and post survey data on teacher knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology (N = 94), as well as interviews and classroom implementation data from eight case study participants. Findings from this work indicated that participants reported improvements in their knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology. They also applied new learning into their practice, though implementation varied among participants. Responding on the value of the professional development design features, teachers noted the importance of focusing on CS content knowledge as well as opportunities to engage with pedagogical practices for teaching computing. Findings also indicated the important role of contextualized follow-up classroom support in the implementation of new learning into practice. These findings have implications for the design of professional development programs grounded in best practices with the potential to support broad efforts intended to prepare teachers with the knowledge and skills needed to deliver CS education."
ARKAN2025106765,"The impact of ChatGPT training in the nursing process on nursing students' problem-solving skills, attitudes towards artificial intelligence, competency, and satisfaction levels: Single-blind randomized controlled study","Aim
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of training on the use of ChatGPT in the nursing process on nursing undergraduate students' problem-solving skills, attitudes towards artificial intelligence, competencies related to the nursing process, and satisfaction levels.
Design
Single blind randomized controlled study.
Methods
The sample of the study consisted of 48 experimental and 48 control groups, totaling 96 nursing students. The intervention group received the “Artificial Intelligence Integrated Nursing Process” training program. The control group only received the standard nursing process education. The data collection instruments were administered before the training and after the training. Chi-square analysis was used to compare variables, independent samples t-tests were used for comparisons between groups, and paired t-tests were used for within-group comparisons.
Results
In the post-education measurements, students in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly lower average total problem solving inventory score compared to those in the control group, indicating an improvement in problem-solving skills. The intervention group showed an increase in positive attitudes towards artificial intelligence compared to the control group and a decrease in negative attitudes. In the intervention group, students showed a significant increase in their nursing process competency levels and satisfaction levels after the training, whereas no significant change was observed in the control group.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the training provided on the use of ChatGPT in the nursing process positively impacted nursing students' problem-solving skills, attitudes towards artificial intelligence, competencies related to the nursing process, and levels of satisfaction."
MAHOMED2023e230,"Safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of neutralising monoclonal antibody CAP256V2LS administered with and without VRC07-523LS in HIV-negative women in South Africa (CAPRISA 012B): a phase 1, dose-escalation, randomised controlled trial","Summary
Background
Young women in sub-Saharan Africa continue to bear a high burden of HIV infection. Combination anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies are a potential HIV prevention technology that could overcome adherence challenges of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis. In this phase 1 clinical trial we aimed to determine the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of the broadly neutralising monoclonal antibody CAP256V2LS.
Methods
CAPRISA 012B, a first-in-human dose-escalation phase 1 trial evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and neutralisation activity of CAP256V2LS alone and in combination with VRC07-523LS in young HIV-negative women in Durban, South Africa. Groups 1 and 2 were open label with CAP256V2LS administered at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg intravenously and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg subcutaneously. In group 3, participants were randomly allocated to receive a combination of CAP256V2LS and VRC07-523LS at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg subcutaneously comixed with ENHANZE, a recombinant human hyaluronidase. Once safety was established in the first three participants, dose escalation took place sequentially following review of safety data. Primary endpoints were the proportion of participants with mild, moderate, and severe reactogenicity or adverse events, graded as per the Division of AIDS toxicity grading. The trial is registered on the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, PACTR202003767867253, and is recruiting.
Findings
From July 13, 2020, to Jan 13, 2021, 42 HIV-negative women, aged 18–45 years, were enrolled. All 42 participants, eight with intravenous and 34 with subcutaneous administration, completed the trial. There were no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. Most commonly reported symptoms following intravenous administration were headaches in seven (88%) and nausea in four (50%) participants. Commonly reported symptoms following subcutaneous administration were headache in 31 (91%), chills in 25 (74%), and malaise or fatigue in 19 (56%) participants. Adverse events included transient lymphocytopenia in eight (19%), proteinuria in nine (21%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase in ten (24%), and alanine aminotransferase in five (12%) participants.
Interpretation
CAP256V2LS administered alone and in combination with VRC07-523LS was safe with favourable pharmacokinetics and neutralisation activity, supporting further assessment in larger clinical studies.

BONANI2025100709,A rapid and inclusive instrument for assessing children’s basic understanding of physical computing,"While there are many initiatives that strive to empower children with physical computing, there seems to be no validated questionnaire for rapidly measuring different children’s understanding of the basics of physical computing. This paper presents the design of such an instrument—PCBUQ. It is rapid in that it consists of few items. It is inclusive because designed for different young children. It is for the basics of physical computing in that it considers physical input and output devices, basic patterns and programs that use them for interacting with the physical world. Data gathered from experts, primary and middle schools were used to validate PCBUQ. The first items assess children’s capability of classifying physical devices as input (e.g., buttons), and output devices (e.g., LED, speaker). The other items evaluate whether children can interpret problematic scenarios and infer how to resolve them with adequate input and output devices, patterns and programs. PCBUQ was found to have adequate reliability. The reported statistical analyses highlight the items that strongly and weakly correlate with the construct under analysis, their difficulty and discrimination. Results are discussed to guide future physical computing initiatives for children and their assessment."
CHEN2022100001,"Vision, status, and topics of X Reality in Education","The maturity of 5G and artificial intelligence has promoted the XRED (X Reality in Education)'s application and implementation. XRED involves the application of X Reality (i.e., augmented reality, virtual reality, or mixed reality) technologies in the process of instruction and learning. Learning assisted by XR technologies can facilitate students' understanding of spatial structure and function, support their learning of language associations, contribute to long-term memory retention, improve physical task performance, enhance motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes, and promote the development of problem-solving abilities. In this study, we provide a general understanding of XRED by illustrating its development concerning funding support, publication venues, software tools, and research topics with the expectation of promoting its future advance and application. We also highlight the importance and necessity of launching the XRED-focused Elsevier journal: Computers & Education: X Reality."

HENDRICKX2021100474,Influence of sexual risk behaviour and STI co-infection dynamics on the evolution of HIV set point viral load in MSM,"HIV viral load (VL) is an important predictor of HIV progression and transmission. Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has been reported to reduce HIV transmission by lowering VL. However, apart from this beneficial effect, increased levels of population mean set-point viral load (SPVL), an estimator for HIV virulence, have been observed in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the decade following the introduction of ART in The Netherlands. Several studies have been devoted to explain these counter-intuitive trends in SPVL. However, to our knowledge, none of these studies has investigated an explanation in which it arises as the result of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) co-factor in detail. In this study, we adapted an event-based, individual-based model to investigate how STI co-infection and sexual risk behaviour affect the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM before and after the introduction of ART. The results suggest that sexual risk behaviour has an effect on SPVL and indicate that more data are needed to test the effect of STI co-factors on SPVL. Furthermore, the observed trends in SPVL cannot be explained by sexual risk behaviour and STI co-factors only. We recommend to develop mathematical models including also factors related to viral evolution as reported earlier in the literature. However, this requires more complex models, and the collection of more data for parameter estimation than what is currently available."
MEZINSKA2024100429,Design-driven innovation in STEM disciplines in higher education: The role and impact of transversal competences,"The purpose of this study is to explore students’ and academic staff’ perspectives on the importance of transversal competences in creating design-driven innovations within STEM disciplines in higher education, aiming to find solutions for the enhancement of transversal competences. Accordingly, the following research questions are explored in this study: 1) What is the connection between design-driven innovation and transversal competences in STEM disciplines in higher education? 2) How can students' and academic staff’s self-assessment of transversal competences influence the creation of design-driven innovations? Throughout this study, the authors analyze the promotion of design-driven innovation by enhancing the transversal competences of academic staff of STEM disciplines and students. The exploration of qualitative components of transversal competences enable the identification of conditions that may contribute design-driven innovations in higher education. By examining the link between design-driven innovations and transversal competences, added value in competence, design and values-based higher education, based on socio-cultural environment and technological development.

ERSTAD2023245,"Educational assessment of 21st century skills—novel initiatives, yet a lack of systemic transformation","Our aim is to discuss critical issues related to educational assessment in contemporary societies, especially of so-called 21st century skills. We introduce some key definitions of 21st century skills, outline international initiatives dedicated to advancing them, and present two examples of national curricular developments emphasizing and integrating these. Next, we present some examples of projects illustrating the interrelationship between assessment, education and technological development. Last, we introduce some perspectives on the assessment and transformation of education that point toward opportunities and pitfalls for the future. Our analysis shows that while there are a number of ongoing initiatives dedicated to developing instruments and curricula for assessment of 21st century skills, there are also fundamental challenges for the development of relevant assessments on a systemic level and for transforming practices related to 21st century skills more broadly. The lack of representation from several parts of the world, in international assessment initiatives on 21st century skills, is also striking. By taking a meta-perspective, we identify evolving themes within this field and provide a critical perspective on these developments. We conclude there are a number of opportunities and pitfalls for creating good synergies between 21st century skills in curricula and practices, as well as for developing assessment strategies."
JING2020644,A Learner Model Integrating Cognitive and Metacognitive And Its Application on Scratch Programming Projects,"learner’s cognitive and metacognitive are key personal profile for individualized teaching. To evaluate learner’s comprehensive characteristics, existing learner model were reviewed. Two challenges of constructing an accurate and comprehensive learner model integrating cognitive and metacognitive were summarized. A plan of constructing a comprehensive learner model was made based on analysis of existing massive online learning environment, sensor information technology and educational data-mining. As a case study, a method of how to map learning data onto learners’ cognitive and metacognitive was proposed based on an analysis of a number of pupils’ Scratch projects. Three mapping table were established. Pupil’s cognitive skill could be evaluated from technology shown from Scratch project, namely, data structure, algorithm, computational practices and overall evaluation. Content shown from Scratch project were used to infer pupil’s cognitive style. Meta-cognitive ability can be measured from computational practices and behavior in programming process."

ISMAILOVA2022463,Applicative approach to construe a computational model of concepts and individuals,"This paper considers the application of conceptual mathematics to construct a computational model of concepts and individuals. An applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. Since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. The nature of concepts – what concepts are – and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. It is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. The current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. The deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. The main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. Of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. Despite this “conceptual minimalism”, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. Using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis."
HUBNER2023104847,What predicts students’ future ICT literacy? Evidence from a large-scale study conducted in different stages of secondary school,"Information and communication technology (ICT) literacy is key to solving future societal challenges and to leading an independent and responsible life in an increasingly globalized and digitalized world. Hence, countries around the world have promoted research on students' ICT skills and their inclusion in curricula. Despite these efforts, little is known about what predicts future ICT literacy, and prior research has almost exclusively conducted cross-sectional studies. In the present study, we addressed this gap by using data from a large-scale longitudinal study of 6810 students in 311 schools from Germany. These students participated in the National Educational Panel Study over the course of secondary school (in Grades 6, 9, and 12). We were particularly interested in investigating potential spillover effects from skills and dispositions that are inherently fostered in school on ICT development. Thus, we considered a rich set of different types of predictors related to the students' social, cultural, demographic, and learning backgrounds; their subject-specific motivation; and the composition of their schools, and we assessed the extent to which these variables explained variation in ICT literacy development at two key stages in the educational system (Grades 9 and 12). Our results indicated that prior ICT literacy was the most important predictor of future ICT literacy but more so for the development between Grades 9 and 12. In addition, variables related to the students' learning backgrounds, followed by variables related to the composition of their schools and students' subject-specific motivation explained future ICT literacy. Overall, the predictors explained between 49% and 67% of the variation in future ICT literacy. Our longitudinal findings suggest that the learning environment and students’ skills and dispositions are crucial for understanding ICT development and are indicative of the deliberate design of ICT interventions."
PARK2022101157,Investigating a visual interface for elementary students to formulate AI planning tasks,"Recent years have seen the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in every facet of society. The ubiquity of AI has led to an increasing demand to integrate AI learning experiences into K-12 education. Early learning experiences incorporating AI concepts and practices are critical for students to better understand, evaluate, and utilize AI technologies. AI planning is an important class of AI technologies in which an AI-driven agent utilizes the structure of a problem to construct plans of actions to perform a task. Although a growing number of efforts have explored promoting AI education for K-12 learners, limited work has investigated effective and engaging approaches for delivering AI learning experiences to elementary students. In this article, we propose a visual interface to enable upper elementary students (grades 3–5, ages 8–11) to formulate AI planning tasks within a game-based learning environment. We present our approach to designing the visual interface as well as how the AI planning tasks are embedded within narrative-centered gameplay structured around a Use-Modify-Create scaffolding progression. Further, we present results from a study of upper elementary students using the visual interface. We discuss how the Use-Modify-Create approach supported student learning as well as discuss the misconceptions and usability issues students encountered while using the visual interface to formulate AI planning tasks."
ARTOPOULOS2023280,Knowledge economy meets development imaginaries,"Born in the mid-1990s, the term Knowledge Economy has been a driving force in discussion around development and education in the last three decades. It became the main legitimating argument for various programs promoting educational change and innovation by international organizations, national governments and social actors from industry, civil society, and academia. From a sociotechnical imaginaries approach, this paper aims to critically review the concept by mapping theoretical developments resulting from the dialog between applied research, policy proposals, and case studies. I will examine KE building as an endeavor that comprises symbolic and socio-material dimensions, analyzing discontinuities in specific structural and sociotechnical transitions. I propose conclude that there is no single, universal KE as a desirable development destination per se."

Moreover, this study proposes a set of policies and strategies that can serve as valuable tools for policymakers and researchers."
SUAZOHERNANDEZ2023139836,Effect of particle size of nanoscale zero–valent copper on inorganic phosphorus adsorption–desorption in a volcanic ash soil,"Zero–valent copper engineered nanoparticles (Cu–ENPs) released through unintentional or intentional actions into the agricultural soils can alter the availability of inorganic phosphorus (IP) to plants. In this study, we used adsorption–desorption experiments to evaluate the effect of particle size of 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) on IP availability in Santa Barbara (SB) volcanic ash soil. X–Ray Diffraction results showed that Cu–ENPs were formed by a mixture of Cu metallic and Cu oxides (Cu2O or/and CuO) species, while specific surface area values showed that Cu–ENPs/25 nm could form larger aggregate particles compared to Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm. The kinetic IP adsorption of SB soil without and with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm) followed the mechanism described by the pseudo–second–order (k2 = 0.45–1.13 x 10−3 kg mmol−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.999, and RSS ≤ 0.091) and Elovich (α = 14621.10–3136.20 mmol kg−1 min−1; r2 ≥ 0.984, and RSS ≤ 69) models. Thus, the rate–limiting step for IP adsorption in the studied systems was chemisorption on a heterogeneous surface. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms without Cu–ENPs were fitted well to the Freundlich model, while with 1% Cu–ENPs (25 nm and 40–60 nm), isotherms were described best by the Freundlich and/or Langmuir model. The IP relative adsorption capacity (KF) was higher with 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm (KF = 110.41) than for 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm (KF = 74.40) and for SB soil (KF = 48.17). This study showed that plausible IP retention mechanisms in the presence of 1% Cu–ENPs in SB soil were: i) ligand exchange, ii) electrostatic attraction, and iii) co–precipitate formation. The desorption study demonstrated that 1% Cu–ENPs/40–60 nm increased the affinity of IP in SB soil with a greater effect than 1% Cu–ENPs/25 nm. Thus, both the studied size ranges of Cu–ENPs could favor an accumulation of IP in volcanic ash soils."
KATONA2025100392,Integrating AI-based adaptive learning into the flipped classroom model to enhance engagement and learning outcomes,"This study explores the integration of the AI-powered adaptive learning system within the flipped classroom model and discusses programming education. The increasing demand for the acquisition of programming skills in the digital era generates the development of innovative pedagogical approaches to help students overcome the difficulties in mastering programming concepts. The study investigates how AI-based adaptive feedback influences student engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. This study was conducted for 13 weeks, with two groups of undergraduate students. In one of the groups, tshe traditional flipped classroom model was applied, while in the other group, AI-driven adaptive learning tools were introduced. In this research methodology, a mixed-methods approach was adopted, integrating quantitative analyses with qualitative data. These showed that the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in learning results and motivation, thereby realiszing the value of real-time, personalized feedback provided through the AI system. The qualitative findings revealed that with the AI system, there was an increase in student autonomy; thus, there is increased responsibility among students to collaborate in in-class participation, which helps enhance a more dynamic and cooperative learning environment. On the whole, these findings reveal important implications of the integration of AI into flipped classrooms, while at the same time, they reveal how to make the modernization of programming education achieve a better overall experience in student learning."
ASARE2022100433,"Depression onset and its association with community HIV prevalence: A geospatial and panel analyses of nationally representative South African data, 2015–2017","The scaling up of antiretroviral therapy services over the past decades has led to a remarkable reduction in HIV infections and HIV-related deaths in South Africa (SA). While this is a step in the right direction, it brings a new public health challenge into focus, namely psychological challenges associated with such chronic and often stigmatising condition in SA, home to the largest HIV epidemic. Given the current lack of national-level evidence, we investigated the role of the HIV epidemic on depression onset in SA using nationally representative panel data from the South African National Income Dynamics Study (SA-NIDS). Our incident cohort consisted of 13,020 sampled adult participants who were depression-free in Wave 4 (baseline year of 2015). We then measured the risk of depression onset in Wave 5 (year 2017) based on the level of HIV prevalence in the community where study participants resided at baseline. A High-resolution map of HIV spatial heterogeneity (i.e., community HIV prevalence) was generated using ordinary kriging mapping methods from a separate nationally representative data source that corresponded to the investigation period. Geospatial analyses were conducted to identify the spatial structure of HIV and depression onset, and generalised estimating equations (GEE) regression models were fitted to determine the risk of depression onset over time based on community HIV prevalence. Our geospatial analyses indicated that HIV and depression onset prevalence spatially overlapped in the eastern part of the country, particularly in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and Free State province. The GEE regression analyses indicated that individual residency in a community with high HIV prevalence was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression than a low HIV prevalence community (adjusted odds ratio =1.45, 95% CI=1.12-1.48). For the first time, we identified a geospatial overlap between HIV and depression, with a greater risk of depression onset in high HIV prevalence communities, at a national scale in SA. There is a need for place-based policy interventions that prioritise the availability of and access to mental health services in high HIV prevalent SA communities, in an ageing HIV epidemic."
GONG2024101641,Remixing between imitation and originality: Exploring creative behaviors in scratch projects,"Remixing is a balance between imitation and originality, which gets a lot of attention as an important source of creative behaviors. Exploring the relationship between the Scratch project and its remix would provide a new perspective for understanding users’ creative behaviors. To this end, this study used 20 projects and their 957 remixes as samples to analyze creative behavior in Scratch through quantitative statistics and correlation analysis. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What creative levels are there among the remixes? (2) What relationships are there between the project and its remixes? and (3) What creative trends are there indicated in the remixes? The main results are concluded as follows. First, four creative levels of remixes based on the SOLO taxonomy are found, including feature change, appearance change, element creation, and structure creation. Feature change has the highest sum of remixes, which indicates that most remixes are at a low creative level. Second, the internal characteristics of projects are related to the lower creative level of remix, while the external characteristics are attached to the higher creative level of remix. Finally, the two-level, three-level, and four-level iteration chain of remixes are found, in which remixes with high creativity is more likely to inspire remixes with lower or equal creativity. Based on these results, suggestions for further research and improvement are discussed. This study has important implications for understanding the creative level of remix among users in programming community and guiding users to make valuable remixes."
LU2024149,Chapter 11 - Coordinating planning of generation-grid-load-storage flexibility resources,"The addition of the flexibility balance constraint makes planning a high-dimensional, nonlinear stochastic optimization problem with a high mathematical challenge to solve. Therefore, it is urgent to establish an optimal solution model based on flexibility programming. Firstly, a bi-level coordinated flexibility programming model based on upper-level investment decisions and lower-level operation simulation is developed; the output, flexibility supply, and demand of all types of resources are described by random variables; and the probability constraints are handled by alternate iterations of the two-tiered optimization problem. Secondly, the maximum “net benefit increment ratio” algorithm is proposed to solve the optimized flexibility planning model."
DIMAKIS2025273,"Static, spherically symmetric solutions in f(Q)-gravity and in nonmetricity scalar-tensor theory","We solve the gravitational field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime within the framework of the symmetric teleparallel theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive new solutions within the context of power-law f(Q) gravity and the nonmetricity scalar-tensor theory. For the connection in the non-coincidence gauge, we present the point-like Lagrangian that describes the employed field equations. Furthermore, we construct two conservation laws, and for different values of these conserved quantities, we analytically solve the gravitational field equations. New solutions are obtained, we investigate their physical properties and their general relativistic limit. Finally, we discuss the algebraic properties for the derived spacetimes."
ISMAILOVA2021317,Prototype Mechanisms for Supporting the Network of Links to Parameterized Data Objects,"The paper considers methods to organize a network of links to parameterized data objects. A data object is an object identified by standard methods, including the network identifiers URI, URL and URN. The data objects can be either atomic or have a complex structure, including links to other objects, and this ensures the linking of objects into a network, which can be considered as an information graph. It turns out to be possible to formulate a number of criteria for supporting the integrity of such a structure; the paper proposes language tools to formulate such criteria. An essential feature of this network is the dependence of the objects’ information content on a number of parameters, first of all, on time. Depending on the parameter, the information content of the object can change both with the preservation of the integrity of the structure, and with its damage. The paper considers methods for a parameterized description of objects while maintaining integrity based on the formalism of category theory. The formalization used allows defining two relations between objects and their names (identifiers): access and links. The paper studies the basic properties of such relations and reveals the differences between them. Category theoretical means of describing objects require appropriate support tools for practical application. The paper proposes a configuration of support tools for a network of links to parameterized data objects based on a combination of conceptual modeling tools and applicative computing tools. The proposed tools provide basic methods of access to the network of information graphs. An essential feature of the proposed tools is the ability to determine the subjective way of considering the information graph (based on the category of correlations), as well as harmonizing an objective and subjective way of considering. The proposed tools were tested in the development of applied information systems in the field of implementation of the best available technologies (BAT)."

GASEVIC2022107304,Towards strengthening links between learning analytics and assessment: Challenges and potentials of a promising new bond,"Learning analytics uses large amounts of data about learner interactions in digital learning environments to understand and enhance learning. Although measurement is a central dimension of learning analytics, there has thus far been little research that examines links between learning analytics and assessment. This special issue of Computers in Human Behavior highlights 11 studies that explore how links between learning analytics and assessment can be strengthened. The contributions of these studies can be broadly grouped into three categories: analytics for assessment (learning analytic approaches as forms of assessment); analytics of assessment (applications of learning analytics to answer questions about assessment practices); and validity of measurement (conceptualization of and practical approaches to assuring validity in measurement in learning analytics). The findings of these studies highlight pressing scientific and practical challenges and opportunities in the connections between learning analytics and assessment that will require interdisciplinary teams to address: task design, analysis of learning progressions, trustworthiness, and fairness – to unlock the full potential of the links between learning analytics and assessment."

Recurrent disease outbreaks caused by a range of emerging and resurging pathogens over the past decade reveal major gaps in public health preparedness, detection, and response systems in Africa. Underlying causes of recurrent disease outbreaks include inadequacies in the detection of new infectious disease outbreaks in the community, in rapid pathogen identification, and in proactive surveillance systems. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of zoonotic outbreaks occur, there remains the perennial risk of outbreaks of new or re-emerging pathogens for which no vaccines or treatments are available. As the Ebola virus disease, COVID-19, and mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) outbreaks highlight, a major paradigm shift is required to establish an effective infrastructure and common frameworks for preparedness and to prompt national and regional public health responses to mitigate the effects of future pandemics in Africa."
PIMDEE2024e29172,Enhancing Thai student-teacher problem-solving skills and academic achievement through a blended problem-based learning approach in online flipped classrooms,"The study aimed to develop a learning model that enhances Thai student-teacher problem-solving skills (PSS) and academic achievement (AA) through a blended problem-based learning (PBL) approach in online flipped classrooms. Phase 1 consisted of the design of the Flipped PARSER (problem-attempt-research-solutions-evaluation-reflect) Model (FPM) through the study of documentation and research. Phase 2 involved using nine experts to assist with the model's development and evaluation using in-depth interviews and content analysis. Phase 3 involved the application and use of the FPM by 30 student-teachers, from which their AA, PSS, and satisfaction were evaluated against the control group of 31 participants. The results from the nine experts' input on the FPM design were significant. Instructor activities included selecting content, media, materials, and their design and development. Other components included learning activities, tools, lesson delivery, and evaluation. Also, PBL methods were again confirmed as an instrumental pedagogy in teaching PSS. When combined with online learning and flipped classrooms, the study's results were higher than those using traditional classroom methods. The study contributes to the literature by determining that online teaching models effectively teach PSS and raise AA scores."
LACHNEY2023100591,From endpoints to trading zones: Multi-directional exchange for computational empowerment in computer science education,"In this paper we build on a conceptual framing of computational empowerment that seeks to provide alternative endpoints for computer science (CS) education beyond degree attainment and job placement. But, as opposed to a teleological framing that prioritizes ends, we propose using the metaphor of trading zones to construct a framing for computational empowerment that is based on collaborative multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge between people with different expertise. This leaves the co-design and implementation of CS education open to emergent directions and possibilities. Using a descriptive case study methodology, we detail trading zones in two different co-design projects that sought to situate CS education in relationship to cultural contexts through multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge: (1) a co-design project in a youth boxing gym with coaches, mentors, and staff; (2) a co-design project in a high school barbering program with a barbering instructor and barbering students. Our findings show that the metaphor is useful for the concept of computational empowerment in ways that are reflexive and interventionist."
HOFSTETTER2020100007,Sustainable ICT equals not ICT for sustainability,"In this opinion paper we promote the idea of an open dialogue to take place from within the Sustainable Futures journal that will offer the opportunity to a wide range of actors and stakeholders to present their ideas, concerns and worries on a variety of issues relevant and related to aspects of sustainability. Such an open-ended approach will help overcome opposing dynamics that currently cater for polarization and as a result to the segregation within the scientific community and the society at large. On the positive side, there is a wide spectrum of ambitious, game-changing and disruptive initiatives that can be taken from academia, from the industry, from the activists’ movements and the citizens at large, which will aim to increase our freedoms and not reduce them."
LEONE2021103650,Advanced modelling and digital manufacturing: Parametric design tools for the optimization of UHPFRC (ultra high-performance Fiber reinforced concrete) shading panels,"The “Industry 4.0” production scenarios are determining a paradigm shift in the design of building components. The growing trend of orienting technological innovation in the building sector towards the eco-efficiency of industrial manufacturing processes increasingly requires to identify methods and tools able to support the design/manufacturing/construction process as a whole. In this sense, the intellectual and operational dimension of design is discovering a new digital and data-driven technological paradigm. Digital tools are pushing the investigation of the building component manufacturing process into an increasingly virtual dimension, in which the constant integration between environmental and material/geometric parameters identifies the meta-design phase as the “ideal place” to experiment the creative use of data and technical knowledge. Starting from these assumptions, the paper illustrates an original design methodology and the related digital/parametric workflow aimed at optimizing performances and production of a façade shading system realized in UHPFRC (Ultra High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete). The workflow described in this paper includes all the constraints arising from production and the assembly aspects of the components and, with the support of genetic algorithms, aims to improve indoor thermal comfort and indoor daylight performance while containing costs."
DESHPANDE20244449,The evolution of computational research in a data-centric world,"Summary
Computational data-centric research techniques play a prevalent and multi-disciplinary role in life science research. In the past, scientists in wet labs generated the data, and computational researchers focused on creating tools for the analysis of those data. Computational researchers are now becoming more independent and taking leadership roles within biomedical projects, leveraging the increased availability of public data. We are now able to generate vast amounts of data, and the challenge has shifted from data generation to data analysis. Here we discuss the pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities facing the field of data-centric research in biology. We discuss the evolving perception of computational data-driven research and its rise as an independent domain in biomedical research while also addressing the significant collaborative opportunities that arise from integrating computational research with experimental and translational biology. Additionally, we discuss the future of data-centric research and its applications across various areas of the biomedical field."
HORVATH2024593,"AI for conceptual architecture: Reflections on designing with text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image generators","In this paper we present a research-through-design study where we employed text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image generative tools for a conceptual architecture project for the eVolo skyscraper competition. We trained these algorithms on a dataset that we collected and curated, consisting of texts about and images of architecture. We describe our design process, present the final proposal, reflect on the usefulness of such tools for early-stage design, and discuss implications for future research and practice. By analysing the results from training the text-to-text generators we could establish a specific design brief that informed the final concept. The results from the image-to-image generator gave an overview of the shape grammars of previous submissions. All results were intriguing and can assist creativity and in this way, the tools were useful for gaining insight into historical architectural data, helped shape a specific design brief, and provoked new ideas. By reflecting on our design process, we argue that the use of language when employing such tools takes a new role and that three layers of language intertwined in our work: architectural discourse, programming languages, and annotations. We present a map that unfolds how these layers came together as a contribution to making machine learning more explainable for creatives."
NYONI2022100434,Spatial clustering of codeine use and its association with depression: a geospatial analysis of nationally representative South African data,"Background
There is an alarming trend in sub-Saharan Africa in the use of codeine-containing pharmaceuticals, but its risk of common comorbidities, such as mental health, remains unquantified at a national-level. We investigated the relationship between codeine use and onset of depression in South Africa at a population-level.
Methods
We used nationally representative panel data from the South Africa National Income Dynamic Study to investigate the relationship between exposure to codeine use in the community (i.e. residing in a codeine hotspot) and onset of depression. Geographical hotspots of codeine use were identified using Kulldorff spatial scan statistic in SaTScan. We quantified depression onset at Wave 5 (year 2017) between individuals residing inside and outside a codeine hotspot who were depression-free at enrolment (Wave 4: 2015) using generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression models.
Results
We identified four statistically significant hotspots of codeine use, mostly located at the northern part of the country. Among 13,020 participants who were depression-free at enrolment, residing within a codeine use hotspot was significantly associated with higher subsequent onset of depression (aRR=1.21, 95% CI:1.08-1.44).
Limitations
Data on diagnosis of depressive disorder were not available.
Conclusion
South Africa, a resource scarce nation with chronically limited mental health services, is not spared from the global opioid epidemic and its impact on depression. Targeted scale-up access to agonist therapy to effectively treat (opioid) addiction in communities at risk for high exposure to codeine use could reduce the risk of subsequent mental health challenges."
GENNARI2023103006,Design for social digital well-being with young generations: Engage them and make them reflect,"Digital well-being traditionally means limiting the effects on individuals of technology abuses. However, in a broader perspective, it can be crucial to consider the pervasiveness of technology, and the effect it can have not only on individuals but also on their peers in the context of diverse everyday-life situations. Within this view, which emphasises the social side of digital well-being, the paper argues the need of educating young generations to participate in the making of technology for a social goal and have a reflective attitude towards technology and its impact on society. It, therefore, presents a design toolkit as a means to (i) engage young generations to become active in design for social digital well-being and, thanks to the exposure to how technology works, (ii) reflect deeply on the pros and cons of technology in use in their everyday life. By presenting the results of a study with 24 high-school pupils and their teachers, the paper discusses how a phygital toolkit, which structures the design process, engages them in the rapid prototyping of their own smart things, and how it acts as a proxy for soliciting their own reflections around technology and social digital well-being."
WERNLI2023102096,Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration in computational diplomacy: A multi-layered network approach to improve our understanding of institutional complexity and effective governance design,"While the study of global governance is moving from a focus on component-dominated to interaction-dominated systems, the present paper reviews development in governance theories from a complexity perspective and discuss how governance systems can be represented in terms of multi-layered networks. Such representation is useful to foster interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers working in global governance/international relations and data science/computational science. The combination of a data-driven approach with computational modelling paves the way to both contribute to a more fundamental understanding of how multilateral governance systems work and to address some important contemporary questions about institutional complexity and the effectiveness of governance design."
ZHAO2025101780,Developing an innovative design model for Xinjiang brocades based on design thinking,"The Xinjiang brocade as a significant cultural textile records the historical and cultural information. Public awareness of this cultural heritage often involves related product development efforts. However, the current development of Xinjiang brocades faces challenges, including insufficient refinement of design elements and a lack of sustainable innovation methods. To address these issues, this study proposed a Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model by applying design thinking (DT). The DT process for the Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model was first constructed in terms of applying Action Design Research (ADR). In addition, primary issues of Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design were identified by applying Empathize Map and Delphi Method. The prototype for Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design was then obtained through brainstorming, Adobe Experience Design, and so on. Moreover, the application of this Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model was conducted with developing a Xinjiang brocade innovative design system, and it was validated. The results show the effectiveness of the Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model, which not only organizes the knowledge and product information of existing Xinjiang brocades but also facilitates innovative customization, thereby enhancing user satisfaction."
HOYO202285,Bringing Automatics and Robotics closer to pre-university students,"This article describes the experience of the Automatic Control, Robotics and Mecha-tronics Research Group from the University of Almería in the participation and preparation of workshops for teaching programming, control engineering and robotics to young students. All the activities designed to encourage the study of STEM careers among young students are described. Some activities are focused on directly promoting Automatics and Robotics disciplines. Others deal with encouraging the participation of women in science, and so, breaking gender inequality. Two main workshops, where first- and second-year students collaborate directly with the University of Almería, are also described in detail. Finally, this paper shows the growth in the number of students who enrolled in engineering degrees thanks to these dissemination activities."

MANCA2021104025,"“Think globally, act locally”: A glocal approach to the development of social media literacy","Despite the documented number of studies that investigate social media in teaching and learning settings, the topic of social media literacy is still an under-researched area. This study adopts the theoretical lens of New Literacy studies to suggest a combined perspective for investigating social media literacies. This perspective considers both social media skills that are transversal across different social media (global skills), and those that pertain to a specific social media platform (local skills). It examines practices that are decontextualized (literacy as something to be acquired), and those that are situated and context-dependent (literacy through participation). To map current research on social media skills, a systematic literature review was conducted. Analysis of 54 publications was carried out following the UNESCO DLGF framework for digital literacy competencies, and also using a critical lens based on four metaphors whereby, for learning purposes, social media are seen as a tool, as a process, as collaboration, and as participation. The results show that most of the studies consider global social media skills, while only a few examine skills sets specific to a particular social media platform. In addition, most of the identified skills concern decontextualized practices, with very few studies emphasizing the importance of fostering situated social media practices. We conclude that there is a need for more expansive theoretical elaboration in the field, and provide a number of recommendations for investigating, understanding, and designing educational curricula and activities that support the development of social media literacy."
PURZER202336,Engineering education,"Engineering entered into pre-college education with a heightened position in the early years of the 21st century. This integration took place in diverse ways and with a diverse range of motivation. This article articulates this diversity and argues for a careful examination of pre-college curriculum and practices in engineering. In particular, an understanding on the engineering philosophy and practices of the engineering profession must guide curriculum decisions to enable authentic and engaging learning and inclusive education."
WANG2021100031,An investigation of barriers to Hong Kong K-12 schools incorporating Artificial Intelligence in education,"Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has been the focus of significant attention in recent years because of its growing social importance and pedagogical value. In Hong Kong, an increasing number of K-12 schools are planning or piloting their grassroots AIED incorporation practices. However, progress is reportedly slow due to a number of barriers. Unfortunately, because of their limited scope, disputed interpretations and contextual irrelevance, current research literature seems to be of limited referencing value in aiding schools to address the issues and overcome the barriers. This paper highlights the necessity of embracing AIED as wide-ranging given the current understanding of it as a collective notion. Three major directions of AIED are identified: Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI. A collective case study, which examined the perceived barriers to AIED incorporation in Hong Kong K-12 schools with different AIED directions, was conducted. Qualitative data were gathered via ten semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from two schools. Ertmer’s (1999) typology was applied to segregate the barriers. The findings showed that both first-order and second-order barriers existed, although they varied between the cases. It was also found that the barriers did not hinder in isolation but appeared to be interconnected. The findings suggest that schools use differentiated strategies to tackle barriers according to their approach to incorporating AIED. Moreover, there is a need to trace the links between barriers and prioritise school efforts to remove or reduce them with high linkage. Several recommendations for practice are given."
KORTE2024100164,Enhancing artificial intelligence literacy through cross-cultural online workshops,"This article presents the results of a study conducted in collaboration with two universities – one in Lapland (Finland) and the other in Hong Kong (China) – during the development of an international university course on global media education. The objective of the study was to examine international students’ changing conceptual understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy as part of the course. The need for this study arose from the recent rapid spread of AI across industries, which has connected human learning to machine learning. This requires competence in AI to contribute to future society. Five hours of online lectures on AI literacy were delivered during two workshops to students (N = 29) from 13 countries with no or limited prior knowledge of the subject in 2021 and 2022. The participants filled out pre- and post-workshop quantitative questionnaires and wrote diaries about their learning process, the development of their understanding of AI-literacy concepts, and their thoughts on the pedagogical approaches used. The quantitative data were analysed using a paired-samples t-test, while the qualitative data were examined using thematic-content analysis. The findings show that the students’ knowledge of AI and their awareness of the importance of AI literacy and media education increased significantly. Further research is needed so that a more appropriate curriculum can be designed for them. We outline some key activities that offer interactive and participatory ways to learn AI in order to assist educators in planning and delivering AI-literacy courses as part of cross-cultural media education."
VALCARCEDEVEER2021160,Approaching informal learning about #feminism on Twitter,"Purpose
In a socio-educational context impregnated by social networks, feminist organizations and individuals have turned to social media to spread their knowledge. This paper aims to approach how feminist tweets are produced to ignite meaningful informal learning (IL) processes.
Design/methodology/approach
This study uses an interdisciplinary mixed methodology. By using Twitter tracking tools, a database has been enabled to catalogue feminist hashtags into topics and categories for further analysis. These data have been contrasted with surveys to the managers of the most followed feminist accounts in Spain and Catalonia.
Findings
From an educational perspective, the analysed feminist hashtags have been organized in 13 different topic categories. The different propagation processes on Twitter – tweeting and retweeting – imply diverse learning processes. Moreover, tweets with complementary information such as images or links generate the most interaction, being the preferred format for IL.
Research limitations/implications
Researching with Big Data in educational sciences is a field in development, and Twitter data collection tools are mostly addressed to marketing and economic sectors; thus, free tools with limited services were used, offering the analysis of a brief and concrete situation of a platform in constant change. Although this ephemeral data and its relevance does not prevail over time, it has an impact on citizens’ learning.
Originality/value
It is the first study in Spain that illustrates the informal education that feminism offers to the community, facing the complexity of measuring Twitter with an educational perspective through the use of marketing tools."
WIDJAJA2025111604,A BIM-based intelligent approach to rebar layout optimization for reinforced concrete columns,"This study aims to address inefficiencies and errors in current manual rebar practices within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, which contribute to significant rebar waste. The Design-Bid-Build (DBB) project delivery method further exacerbates these issues by hindering effective stakeholder collaboration. By contrast, integrated project delivery and building information modeling (BIM) have shown potential for enhanced coordination and waste reduction. Yet, the continued reliance on manual rebar modeling in BIM highlights a pressing need for intelligent automation. This study presents a novel BIM-based algorithm that leverages Dynamo for rebar layout optimization and Navisworks for automatic clash detection, integrating rebar optimization prior to BIM model creation to minimize data exchange errors. The methodology was validated on a continuous-column rebar arrangement, supported by a standardized rebar summary sheet to streamline the optimization and clash-detection process. Key findings indicate that this approach significantly reduces working hours while achieving high modeling accuracy compared to traditional manual methods. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to transform rebar layout practices, enabling smart, efficient, and sustainable construction through automated clash-free rebar layout generation."
BACK202423,Accelerated chemical science with AI,"In light of the pressing need for practical materials and molecular solutions to renewable energy and health problems, to name just two examples, one wonders how to accelerate research and development in the chemical sciences, so as to address the time it takes to bring materials from initial discovery to commercialization. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are having a transformative and accelerating impact on many if not most, technological domains. To shed light on these questions, the authors and participants gathered in person for the ASLLA Symposium on the theme of ‘Accelerated Chemical Science with AI’ at Gangneung, Republic of Korea. We present the findings, ideas, comments, and often contentious opinions expressed during four panel discussions related to the respective general topics: ‘Data’, ‘New applications’, ‘Machine learning algorithms’, and ‘Education’. All discussions were recorded, transcribed into text using Open AI's Whisper, and summarized using LG AI Research's EXAONE LLM, followed by revision by all authors. For the broader benefit of current researchers, educators in higher education, and academic bodies such as associations, publishers, librarians, and companies, we provide chemistry-specific recommendations and summarize the resulting conclusions."
PRASADPANDEY2025100736,"Exploring STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) toys in kindergarten: Teachers' pedagogical approaches, perspective and effect on Children's brain development: A systematic literature review","This systematic literature review explores pedagogical approaches of kindergarten teachers' to facilitate children's play with STEM toys. This review summarises teachers' perspectives on the utilisation of STEM toys in children studying in kindergarten and describes the outcomes of children's development resulting from playing with STEM toys. The present systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA-2020 checklist. The search engines used were Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, and other journal databases including ScienceDirect, Springer, Taylor & Francis etc. for papers published between 2010 and 2024. These searches yielded 2352 peer-reviewed articles. The application of the selection and rejection criteria led to the formation of a shortlisting 32 papers, following the initial evaluation. The findings revealed the various approaches that teachers can employ during play sessions with STEM toys while teaching. Kindergarten teachers take on the roles of facilitators and mediators, promote collaborative work, and encourage children to perform experiments and learn from failure. Furthermore, the findings of this study revealed that kindergarten teachers generally maintain favourable and constructive perspectives regarding the utilisation of STEM toys. The results underscore positive impacts on cognitive abilities of children like problem-solving and critical thinking, and socio-emotional skills like verbal communication from using STEM toys. Comprehensive teacher training is emphasised to identify methodologies that complement the technology, maximizing teaching-learning benefits for children's brain development."
ZENG2025102631,"The role of growth mindset, self-efficacy, and environmental support in ICT practices for creative thinking development","Creativity is regarded as an essential skill of the 21st century. In technological advancement, fostering students’ creativity is particularly crucial. This study examines how creative growth mindsets, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) self-efficacy, creative environments, ICT availability, and ICT information practices influence creative self-efficacy (CSE) and creative thinking. The study conducted path analyses on 16,148 secondary school students in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, China in PISA 2022. The results showed that growth mindsets, ICT self-efficacy, and creative environments can directly promote their creative self-efficacy and thinking, while school environments negatively impact creative thinking. Besides, online information practices mediate the relationship between predictors, CSE, and creative thinking. However, ICT feedback and support do not serve as mediators for creative thinking. ICT availability at school positively affects CSE through ICT feedback, while ICT availability outside of school has a negative effect. This study highlights the combined influence of individual traits, behaviors, and external environments on students’ creative thinking, providing valuable insights for educators to take a holistic approach to fostering student development."

MOHAMED2025102473,Hands-on analysis of using large language models for the auto evaluation of programming assignments,"The increasing adoption of programming education necessitates efficient and accurate methods for evaluating students’ coding assignments. Traditional manual grading is time-consuming, often inconsistent, and prone to subjective biases. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) for the automated evaluation of programming assignments. LLMs can use advanced natural language processing capabilities to assess code quality, functionality, and adherence to best practices, providing detailed feedback and grades. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs through experiments comparing their performance with human evaluators across various programming tasks. Our study evaluates the performance of several LLMs for automated grading. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves an exact match accuracy of 86% and a ±1 accuracy of 98%. GPT-4o also demonstrates strong performance, with exact match and ±1 accuracies of 69% and 97%, respectively. Both models correlate highly with human evaluations, indicating their potential for reliable automated grading. However, models such as Llama 3 70B and Mixtral 8 × 7B exhibit low accuracy and alignment with human grading, particularly in problem-solving tasks. These findings suggest that advanced LLMs are instrumental in scalable, automated educational assessment. Additionally, LLMs enhance the learning experience by offering personalized, instant feedback, fostering an iterative learning process. The findings suggest that LLMs could play a pivotal role in the future of programming education, ensuring scalability and consistency in evaluation."
AKTOPRAK2022101029,A BIBLIOMETRIC AND CONTENT ANALYSIS OF CRITICAL THINKING IN PRIMARY EDUCATION,"Critical thinking is an effective skill that allows students to be successful in the continually changing world by playing a role in their thinking development. Although the significance of critical thinking in primary education has been discussed in many studies, the number of studies conducted on the subject is limited. This study aims to systematically review and analyse the literature by taking a holistic approach to previous studies in order to clearly identify the gaps in the field and the steps to be taken for future studies. In this context, two different analysis methods were employed in the study. This review aims to reveal information that has not been fully captured or evaluated previously, including information related to important sources, documents, countries, and keywords used in the field. According to the results obtained from the study, the country with the highest publication performance is the United States of America, and the most cited publication source is the Journal of Thinking Skills and Creativity. The most frequently studied concepts in the documents are identified as 21st century skills, assessment, creativity, learning, teaching, teacher, education, and primary school. Another result obtained reveals that articles on critical thinking, which increased between 2015 and 2020, mostly discussed critical thinking in the fields of mathematics and science education. Studies that examine the development of critical thinking skills through the implementation of different teaching methods are particularly in the majority. According to the analysis results of the article methodologies, it is revealed that the majority are based on the qualitative research approach, the criterion sampling method is used with small sample groups, and the most preferred data collection tool is the document. In addition to revealing the current status regarding the research tendencies of critical thinking in primary education, these results have the potential to guide researchers, countries and primary school teachers working in the field."
LIN2021101075,The landscape of Block-based programming: Characteristics of block-based environments and how they support the transition to text-based programming,"Block-based programming (BBP) environments have become increasingly commonplace computer science education. Despite a rapidly expanding ecosystem of BBP environments, text-based languages remain the dominant programming paradigm, motivating the transition from BBP to text-based programming (TBP). Support students in transitioning from BBP to TBP is an important and open design question. This work identifies 101 unique BBP environments, analyzes the 46 of them and identifies different design approaches used to support the transition to TBP. The contribution of this work is to provide a snapshot of the current state of BBP environments and how they support learners in transitioning to TBP."
RUIZ2025103222,Rural education imaginaries in digital education policy: an analysis of CONPES 3988 in Colombia,"This paper explores the digital imaginaries presented in the educational governance and policy landscape of Colombia through the lens of rurality. It interrogates one policy instrument, namely CONPES 3988, which establishes the importance of digital technologies in national-level educational policies and subsequent strategies. CONPES 3988 draws a strong focus on educational ‘innovation’, which is explicitly conceptualised through digital technology, understood as the transformation of traditional educational practices through educational technologies to improve educational quality. CONPES 3988 establishes the actions needed to realise a process of educational innovation through educational technologies and has four pillars: to increase access to digital technologies for the creation of innovative learning spaces, to improve Internet connectivity of official educational institutions, to promote the appropriation of digital technologies in the educational community, and to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of the use, access and impact of digital technologies in education. CONPES 3988 draws a strong focus on educational ‘innovation’, which is explicitly conceptualised through digital technology, understood as the transformation of traditional educational practices through educational technologies to improve educational quality. CONPES 3988 captures and surfaces digital imaginaries that speak to rural education, particularly in how it is framed and performed and how digital technology use is explicitly tied to market discourses of quality, sustainability, transformation, and breaks from tradition. Rural education in Colombia, and indeed rurality itself and its attendant plurality, are potentially disadvantaged in this framing as they become transactional actors in a larger educational system framed increasingly in digital technologies emerging from the urban centres of the Colombian government. Such an analysis provides insights that extend well beyond Colombia, particularly in noting how rurality and rural education are reframed when there is policy and governance emphasis on digital technology use in education."
ERDURAN2023254,Learning to teach epistemic practices of science in secondary schools,"The article explores how teachers' learning of epistemic practices of science can be supported. The particular focus will be on argumentation in science as an epistemic practice. Following a review of the literature on epistemic practices including examples of argumentation, modeling and explanations, we focus on teachers' learning of argumentation. An important element of teachers' understanding of argumentation in science as an epistemic practice involves how they might potentially distinguish it from argumentation in other subject domains. In other words, given a broad set of subjects can be considered from an argumentation perspective (e.g., religious education, history, English), what differentiates argumentation as an epistemic practice of science? We will address this question by contrasting how argumentation is framed broadly in epistemic practices of two contrasting school subjects: science and religious education. Following this theoretical account, we will then draw on some empirical data from the Oxford Argumentation in Religion and Science project based in England to illustrate how in-service science teachers view argumentation and engage in its teaching. Implications for curriculum reform as well as teacher education are discussed."
ZULNAIDI2024104151,Ethical mediation: The influence of mathematics teachers cooperation on readiness for the industrial revolution era in Indonesia and Malaysia,"This study contributes to the existing body of research by examining the mediating effect of ethics in the relationship between mathematics teacher cooperation and readiness. It fills a gap in the literature by investigating the ethical dimensions of collaboration and their impact on readiness for the industrial revolution. This study aims to determine the mediator effect of ethics between the relationship of Mathematics Teacher Cooperation and Readiness in Facing the Era of Industrial Revolution. The study involved a total of 231 mathematics teachers in Indonesia and a total of 384 mathematics teachers in Malaysia using simple random sampling. A survey was conducted to determine the readiness of mathematics teachers in facing the industrial revolution. This study used SEM analysis (using AMOS software) to determine the model of teacher readiness facing the era of industrial revolution such as the direct effect of mathematics teacher cooperation and readiness in facing the era of industrial revolution, the essence of ethics as mediators of the relationship between mathematics teacher cooperation and readiness in facing the era of industrial revolution. The study findings showed collaboration has significant effect on IR4.0 readiness and the direct effect of collaboration on ethics was also significant. Indirectly, ethics has a significant mediating effect in the contribution between collaboration on the readiness of IR4.0 among mathematics teachers in Indonesia and Malaysia. A partial mediator occurred in the results of this study. In conclusion, the study's implications and recommendations emphasize the importance of collaborative practices, ethics, and cross-cultural considerations in preparing mathematics teachers for the Industrial Revolution era in Indonesia and Malaysia. These recommendations highlight the significance of policy support, professional development, ethical guidelines, and research-informed practices to enhance readiness for the challenges brought about by technological advancements."
LORE2024105149,"Using multiple, dynamically linked representations to develop representational competency and conceptual understanding of the earthquake cycle","Using computational methods to produce and interpret multiple scientific representations is now a common practice in many science disciplines. Research has shown students have difficulty in moving across, connecting, and sensemaking from multiple representations. There is a need to develop task-specific representational competencies for students to reason and conduct scientific investigations using multiple representations. In this study, we focus on three representational competencies: 1) linking between representations, 2) disciplinary sensemaking from multiple representations, and 3) conceptualizing domain-relevant content derived from multiple representations. We developed a block code-based computational modeling environment with three different representations and embedded it within an online activity for students to carry out investigations around the earthquake cycle. The three representations include a procedural representation of block codes, a geometric representation of land deformation build-up, and a graphical representation of deformation build-up over time. We examined the extent of students' representational competencies and which competencies are most correlated with students’ future performance in a computationally supported geoscience investigation. Results indicate that a majority of the 431 students showed at least some form of representational competence. However, a relatively small number of students showed sophisticated levels of linking, sensemaking, and conceptualizing from the representations. Five of seven representational competencies, the most prominent being code sensemaking (η2 = 0.053, p < 0.001), were significantly correlated to student performance on a summative geoscience investigation."
BHADURI2025100723,Community partnership design of a maker-related camp for underserved youth: Impacts on youths’ present and future learning trajectories,"This paper describes the design of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) maker-related activities offered to middle school youth as part of a free, four-week summer camp. The camp was aimed at academically at-risk youth in a rural, tourism-oriented mountain community with significant income disparities. Guided by an educational model focused on enhancing youths’ present and future interests in and visions of STEM and computing fields, camp activities were collaboratively designed by a community partnership comprised of a local camp provider, the local school district, and researchers. Situating design in a community partnership helped highlight and integrate locally relevant resources, careers, and community opportunities. The paper also reports findings from a study examining how the STEM maker camp activities, which leveraged 3D modeling and printing practices, impacted youths’ perceptions of their disciplinary identity, engagement, and their present and future visions of the relevance of these STEM practices to themselves and their communities. The study also explores design tensions that emerged during the camp design process and identified barriers and opportunities that arose from balancing the needs of each partner, the research team’s focus on youth-centered learning, and the overall program goals."
ISMAILOVA2021324,A Semantic Model for Indexing in the Hidden Web,"We argue that that the use of the Carnap - Bar-Hillel principle of indexed expressions provides a suitable cognitive model to undergo the spread of information processes in the Semantic Net. To understand the stratification of the net into the surface Web and the hidden Web, a model structure is proposed that provides navigation through the net as a whole. For logical expressions, a relativized evaluation map is given, which is parameterized by the indexing system. It is allowed to use concepts that are generated using partial functions, the variables of which run over the range of possible individual information processes. A generalized operator providing virtualization is presented for individuals. The process is accompanied with the dynamic generation of Web-pages, which triggers their indexing. This way they are thereby transferred to the surface layer of the network. A commutative diagram is proposed that establishes a cognitive model of semantic constructions of variable domains, the connection of virtual individuals with actual ones which corresponds to transitions over the stages of knowledge. The knowledge stages are modeled by indexing systems."
VISEU2025103262,"Education governance, philanthropy and knowledge brokering: The case of a digital education programme by a private foundation in Portugal","This article focuses how philanthropy leverages knowledge brokering to promote the digitalisation of education and expand its influence on education governance. It presents an empirical study of a digital education programme launched in Portugal in 2020 by a private foundation. Through document analysis and an interview, the findings reveal that knowledge brokering enabled the foundation to bring together actors from different social worlds to conceive, legitimise and deliver the programme in public schools. Furthermore, knowledge brokering created new policy spaces that amplified the foundation’s role in educational governance, positioning Ed-Tech as a new topology for educational delivery."
VERDUGOCASTRO2022e10300,The gender gap in higher STEM studies: A systematic literature review,"The development of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) requires more qualified professionals in these fields. However, gender segregation in higher education in this sector is creating a gender gap that means that for some disciplines female representation does not even reach 30% of the total. In order to propose measures to address the phenomenon, it is necessary to understand the possible causes of this issue. A systematic literature review and mapping were carried out for the study, following the PRISMA guidelines and flowchart. The research questions to be answered were (RQ1) What studies exist on the gender gap in relation to the choice of higher education in the STEM field; and (RQ2) How do gender roles and stereotypes influence decision-making related to higher education? The review of peer-reviewed scientific articles, conferences texts, books and book chapters on the European education area was applied. A total of 4571 initial results were obtained and, after the process marked by the PRISMA flowchart, the final results were reduced to 26. The results revealed that gender stereotypes are strong drivers of the gender gap in general, and the Leaky Pipeline and Stereotype Threat in particular. To narrow the gender gap, it is necessary to focus on influences from the family, the educational environment, and the peer group, as well as from the culture itself. Positive self-concept, self-efficacy, self-confidence, and self-perception need to be fostered, so that the individual chooses their studies according to their goals."
LI2025104500,The Security Awareness Adventure: A serious game for security awareness training utilizing a state transition system and a probabilistic model,"Social engineering attacks target people who lack awareness of security. These attacks have become increasingly threatening to modern software systems, which rely heavily on human interactions. Recent studies propose to conduct serious game-based security training against such threats. However, it is challenging to simulate real-world scenarios in serious games, making the training less effective. In this paper, we introduce Security Awareness Adventure, a novel social engineering serious game that allows participants to play the role of attackers and realistically experience the social engineering attack process from the attacker’s perspective. Our game works with state transition models to realistically simulate stakeholder interactions within specific scenarios and to capture stakeholders’ alternative behaviors using a branching system. To evaluate our game’s effectiveness, we conducted an experiment with 41 participants and a real social engineering security scenario. The experimental results show that our game can effectively improve the learner’s security awareness."
CHAIARWUT2025101338,"Enhancing executive mathematics problem-solving through a constructivist digital learning platform: Design, development and evaluation","Recent international assessments have highlighted a global decline in mathematics performance, particularly among students in Thailand. This study aims to (1) design and evaluate a constructivist learning innovation model on a digital platform that promotes executive mathematics problem-solving and (2) develop and assess a prototype based on the designed model. A mixed-method research design was employed across two phases. Phase 1 involved designing and evaluating the learning model through document analysis and expert validation (n = 9). Phase 2 focused on developing and testing a prototype with experts (n = 15) and students (n = 30). Data collection utilized the Index of Item-Objective Congruence (IOC), System Usability Scale (SUS), and User Engagement Scale (UES). The model showed strong alignment with theoretical principles (IOC = 0.84). The prototype showed excellent usability (SUS = 91.0/100) and high engagement (UES = 4.26/5.00). Expert evaluations indicated high quality in content (M = 4.47, SD = 0.48), media (M = 4.40, SD = 0.50), and innovation design (M = 4.59, SD = 0.64). The findings validate the model's efficacy in promoting executive mathematics problem-solving skills through a constructivist digital platform approach."
FUNDI2024100412,Advancing AI education: Assessing Kenyan in-service teachers' preparedness for integrating artificial intelligence in competence-based curriculum,"With the advancement of technology, emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) have also been growing rapidly and becoming more common than ever before. Kenya has taken tremendous steps in adopting the use of emerging technology in different sectors of the economy. In realization of the need to have a skilled digital workforce to develop solutions using these emerging technologies, Kenya has undertaken curriculum reforms and introduced the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) which has included digital literacy and coding in elementary school. Furthermore, computer science has been introduced in Junior Secondary School. In view of these changes, teachers should be adequately prepared with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to effectively teach these new technologies. However, in Kenya, AI was not and still is not part of the teacher training curriculum. Additionally, there are inadequate professional development opportunities in AI for both pre-service and in-service teachers since AI is not part of the CBC curriculum. That notwithstanding, it is inevitable for teachers in the current world to introduce AI to learners. Therefore, this study's objectives were to assess the confidence in AI, attitudes toward AI, AI ethics, subjective norms, perceived threats, and the readiness to teach AI among Kenyan K-12 in-service teachers and to assess how these factors influence their readiness to teach AI. To achieve these objectives, this study employed a quantitative research methodology by administering a survey using Google Forms to a random sample of 308 teachers from different grades from 37 out of 47 counties in Kenya. The findings showed that confidence in AI, AI ethics and subjective norms significantly influenced AI readiness while attitude towards AI and perceived threats did not significantly influence AI readiness. These results are significant in providing a basis for education policy change on AI education in Kenya, such as transforming the teacher training curriculum to include AI and designing AI professional development programs for in-service teachers to ensure they are well-equipped to teach AI."
AVELAR2025103192,Mapping the digital education landscape: Stakeholders and networks of governance in Brazil,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the digitalization of education, integrating digital tools such as platforms, apps, games, and virtual learning environments into schools worldwide.

This paper maps the stakeholder groups and their interconnections within Brazil’s digital education governance networks, identifying the most influential and well-connected organizations. It explores their interactions, highlighting collaborative efforts to drive education reform through technology. Employing network ethnography and a policy-following approach, this paper analyses the digital education landscape in Brazil, with critical insights into the governance dynamics shaping education."
TORRESTORRITI2025103030,An algorithm for processing block diagram models of dynamical systems and an open-source visual-programming simulation tool,"Visual diagrammatic programming and block diagrams have been indispensable tools for systems modeling and simulation across research, development, and educational fields for several decades. Despite the availability of mature commercial and free software tools, there is a lack of information publicly accessible on algorithms for processing block diagrams that represent dynamical systems and simulate the corresponding models. A gap in the existing literature is the absence of mathematically formal and complete proposals of algorithms for processing block diagrams that are multigraphs containing directed cyclic graphs, and not just simpler directed graphs. The lack of a detailed exposition concerning the practical implementation of such algorithms is also a gap. This gap is likely because the simulation systems based on block diagram descriptions that have become de facto industry standards use proprietary solutions, even if their origins can be traced back to work done in research centers and universities more than seven decades ago. In response to these challenges, this paper summarizes the historical evolution of related paradigms, such as data flow diagrams, signal flow graphs, bond graphs, and block diagrams. We propose a general algorithm for block diagram processing and present an open-source software tool for Python that implements a diagrammatic visual programming interface and the proposed block diagram processing algorithm. The key contributions to the field of systems modeling and simulation can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the exposition of the algorithm formally proving its correctness, offers transparency which facilitates further research and development in the field, enabling academics and professionals to adapt, enhance, or expand upon the existing capabilities of the tool. Secondly, the implementation of a Python library and tool released as an open-source solution for simulating signal processing and dynamical systems through block diagrams by integrating the proposed algorithm capable of efficiently handling multigraph representations, including those with directed cyclic graphs. Ensuring accessibility of the tool to researchers, developers, and educators fosters innovation, research and empowers educators by providing them with a versatile tool that can be used to teach complex systems modeling and simulation concepts in a practical, hands-on manner across various domains, such as control systems, electrical engineering, and computer science."
CELE2022154,SARS-CoV-2 prolonged infection during advanced HIV disease evolves extensive immune escape,"Summary
Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 evolution in specific geographies may help predict properties of the variants that come from these regions. We mapped neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain that evolved over 6 months from ancestral virus in a person with advanced HIV disease in South Africa; this person was infected prior to emergence of the Beta and Delta variants. We longitudinally tracked the evolved virus and tested it against self-plasma and convalescent plasma from ancestral, Beta, and Delta infections. Early virus was similar to ancestral, but it evolved a multitude of mutations found in Omicron and other variants. It showed substantial but incomplete Pfizer BNT162b2 escape, weak neutralization by self-plasma, and despite pre-dating Delta, it also showed extensive escape of Delta infection-elicited neutralization. This example is consistent with the notion that SARS-CoV-2 evolving in individual immune-compromised hosts, including those with advanced HIV disease, may gain immune escape of vaccines and enhanced escape of Delta immunity, and this has implications for vaccine breakthrough and reinfections."

However, challenges such as time constraints, lack of research skills, and insufficient learning resources have also been identified.
Research limitations/implications
This was a small-scale study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
Practical implications
This study expands the use of LS in the ME context by highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing teachers’ PD in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes, and beliefs. It also recommends incorporating diverse international LS models to address the limitations associated with localized models of TPD.
Originality/value
The originality of this study lies in its adoption of an integrated LS model to enhance STEM teachers’ PD in an ME context. The findings of this study further strengthen evidence supporting the positive impact of LS on teachers’ PD."
PARTHASARATHY2021121104,Overcoming wicked problems and institutional voids for social innovation: University-NGO partnerships in the Global South,"This paper argues that, while universities have a crucial role to play in social innovation by democratizing knowledge, fulfilling that role in the Global South requires them to partner with civil society actors such as NGOs. With their history of working with the socially disadvantaged, NGOs have a unique role in clarifying the nature of demand since social innovation must often address ill-formulated “wicked problems”. Similarly, NGOs can fill the “institutional voids” which limit socioeconomic transactions in the Global South. The paper discusses the wicked nature of visual-impairment, which is both widely prevalent and has biopsychosocial attributes i.e., the functional limitations are reinforced by the psychological perceptions of the blind and visually impaired (BVI), and the sociological stigma of impairment. The empirical setting is India where policies for the BVI population are being formulated within a broader framework of social inclusion. The paper investigates how the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB) has taken advantage of state policies to embrace an academic mandate which includes social innovation. Specifically, it explores IIITB's incubation of the NGO Vision Empower, and the partnership that has followed, to overcome the neglect of the BVI in science and mathematics education."
LUO2024103139,The influence of ICT competencies on English digital reading achievement,"Due to the prevalence of information and communication technologies (ICT) among secondary school students and the increasing significance of digital reading, exploring the impact of ICT on students’ digital reading performance in English seems necessary. The current research aimed to examine the effects of ICT competencies factors on secondary school students’ English digital reading performance. Data were obtained from 7703 15-year-old students from three East Asian economies, Macau, Hong Kong, and Singapore, from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 dataset. The results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that students’ ICT literacy was negatively correlated with their English digital reading performance, while the influence of attitudes toward ICT varied across the three East Asia economies. Additionally, males had lower English digital reading achievement, while students with higher socioeconomic status (SES) had higher English digital reading performance."

ECHELARD2020,Medical Student Training in eHealth: Scoping Review,"Background
eHealth is the use of information and communication technologies to enable and improve health and health care services. It is crucial that medical students receive adequate training in eHealth as they will work in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. This trend is especially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it complicates traditional face-to-face medical consultations and highlights the need for innovative approaches in health care.
Objective
This review aims to evaluate the extent and nature of the existing literature on medical student training in eHealth. In detail, it aims to examine what this education consists of, the barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum. This review focuses primarily on some key technologies such as mobile health (mHealth), the internet of things (IoT), telehealth, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Methods
Searches were performed on 4 databases, and articles were selected based on the eligibility criteria. Studies had to be related to the training of medical students in eHealth. The eligibility criteria were studies published since 2014, from a peer-reviewed journal, and written in either English or French. A grid was used to extract and chart data.
Results
The search resulted in 25 articles. The most studied aspect was mHealth. eHealth as a broad concept, the IoT, AI, and programming were least covered. A total of 52% (13/25) of all studies contained an intervention, mostly regarding mHealth, electronic health records, web-based medical resources, and programming. The findings included various barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum.
Conclusions
Trends have emerged regarding the suboptimal present state of eHealth training and barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for optimal training. We recommend that additional studies be conducted on the following themes: barriers, enhancing factors, propositions for optimal training, competencies that medical students should acquire, learning outcomes from eHealth training, and patient care outcomes from this training. Additional studies should be conducted on eHealth and each of its aspects, especially on the IoT, AI, programming, and eHealth as a broad concept. Training in eHealth is critical to medical practice in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. The need for innovative approaches in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlights the relevance of this training."

The concept of “Digital Alchemy” extends this foundation, blending AI-driven methods with traditional healing and sustainable practices to emphasize well-being and environmental consciousness. These advancements culminate in the vision of an AI-augmented kitchen, conceptualized as a collaborative and adaptive space that bridges culinary artistry with algorithmic precision. This research highlights DG's potential as an evolving interdisciplinary field, offering new gastronomy, creativity, and sustainability directions."
HAKIM2024,Digital Gamification Tools to Enhance Vaccine Uptake: Scoping Review,"Background
Gamification has been used successfully to promote various desired health behaviors. Previous studies have used gamification to achieve desired health behaviors or facilitate their learning about health.
Objective
In this scoping review, we aimed to describe digital gamified tools that have been implemented or evaluated across various populations to encourage vaccination, as well as any reported effects of identified tools.
Methods
We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Web of Science Core Collection, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Academic Search Premier, PsycInfo, Global Health, and ERIC for peer-reviewed papers describing digital gamified tools with or without evaluations. We also conducted web searches with Google to identify digital gamified tools lacking associated publications. We consulted 12 experts in the field of gamification and health behavior to identify any papers or tools we might have missed. We extracted data about the target population of the tools, the interventions themselves (eg, type of digital gamified tool platform, type of disease/vaccine, type and design of study), and any effects of evaluated tools, and we synthesized data narratively.
Results
Of 1402 records, we included 28 (2%) peer-reviewed papers and 10 digital gamified tools lacking associated publications. The experts added 1 digital gamified tool that met the inclusion criteria. Our final data set therefore included 28 peer-reviewed papers and 11 digital gamified tools. Of the 28 peer-reviewed papers, 7 (25%) explained the development of the tool, 16 (57%) described evaluation, and 2 (7%) reported both development and evaluation of the tool. The 28 peer-reviewed papers reported on 25 different tools. Of these 25 digital gamified tools, 11 (44%) were web-based tools, 8 (32%) mobile (native mobile or mobile-enabled web) apps, and 6 (24%) virtual reality tools. Overall, tools that were evaluated showed increases in knowledge and intentions to receive vaccines, mixed effects on attitudes, and positive effects on beliefs. We did not observe discernible advantages of one type of digital gamified tool (web based, mobile, virtual reality) over the others. However, a few studies were randomized controlled trials, and publication bias may have led to such positive effects having a higher likelihood of appearing in the peer-reviewed literature.
Conclusions
Digital gamified tools appear to have potential for improving vaccine uptake by fostering positive beliefs and increasing vaccine-related knowledge and intentions. Encouraging comparative studies of different features or different types of digital gamified tools could advance the field by identifying features or types of tools that yield more positive effects across populations and contexts. Further work in this area should seek to inform the implementation of gamification for vaccine acceptance and promote effective health communication, thus yielding meaningful health and social impacts."
HEUNG2025100361,How ChatGPT impacts student engagement from a systematic review and meta-analysis study,"Generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, has been increasingly integrated into education to change student learning experience. Current empirical studies have mixed results on how ChatGPT impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis explores whether and how ChatGPT impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. We used the PRISMA method to select, analyze, and report the results. We screened 766 articles from four databases and identified 17 empirical studies with 1735 students for analysis. We compared the effect on student engagement between ChatGPT-based and non-ChatGPT learning. We found a medium effect size on overall student engagement in ChatGPT-based learning in the random effects model. Our analyses further suggest that ChatGPT-based learning is more effective in fostering student behavioral (medium effective size), cognitive (large effective size), and emotional engagement (medium effective size) than non-ChatGPT learning. Our findings revealed ChatGPT is an effective tool for engaging students in learning. We also suggested three roles ChatGPT plays in fostering student engagement: personalized tutoring, programming and technical assistance, and content generation and collaboration. Our systematic literature review revealed potential risks and results in student disengagement, such as over-reliance."
GROOTHUIJSEN2024100290,AI chatbots in programming education: Students’ use in a scientific computing course and consequences for learning,"Teaching and learning in higher education require adaptation following students' inevitable use of AI chatbots. This study contributes to the empirical literature on students' use of AI chatbots and how they influence learning. The aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. A mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a Mechanical Engineering Master's program at a Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students' grades. Results show that students used ChatGPT for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. While students reported advantages of using ChatGPT, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. Furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from ChatGPT usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. The findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of AI tools. Complex programming assignments remain appropriate in programming education, but pair programming as a didactic approach should be reconsidered in light of the growing use of AI Chatbots."
WEI2021104097,"Assessment of cognitive, behavioral, and affective learning outcomes in massive open online courses: A systematic literature review","This systematic review on massive open online courses (MOOCs) in higher education examined the research on the assessment of learning outcomes based on 65 peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2019. This study aims to investigate the learning outcomes, related instruments, and assessment characteristics of these instruments in MOOCs. Learning outcomes that were examined in the studies that were reviewed concerned cognitive, behavioral, and affective learning outcomes. Twenty-five types of assessment approaches were employed to examine these outcomes and to identify the assessment characteristics. The results indicate that a consideration of the assessment of learning outcomes at the beginning of course design could support the formulation of explicit assessment goals and, in this way, instruct learners to work toward learning outcomes. A combination of knowledge tests and skill tasks can be used to examine cognitive outcomes in a particular MOOC. Outcome-oriented feedback rubrics are beneficial to support learner essay performance and interpretations of the utilization of rubrics could better guide providers to give peer feedback. A variety of behavioral and affective outcomes reflect multiple aspects of participant learning in MOOCs, which might contribute to better understanding by teachers and the provision of learning support. Furthermore, assessment tasks throughout the course may differ in difficulty and complexity, which could align with different levels of learner motivation. The findings provide a holistic picture of learning outcomes and related assessment instruments in current MOOCs. Curriculum designers and teachers could benefit from this study to consider appropriate learning outcome variables and instruments to apply in their MOOC practices. Future research might investigate the motivation of learners to participate in a MOOC and how this changes during a MOOC. This could help MOOC designers and teachers to align how learners are motivated, what they want to learn, and what they actually do learn."
YANG2021104057,Can an online educational game contribute to developing information literate citizens?,"This study began with concerns about mis-/disinformation in the new media environment as we sought ways to combat unreliable information. We developed an online educational game designed to enhance core media and information literacy competencies and to help young adults become information literate citizens. We examined the game's effects on skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills, two of the most important MIL competencies. In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. Before treatment, the participants' perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. After treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. The results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). In addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. These findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource. We extend our discussion to the advantages and limitations of games in fostering learners' abilities to evaluate online information."
ZHAI2023215,A pedagogical framework for mobile learning in science education,"As mobile technology is increasingly used in science teaching, it is crucial to understand how mobile devices can most effectively improve students' learning. We present a three-dimensional analytical framework: integration with learning activities; roles that students and teachers play; and learners' perception of the technology. Based on the framework, four implications are drawn regarding how to better implement mobile technology in science learning: (a) develop learning materials and activities that deeply integrate mobile technology; (b) coordinate students' and teachers' roles; (c) consider affective factors contributing to student achievement; and (d) design mobile learning in light of student gender differences."
TANG2024101602,Exploring the multimodal affordances of digital coding devices in fostering creative thinking in early childhood education,"Digital technologies are increasingly acknowledged for their potential to enrich early childhood learning experiences, particularly in the area of creativity. However, research has tended to focus upon end products and skill development, and little is known about creative development processes. This study sought to explore young children's creative processes as they engaged with three digital coding devices over an eight-week period as part of a Digital Discovery Program. It employed a microethnography to provide nuanced observations of five young children's (aged 4–5 years) interactions and behaviours. Data was collected through approximately 40 hours of video recordings, capturing the dynamic and multimodal aspects of the childrenʼs play and learning experiences. A multimodal interaction analysis was used to examine the multimodal design affordances of each device as mapped against Murcia et al.'s (2020) A-E of Creativity Framework. The findings revealed a clear interplay between digital technologies and various modes of communication, with children demonstrating creativity through their verbal expressions, manipulation of the devices, and spatial understanding of their physical environment. By understanding the multimodal affordances of digital devices aligned with educational frameworks and embracing child-specific definitions of creativity, educators, curriculum designers, policymakers, and researchers can collectively promote creativity and enrich digital learning and play for young children."
CACEFFO2022104324,Children's social interactions within a socioenactive scenario,"New ubiquitous technologies and interaction paradigms can play a key role in facilitating social interaction processes among children. A class of systems named “enactive” aims to support fluid interaction between technology and people via feedback cycles — the effect of technology on the human agent is fed back by the human action on the technology — based on the use of data sensors. We have extended this concept in a long-term project on socioenactive systems, by emphasizing social aspects in the enactive phenomena. In this article, we investigate how a robot-based experience can promote social behavior among children in an educational context. The study was conducted in workshops with 26 children (4–5 years old), organized in two groups. The system scenario used a narrative based on an adaptation of the Little Red Riding Hood tale to investigate children's interaction in playing embodied-based situations. Data captured from video-recorded workshop sessions were analyzed post hoc using the Grounded Theory methods. In total, 26 interaction coding were identified, with a high interrater reliability assessed by Cohen's Kappa (k = 0.84). Our findings indicate that 50.5% of the children's actions were the result of children-children and group-robot interactions, compared to the 38% of children interacting individually with the robot. This indicates children's high degree of embodied peer collaboration and initiative to accomplish the tasks in the proposed scenario. These results contribute to inform the design and construction of future socioenactive systems."
XIA2022104582,A self-determination theory (SDT) design approach for inclusive and diverse artificial intelligence (AI) education,"The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) as a subject in K-12 education is a new and important global strategic initiative, but there is a serious lack of studies in relation to this initiative that address inclusion and diversity of education. Self-determination theory (SDT) can explain student engagement from the needs satisfaction perspective. Therefore, this project aimed to investigate how SDT-based needs support by teachers and student attributes (gender and achievement level) affect AI learning at secondary school level. It adopted a two-study design, with each study using a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design with student needs support from teachers as one factor and one of the student attributes as the other: gender in Study 1 and achievement level in Study 2. In both studies, there were two groups – SDT-based (teacher needs support) and control (without). The analyses revealed that in the SDT-based program, (1) the students had a more positive perception of AI learning and felt that their needs were satisfied, and (2) there were non-significant differences in AI learning between boys and girls and between high and low achievers. The findings suggest that a focus on needs satisfaction could engage boys and girls, and high and low achievers in AI learning. As they become more engaged, they are likely to gain more confidence, feel that the content is more relevant, and become intrinsically motivated to pursue further AI learning."

KWAK2022105541,Nursing students' intent to use AI-based healthcare technology: Path analysis using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,"Background
Marked advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies throughout industries, including healthcare, necessitate a broader understanding their use. Particularly, intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies and its predictors among nursing students, who are prospective healthcare professionals, is required to promote the utilization of AI.
Objective
This study conducted a path analysis to predict nursing students' intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology.
Design
A cross-sectional survey was performed.
Participants
The participants were 210 nursing students from two nursing schools in Korea.
Methods
This study established hypothetical paths for the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and anxiety on intent to use AI-based technologies. Mediation of positive and negative attitudes and facilitating conditions' direct effects on intent to use were examined.
Results
Positive attitude toward AI (β = 0.485, p = .009) and facilitating conditions (β = 0.117, p = .045) predicted intent to use, whereas the path from negative attitude to intent to use was not significant. Performance expectancy, self-efficacy, and effort expectancy predicted positive attitude. Performance expectancy and self-efficacy had a negative effect on the path to negative attitude, whereas anxiety had a positive effect. Facilitating conditions did not significantly predict positive or negative attitude and only directly predicted intent to use. Social influence did not have a significant effect on intent to use.
Conclusions
Intervention programs and other measures should be developed to provide education and information to boost performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and self-efficacy regarding the use of AI to lower anxiety and foster positive attitude toward AI-based health technologies."
PEREIRA2024118029,"Mapping the evolution of seawater desalination research (2000–2024): Bibliometric and co-word analysis of 11,000+ publications","Seawater desalination (SWD) can partially mitigate the increasing freshwater needs globally. Although, SWD is multifaceted and involves processes with environmental and economic challenges, research is often analyzed through Literature Reviews (LRs) in specific contexts that may miss general trends. Bibliometric Analyzes (BAs), however, provide researchers with an overview through Co-occurrence Networks (CNs), Strategic Diagrams (SDs), Thematic Subnetworks (TSs), and Thematic Evolution Diagrams (TEDs). Nevertheless, their use in SWD research has been limited, with minimal attention given to them. Thus, we created a bibliometric dataset, compared it with other BAs, and developed CNs, SDs, TSs, and a TED for SWD. Furthermore, key term searches (Energy, Solar, Reverse Osmosis, Modeling and Optimization, Membrane Distillation, Environmental, Economics, Fouling, Nanofiltration, and Ultrafiltration) and their literature are discussed. Geographical analysis shows China and the US lead SWD research, shifting from process design to membrane fabrication and solar energy. Furthermore, RO remains the leading technique despite high energy demands. Solar desalination shows promise but faces cost and scalability challenges. Environmental and economic concerns are discussed, as well as emerging solutions regarding, solar desalination, blue energy, “blue carbon”, and zero liquid discharge. Research gaps include fouling effects and pretreatment incorporation in optimizations are also highlighted."
CHELLAPPA2024100281,Understanding the perception of design students towards ChatGPT,"The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled language models, such as ChatGPT, have contributed to their growing popularity in education. However, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the perception of ChatGPT, specifically among design students. This study aimed to understand the product design (PD) and user experience design (UXD) students' views on ChatGPT and focused on an Indian university. The study employed a survey research design, utilizing questionnaires as the primary data collection method. The collected data (n = 149) was analyzed using descriptive statistics (i.e., frequency, percentage, average, and standard deviation (SD). Inferential statistics (i.e., one-way ANOVA) was used to understand the significant differences between the programs of study, gender, and academic level. The findings indicate that the students expressed admiration for the capabilities of ChatGPT and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool for their studies. In addition, the students' motivation towards using ChatGPT was moderate. Furthermore, the study observed significant differences between PD and UXD students and differences based on gender and academic level on certain variables. Notably, UXD students reported that ChatGPT does not understand their questions well, and formulating effective prompts for the tool was more challenging than for PD students. Based on the findings, the study recommends how educators should consider integrating ChatGPT into design education curricula and pedagogical practices. The insights aim to contribute to refining the use of ChatGPT in educational settings and exploring avenues for improving its effectiveness, ultimately advancing the field of AI in design education."
COSENZA20201813,The Value of Direct Programming the PID Control Law in MATLAB®,"This work deals with Matlab® and the PID controller. Frequently, codes implementing PID-controlled case studies as tutorial sessions or examples for undergraduate students are available as programmed in Simulink®, the companion toolbox for block modeling, simulation and analysis of dynamic systems. Vice versa, the student, who has access to the source code and directly operates on it in Matlab®, better masters the underlying theoretical background, develops a greater skill related to coding and understands the computational results in a clearer way. This skill can be useful in any work context, especially where Simulink cannot be used. In this article a particular didactic approach is suggested for “hands on” the PID controller and the feedback control system, a simple case study based on the classical continuous bioreactor is built together with and for the class students, both set-point tracking and disturbance rejection at closed loop are covered, the most important outcomes are discussed from a didactical viewpoint. The adopted teaching strategy and the various phases necessary to its effective implementation in Matlab® have been subjected to an assessment procedure during the class of “Modeling and control of process systems”, with encouraging results."
BRANDLE2023e19516,"Self-assessments, attitudes, and motivational orientations towards the use of digital media in teaching a comparison between student teachers of different subject clusters","Findings from research on the education of teachers show that student teachers lack competence in the utilization of digital media and often fail to see the added value in using digital concepts in classrooms. Teacher training institutions are faced with the central challenge of providing student teachers and teachers with adaptive learning opportunities for their competence in digital areas. In the context of various teaching subjects, this raises questions about specific starting points and the actual needs of students, as well as university course offerings. The present study tackles this topic and explores the commonalities and differences between student teachers from three subject clusters: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); language literature arts (LLA); and social sciences (SOCS). The questionnaire-based study examines student teachers' self-assessments of their abilities in terms of digital media, attitudes, and motivational orientations towards the use of digital media in teaching. Group comparisons show that STEM student teachers rate themselves better in competence facets such as technological knowledge, technological content knowledge, and technological pedagogical knowledge, although their attitudes and motivation towards learning with digital media do not differ. Despite the different interrelation effects of investigated influencing factors on motivation depending on subject clusters, the findings suggest the promotion of technological competencies and positive attitudes to increase motivation."
SCANLON2021104291,"Teacher agency and learner agency in teaching and learning a new school subject, Leaving Certificate Computer Science, in Ireland: Considerations for teacher education","A new school subject, Leaving Certificate Computer Science, was introduced in September 2018 into Irish schools in a period of curriculum reform and change. Drawing on concepts of teacher agency and learner agency, and viewed through a figurational sociology lens, this paper explored the realities of teaching LCCS and the role teacher agency and learner agency played in such enactment. Through a case study design, four teachers were interviewed in a focus group semi-structured manner. To delve deeper into the pedagogical approaches used in LCCS, a further one teacher and their nine students were interviewed. The findings highlight an influential relationship (positive and negative, encouraging and discouraging) between teachers’ agentic decisions in their process of achieving teacher agency and the students process of achieving learner agency. The paper offers a figurational viewpoint of the relationship between teacher agency and learner agency through a constructed Figure. We explicitly argue that the responsibility should not be placed on the teacher and student in achieving agency (as a product) but it is a combination of the teacher and the students and the other interdependent relationships within their figurations, alongside contextual factors, and educational social processes, which determine the fluctuation of the process of achieving teacher and learner agency. The paper provides considerations for computer science teacher education."
GUGGEMOS2021106613,Teaching with and teaching about technology – Evidence for professional development of in-service teachers,"The digital transformation has implications for how and what to teach. For the purpose of professional development, the paper at hand presents a conceptual framework for predicting the use of technology as a means and as a content of instruction. It is informed by the TPACK framework and the ‘will, skill, tool’ model. The predictors are Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Technological Collaboration Knowledge (TCoK), and Attitudes. These constructs are measured by newly developed self-assessment instruments. Structural equation modeling using a sample of 212 in-service teachers from commercial schools in German-speaking Switzerland lend support to the soundness of the measurement instrument and the conceptual framework. Overall, 36% of the variance of the use of technology as a means and 45% of the variance for the use as the content of instruction can be explained. Mediation and multigroup analyses, a finite-mixture segmentation, comparisons of competing models, and factor score regression yielded evidence for the robustness of the conceptual framework."
DROZDZEWSKI2024100086,Developing QualNotes: A collaborative and cross-disciplinary ethnography,"Rarely do academics reveal the ‘backend’ of their research; the hours of labour invested into question generation, ethics compliance, transcription, translation, and data analysis, and in our case, coding. Further, when working collaboratively, the conversations that occur between collaborators seldom appear in final publications either. The development of the mobile application QualNotes, provided a productive digital space for collaboration across disciplines. In this paper, we use three vignettes to explicate the ‘backend’ of the development of that mobile application. We chart howour collaborative cross-disciplinary ethnography revealed the generative potential of thinking-with the digital and across disciplinary divides. This paper's contribution is in revealing ‘how’ we work using our disciplinary expertise, but at the same time at the edges of those disciplines too, where we contest, argue, adapt, understand, and, where we learn."
CHANG2024104332,Longitudinal test of the social cognitive model of well-being among Chinese college students,"Since the social cognitive model of well-being in academic\work settings was proposed, more and more studies have supported its validity. Nevertheless, most studies failed to test the temporal precedence of its core variables related to individual career development. Thus, we aimed to test this model among 1512 Chinese college students with a longitudinal perspective. They completed the Career-related Parental Support Inventory, Career Exploration and Decision Self-Efficacy-Brief Decision Scale, Career Commitment Making Scale, and Multiple Happiness Questionnaire three times being a four-month interval. The result indicated that there were more positive predicting associations between career-related parental support, career decision self-efficacy (CDSE), career commitment making, and well-being. Moreover, the longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that T1 career-related parental support was linked to T3 well-being via T2 career commitment making, and that T1 CDSE was linked to T3 well-being via T2 career commitment making. The implications of these findings for further research, practices, and policy-making were discussed."
LOH2025105195,Plugging in at school: Do schools nurture digital skills and narrow digital skills inequality?,"Information and communication technology (ICT) have become indispensable in contemporary schools in post-industrialized countries. Whether schools have succeeded in vesting students with the needed digital skills important in today's highly digitalized societal landscape however remains unclear. In this paper, we examine whether school resources in terms of ICT infrastructure, use of ICT in education, and availability of technical expertise are pertinent to students' digital skillfulness. We also investigate whether such school ICT resources are unevenly distributed among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether students of different socioeconomic backgrounds unevenly benefit from these resources. In doing so, we illuminate school ICT resources' role in the process of intergenerational transmission of inequalities. To test our expectations, we employ ICILS 2018 data on 14,183 students in 751 schools across seven OECD countries. Our findings indicate that schools indeed play a meaningful role in nurturing digital skills, namely through students' use of ICT in educational tasks. We also find that students from more advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds more often attend well ICT-resourced schools, pointing at the uneven distribution of school ICT resources in a way that reflects social reproduction processes. Alongside that, the availability of technical expertise in schools seems particularly fruitful for low-SES students' digital skills development. This evinces that schools compensate for limited ICT skills socialization in the family, pointing at social mobility processes."
MA2025140,Novel multifractal-based classification model for the quality grades of surrounding rock within tunnels,"Understanding the variation patterns of tunnel boring machine (TBM) operational parameters is crucial for assessing engineering geological conditions and quality grades of surrounding rock within tunnels. Studying the multifractal characteristics of the TBM operational parameters can help identify the patterns, but the relevant research has not yet been explored. This paper proposed a novel classification model for quality grades of surrounding rock in TBM tunnels based on multifractal analysis theory. Initially, the statistical characteristics of eight TBM cycle data with different grades of surrounding rock were explored. Subsequently, the method of calculating and analyzing the multifractal characteristic parameters of the TBM operational data was deduced and summarized. The research results showed that the TBM operational parameters of cutterhead torque, total thrust, advance rate, and cutterhead rotation speed have significant multifractal characteristics. Its multifractal dimension, midpoint slope of the generalized fractal spectrum, and singularity strength range can be used to evaluate the surrounding rock grades of the tunnel. Finally, a novel classification model for the tunnel surrounding rocks based on the multifractal characteristic parameters was proposed using the multiple linear regression method, and the model was verified through four TBM cycle data containing different surrounding rock grades. The results showed that the proposed multifractal-based classification model for tunnel surrounding rocks has high accuracy and applicability. This study not only achieves multifractal feature representation and surrounding rock classification for TBM operational parameters but also holds the potential for adaptive adjustment of TBM operational parameters and automated tunneling applications."
LU2024251,Chapter 18 - Multitemporal-spatial-scale flexibility to improve renewable energy accommodation,"The capacity of the wider power system for wind power accommodation is the end result of the synergistic characteristics of the power source (“generation”), the power grid (“grid”), and the load (“load”). Research efforts devoted to wind power accommodation capacity, consequently, ought to take a holistic view of the “generation-grid-load” characteristics. This chapter first introduces the factors that influence wind power accommodation on a multispace and timescale. Then, this section proceeds with a quantification of the flexibility contribution of the power system devices to the grid to establish the flexibility balance at the device level. This chapter is devoted to a holistic study of the wind power accommodation capacity of the Mengxi grid from the electrical output and electricity volume perspectives, taking into account both the general “generation-grid-load” characteristics and the features of wind generation operation, conventional generator operation, load, and grid structure. The topics to be contemplated include wind power accommodation capacity in real-time operation with load and frequency modulation, status quo on the utilization of wind generation resources in the Mengxi grid, the level of impact the constraints have on wind power accommodation, and the dissection of potential improvement initiatives and the pertaining sensitivity analyses."
PARK2025,Development and Validation of the Digital Sensitivity Scale for Adults: Cross-Sectional Observational Study,"Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of modern society, extending digital transformation to daily life and psychological evaluation and treatment. However, the development of competencies and literacy in handling digital technology has not kept pace, resulting in a significant disparity among individuals. Existing measurements of digital literacy were developed before widespread information and communications technology device adoption, mainly focusing on one’s perceptions of their proficiency and the utility of device operation. In the contemporary landscape, digital transformation is evolving within specialized domains, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of digital competencies, attitudes, and proficiency in technology application to bridge the digital divide and ensure digital compliance.
Objective
This study was designed to address the shortcomings of existing scales and formulate a digital sensitivity scale tailored to the requirements of today’s society.
Methods
Initial items of the Yongin Severance Digital Sensitivity Scale (YI-DSS) were collected through a literature review, and expert opinions were gathered to ensure content validity. An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis included 986 adult participants evaluating 14 digital literacy items and 6 digital efficacy items. The Cronbach α confirmed internal consistency reliability, and 2-tailed t tests, ANOVAs, and post hoc tests analyzed demographic differences in digital literacy and efficacy.
Results
A robust 4-factor digital literacy solution was identified: digital application, digital communication, critical thinking, and digital ethics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.891; Bartlett × 2=9829.713; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.782-0.947). A 2-factor solution defined digital efficacy: digital confidence and digital anxiety (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.735; Bartlett × 2=3282.217; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.787-0.912). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for each model (digital literacy model: χ271=676.0, comparative fit index=0.938, Tucker-Lewis index=0.921, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.093; digital efficacy model: χ28=81.9, comparative fit index=0.977, Tucker-Lewis index=0.958, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.097), which indicated a good fit. The YI-DSS also showed high correlation with the previously developed Digital Literacy Scale (r=0.809; P<.001).
Conclusions
The YI-DSS, as a self-assessment tool, has the potential to bridge the generational information gap by promoting acceptance, motivation, and adaptation to digital technology. Furthermore, given the remote nature of digital therapeutics, an individual’s familiarity with required technologies and digital communication strongly influences their acceptance of digital treatments and the efficacy thereof. This scale can play a pivotal role in enhancing compliance with digital therapeutics by preemptively assessing individuals’ technological literacy and competency."

OCONNOR2023107963,Exploring the impact of augmented reality on student academic self-efficacy in higher education,"This study develops and empirically tests a conceptual model comprising eight hypotheses that focus on the impact of Augmented Reality (AR) on student academic self-efficacy. A controlled experiment was conducted, followed by an online questionnaire with 65 students. Partial Least Square (PLS) Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is used to assess and test the model. The results show that student cognitive strategies impact student perception and engagement with technology and learning tasks, with AR positively impacting student academic self-efficacy in higher education. Interestingly, neither the learning space nor the students' perception of task value was shown to impact their intention to use AR. Instead, it was the characteristics of the technology itself which encouraged adoption. The study's findings reinforce the need to (1) teach and facilitate effective cognitive strategies among third level students and (2) identify and overcome negative cognitive strategies that harm student self-efficacy and engagement."
NETO2025103459,"Investigating crossmodal correspondences between vibrotactile stimuli, colour, and emotions","There is an increasing interest in Human–computer Interaction in multisensory interactive systems, creating a need to deepen our understanding of how multiple sensory modalities relate to and affect each other. We extend prior research on crossmodal correspondences by investigating colour and emotional associations with pure vibrotactile stimuli. We asked 32 participants to assign colour properties (hue and brightness) and emotional categories (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) to stimuli of varying amplitude and angular frequency. We found that perceptions of pleasure and arousal increased with amplitude and angular frequency, but negative and relaxing emotional states were not able to convey. We also found associations between vibrotactile stimuli and colour properties. High amplitude stimuli were linked to warm colours and darker shades, while low amplitude was associated with brighter shades and greater variance in hue. We finish by discussing the causal mechanisms of crossmodal correspondences and contribute a design space for creating multisensory experiences."
ARSEVEN2025101850,Critical literacy in artificial intelligence assisted writing instruction: A systematic review,"This systematic review aims to examine the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI)- assisted writing instruction and critical literacy skills of K-12 students. As a result of searching Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and EBSCO databases in accordance with the criteria determined, 15 studies were included in the analysis. As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field."
TASGIN2023101400,The mediating role of critical thinking dispositions between secondary school student's self-efficacy and problem-solving skills,"This research examines whether critical thinking dispositions significantly mediate secondary school students’ self-efficacy and problem-solving skills. The sample of the study consisted of a total of 304 secondary school students. Study data were obtained by using the “Problem-Solving Skills Perception Scale for Secondary School Students”, “Critical Thinking Disposition Scale for Secondary School Students”, and “Middle School Self-Efficacy Scale.” It was examined whether the scores of the variables in the study were normally distributed. After it was understood that the data were normally distributed, the analyses were conducted. The relationships between the variables were analyzed with Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis and significant relationships were found between the variables. Then, a mediation model was established to analyze whether critical thinking has a mediating role in the relationship between middle school students' self-efficacy and problem-solving skills. The significance of the indirect effect in this mediation model was tested by the bootstrapping procedure. In the study, it was concluded that all variables were positively and significantly related to each other and critical thinking significantly mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and problem-solving skills in secondary school students."
WU2024104376,Validating the AI-assisted second language (L2) learning attitude scale for Chinese college students and its correlation with L2 proficiency,"The positive impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on second language (L2) learning is well-documented. An individual's attitude toward AI significantly influences its adoption. Despite this, no specific scale has been designed to measure this attitude, particularly in the Chinese context. To address this gap, our study aims to construct the AI-Assisted L2 Learning Attitude Scale for Chinese College Students (AL2AS-CCS) and evaluate its reliability, validity, and relationship with L2 proficiency. Our research comprises two phases, each involving separate samples. In Phase One (Sample 1: n = 379), we conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factor structure of the AL2AS-CCS. The resulting two-factor structure consists of 12 items, categorized into cognitive and behavioral components. In Phase Two (Sample 2: n = 429), we performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the factor structure and assess model fit. CFA in Sample 2 confirmed the factor structure and demonstrated a good model fit. Additionally, the AL2AS-CCS exhibited high criterion validity, internal consistency, and cross-gender invariance. Our findings suggest that the AL2AS-CCS is a valid measurement tool for assessing Chinese college students' attitude toward AI-assisted L2 learning. Moreover, Chinese college students were discovered to maintain a moderately positive attitude toward AI-assisted L2 learning. Additionally, a positive correlation was identified between this attitude and their L2 proficiency."
SANUSI2024100212,"Stakeholders’ insights on artificial intelligence education: Perspectives of teachers, students, and policymakers","The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) as a subject into K-12 education worldwide is still in its early stages and undoubtedly needs further investigation. There is limited effort on understanding policymakers, teachers and students’ viewpoints on AI learning within the school system. This study gathered the thoughts of key stakeholders, including policymakers, higher education and K-12 teachers, and students in Nigeria, to understand their conceptions, concerns, and dispositions, with the aim of aiding the implementation of AI in schools. We further explored the needs of the diverse stakeholders, how they can be supported and juxtaposed their views to identify their priorities and how their opinions combined could give a holistic approach to the effective implementation of AI education. This research employed a qualitative methodology using semi-structured interviews as the means of data collection. The thematic analysis of the interview data from the 21 participants indicates their conceptions, what they considered the priorities for including AI in the school system, concerns and support needed to implement AI in schools. The findings of this study contribute to the ongoing conversation on how to effectively integrate AI into school curriculum."
SHAHID2022100340,Technology-enhanced support for children with Down Syndrome: A systematic literature review,"This paper presents a systematic literature review on technology-enhanced support for children with Down Syndrome and young people who match the mental age of children considered neurotypical (NT). The main aim is threefold: to (1) explore the field of digital technologies designed to support children with Down Syndrome, (2) identify technology types, contexts of use, profiles of individuals with Down Syndrome, methodological approaches, and the effectiveness of such supports, and (3) draw out opportunities for future research in this specific area. A systematic literature review was conducted on five search engines resulting in a set of 703 articles, which were screened and filtered in a systematic way until they were narrowed to a corpus of 65 articles for further analysis. The synthesis identify several key findings: (1) there is diversity of technology supports available for children with Down Syndrome targeting individual capabilities, (2) overlapping definitions of technology makes it difficult to place technology supports in individual categories rather than subsets of a broader term, (3) the average sample size remained small for participants in the studies, making it difficult to draw solid conclusions on the effectiveness of the related interventions, (4) the distribution of papers indicates that this is an emerging area of research and is starting to build body of knowledge, and (5) there are limited studies on newer emerging technologies which requires further investigation to explore their potential."
ZHANG2024105165,Pedagogical agent design for K-12 education: A systematic review,"Pedagogical agents (PAs) are increasingly being integrated into educational technologies. Although previous reviews have examined the impact of PAs on learning and learning-related outcomes, it still remains unclear what specific design features, social cues, and other contextual elements of PA implementation can optimize the learning process. These questions are even more prevalent with regards to the K-12 population, as most reviews to date have largely focused on post-secondary learners. To address this gap in the literature, we systematically review empirical studies around the design of PAs for K-12 learners. After reviewing 1374 studies for potential inclusion, we analyzed 44 studies that met our inclusion criteria using Heidig and Clarebout's (2011) frameworks. Our findings showed that learners had preferences for specific types of PAs. While these preferences were not always associated with increased learning outcomes, there is a lack of research specifically investigating the intersection of perceptions and learning. Our results also showed that pedagogical strategies that are effective for human teachers were effective when used by PAs. We highlight what specific design features instructional designers can use to design PAs for K-12 learners and discuss promising research directions based on the extant work in the field."
BORSATTO2024100160,Aligning community outreach initiatives with SDGs in a higher education institution with artificial intelligence,"Purpose
Considering the role of community outreach of a Higher Education Institution (HEI) in promoting sustainable regional development, based on the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda, the present study aims to verify, with the usage of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool, the alignment of community outreach actions of an HEI to the SDGs and identify its actions with the greatest impact.
Design/methodology/approach
The study is descriptive through a case study at a university in Brazil. Documentary analysis was carried out using data on more than 15,000 community outreach projects developed from 2009 to 2022, using natural language processing (NLP). In addition to the descriptive aspects, combining NLP with statistical techniques allowed us to discuss the alignment between community outreach projects and the SDGs from a longitudinal perspective.
Findings
The results demonstrated that the main SDGs in community outreach actions are SDG 17: Partnerships and Means of Implementation; SDG 4: Quality Education; SDG 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production and SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. These results are prominent because community outreach aims to establish a dialogical relationship between society and the university, conceiving the exchange of knowledge based on the actions developed and sharing knowledge with those involved in community extension.
Originality
The use of AI technologies to identify and monitor data on community outreach actions in HEI towards the SDGs, and to propose ways to share this information with internal and external stakeholders of the institution."
ALONSODECASTRO2023e22331,Systematic review of Erasmus+ projects labelled as good practice and related to e-learning and ICT: Some case studies,"This article focuses on the methodology applied for the review of European educational projects, within the framework of Erasmus+, labelled as good practices and that are related to electronic learning or the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education. In addition, some of the projects that have passed all the research phases and have proven to be sustainable over time are analyzed. The projects presented represent different educational sectors and propose learning systems through ICT with the involvement of students and/or teachers.

RABELLOMESTRE2025101775,Creative Learning - A Configurative Review of Features and Practices,"The idea that learning and creativity are interrelated has experienced a renaissance in the last 20 years. Fashionable and suggestive, the concept of ""creative learning"" has found traction in educational policy and in progressive classrooms across the globe. This configurative review explores how the concept of creative learning has been understood and put into practice across 112 education studies since 2010. Specifically, the review addresses two questions: First, what are the constitutive features and actions that characterize creative learning? Second, what are the overarching themes that can be identified in the literature? The study reports on the findings of an extensive thematic analysis, which indicated four general approaches to creative learning: namely (1) creative agency over learning, (2) affective and embodied pathways, (3) relational ecologies, and (4) learning by doing and making. The review concludes with a discussion of each of these themes, deriving from them a set of practical recommendations and a revised definition of creative learning."
BAYKAL2021100256,What FabLearn talks about when talking about reflection — A systematic literature review,"FabLearn is a venue for researchers and practitioners within computing, design and making in education where reflective practices are an integral part. This paper presents a systematic literature review on the use of the term reflection in FabLearn research. With this review, we provide an answer to the questions (1) what reflection means in FabLearn research, (2) how these reflections are stimulated and scaffolded in practice (i.e., teachers/facilitators and students/participants), and (3) what types of concerns or subject matters take place in reflective practices. The review is conducted in FabLearn US and Europe proceedings between 2014–2019, and resulted in 68 papers included in the analysis. The findings show that FabLearn research need to develop solid theoretical groundings and frameworks as guidelines to scaffold students’ reflection, and more in-depth understanding of reflection to investigate and carry out a more comprehensive conceptualization of the term."
LAVALLE2025100889,Study of gender perspective in STEM degrees and its relationship with video games,"At present, even though gender equality is an important matter of public interest, there are still areas in higher education where male presence is overwhelming. We refer to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) studies in general and Computer Engineering in particular where there is only 16% of female presence in Spain. This fact made us think about the reason for this inequality. We attempted to answer such questions by means of a survey filled out by 138 students of STEM university degrees. Thanks to this survey, we have been able to understand the motivations and opinions of the students of STEM degrees regarding gender perspective. Our study highlights the possible influence of computer and video game use on enrollment in STEM degrees. Furthermore, it points out the differences between men and women in computer science skills before they start their studies. The answers provided by the surveyed women showed a correlation between women who play video games and those who get better grades. In addition, women who play video games feel more integrated into STEM degrees. Finally, differences were found in gender perspective between the male and female participants."

SINGH2023e1372,"The met and unmet health needs for HIV, hypertension, and diabetes in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: analysis of a cross-sectional multimorbidity survey","Summary
Background
The convergence of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases in South Africa is challenging to health systems. In this analysis, we assessed the multimorbidity health needs of individuals and communities in rural KwaZulu-Natal and established a framework to quantify met and unmet health needs for individuals living with infectious and non-communicable diseases.
Methods
We analysed data collected between May 25, 2018, and March 13, 2020, from participants of a large, community-based, cross-sectional multimorbidity survey (Vukuzazi) that offered community-based HIV, hypertension, and diabetes screening to all residents aged 15 years or older in a surveillance area in the uMkhanyakude district in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data from the Vukuzazi survey were linked with data from demographic and health surveillance surveys with a unique identifier common to both studies. Questionnaires were used to assess the diagnosed health conditions, treatment history, general health, and sociodemographic characteristics of an individual. For each condition (ie, HIV, hypertension, and diabetes), individuals were defined as having no health needs (absence of condition), met health needs (condition that is well controlled), or one or more unmet health needs (including diagnosis, engagement in care, or treatment optimisation). We analysed met and unmet health needs for individual and combined conditions and investigated their geospatial distribution.
Findings
Of 18 041 participants who completed the survey (12 229 [67·8%] were female and 5812 [32·2%] were male), 9898 (54·9%) had at least one of the three chronic diseases measured. 4942 (49·9%) of these 9898 individuals had at least one unmet health need (1802 [18·2%] of 9898 needed treatment optimisation, 1282 [13·0%] needed engagement in care, and 1858 [18·8%] needed a diagnosis). Unmet health needs varied by disease; 1617 (93·1%) of 1737 people who screened positive for diabetes, 2681 (58·2%) of 4603 people who screened positive for hypertension, and 1321 (21·7%) of 6096 people who screened positive for HIV had unmet health needs. Geospatially, met health needs for HIV were widely distributed and unmet health needs for all three conditions had specific sites of concentration; all three conditions had an overlapping geographical pattern for the need for diagnosis.
Interpretation
Although people living with HIV predominantly have a well controlled condition, there is a high burden of unmet health needs for people living with hypertension and diabetes. In South Africa, adapting current, widely available HIV care services to integrate non-communicable disease care is of high priority.

AZIZ2023112,BOOK4WASH: Mobile car wash booking system,"The need for car wash services nowadays is increasing since most car owners are too busy to wash their automobiles themselves. Nowadays, car wash facilities give numerous car wash or car detailing services such as foam washing, waxing, and polishing, which are handy for consumers. However, there are certain limits revealed that customers must queue up for a long period till their turn. During busy hours, clients could have to wait for a few hours, which wastes customers’ time. Besides, it is problematic for people living in apartments because there is no place for them to wash their cars. Other than that, most individuals are frightened to leave their homes because worried about the COVID-19 virus. Hence, the recommended solutions in this application can address the issues by integrating the booking system while being online. The Mobile Application Development Life Cycle (MADLC) has been used as a methodology for the entire research, including all phases except the deployment and maintenance phases. The purpose of this research is to make it more convenient for the user by providing door-to-door vehicle wash services at shopping malls, parking lots, places of employment, residential driveways, and other locations."

ZHANG2025100978,The paradox of self-efficacy and technological dependence: Unraveling generative AI's impact on university students' task completion,"In the era of proliferating artificial intelligence (AI) technology, generative AI is reshaping educational landscapes, prompting a critical examination of its influence on students' learning processes and their self-efficacy amid concerns over growing technological dependence. This study investigates the nuanced relationship between generative AI use and university students' self-efficacy and technological dependence, illuminating the underlying paradoxes and implications for inclusive education practices. Through a survey of 348 university students, with 200 valid responses analyzed, we uncover the direct and indirect impacts of generative AI usage frequency on AI dependence. Our findings reveal a paradoxical effect: enhanced AI usage significantly amplifies students' confidence and efficiency in learning, yet simultaneously intensifies their dependence on AI. This dual impact both supports and complicates the incorporation of AI technologies into educational settings, underscoring the need for a balanced approach to leveraging AI in teaching and learning. Our study underscores the critical importance of a nuanced understanding of AI's role in education. It highlights the necessity of crafting an educational landscape where technology augments learning processes without compromising independent learning capabilities. By navigating the complex interplay between technological advancement and educational inclusivity, our findings guide the development of AI-assisted learning environments that are not only effective but also equitable and accessible."
GAO2022101097,Understanding student teachers’ collaborative problem solving competency: Insights from process data and multidimensional item response theory,"Collaborative problem solving competency is one of the core competencies that digital citizens should possess in the 21st century. There has been a growing research interest in examining learners’ collaborative problem solving competency in collaborative learning tasks. However, there are still limited research studies on the composition of collaborative problem solving competency, especially considering the interactive, interdependent, and periodic characteristics of collaboration. By using the procedural data generated in collaboration, the multidimensional item response theory and the hierarchical linear model, the present study examined the characteristics of student teachers’ collaborative problem solving competency in two real online learning tasks in a sample of 42 student teachers. The results suggested that the bigram-indicator may be more representative of student teachers’ collaborative problem solving competency than the unigram-indicator. Moreover, student teachers’ collaborative problem solving competency in the two online learning tasks was a five-factor structure. In addition, the social and cognitive dimensions of collaborative problem solving competency were unfolded orderly in collaborative tasks. Finally, the conclusions, implications, limitations, and future research directions were discussed."
XIAO2025126531,An assessment framework of higher-order thinking skills based on fine-tuned large language models,"Proficiency in higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) is essential for 21st-century students to effectively address complex challenges. Assessing HOTS can increase students’ awareness of their cognitive abilities and promote the development of advanced cognitive skills. This study proposes an automated assessment approach for HOTS, to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on experts and are often short-term. The exceptional knowledge base and advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted academics to extend their application to various areas, where they outperform models limited to specific domains. Inspired by this, we propose a framework for the automated assessment of HOTS using LLMs, called LLM4HA. The framework consists of two distinct models: a text-based exercise classification model constructed from pre-trained BERT, and a student HOTS assessment model based on response data, constructed by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. To validate the performance of our framework, we established a classification rule based on Bloom’s taxonomy for exercise classification. We collected 43,070 exercise data points from 181 undergraduate students, from which exercise text data and response data were obtained. The results demonstrate that LLM4HA successfully classifies exercises and assesses students’ HOTS. The BERT-based classification model outperforms ChatGPT-4, and the LLMs-based fine-tuning model significantly outperforms the RNNs-based model. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify the causes of this outcome. The findings indicate that the robust knowledge base and sophisticated architecture may be crucial for achieving optimal performance in the HOTS assessment task. The implementations are available at https://github.com/xxiongGG/LLM4HA-mian-0302."
XIE2025126371,Using LLM-supported lecture summarization system to improve knowledge recall and student satisfaction,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are a useful summarization tool for helping students remember the main ideas and central claims of a lecture. However, due to limitations in current techniques, they are unable to deal with lecture’s complex structures, which contain multiple knowledge themes. To address this issue, we proposed an original theme-based lecture summary (TLS) system that combines graph-based theme segmentation algorithms and LLMs, consisting of data preparation, theme segmentation, summary generation, and consistency evaluation stages. To assess the effectiveness of the system, an education intervention was implemented using a mixed-methods research design. Forty-six undergraduate students took part in an authentic lecture context for eight weeks. The quantitative study used a 2 × 2 factorial design, with intervention conditions including lecture type (conceptual vs. procedural) and TLS-generated summaries (with vs. without). Then, eight of the participants were chosen for a focus-group interview to learn about student satisfaction. The study finds that: 1) TLS-generated summaries have a significant positive influence on knowledge recall; 2) lecture type has no effect on the intervention outcomes of TLS-generated summaries, regardless of whether it is conceptually or procedurally oriented; and 3) TLS-generated summaries can increase student satisfaction. The current study broadens the use of LLMs in authentic educational settings to promote student success."
ELLERTON2022100975,On critical thinking and content knowledge: A critique of the assumptions of cognitive load theory☆,"How critical thinking is understood has a logical impact on pedagogy and curriculum design in a critical thinking education. If critical thinking is seen as a complex mix of knowledge, skills and dispositions that can be articulated and made an object of study in themselves, then there is scope for intentional and explicit targeting of such things. If, however, critical thinking is seen as a general skill more or less impermeable to pedagogical influence and best realised through the development of content knowledge, then an explicit focus on developing thinking skills is misplaced and potentially distracting. The latter view is that of cognitive load theory (CLT), a theoretical framing of thinking and learning that has gained traction in education including with practitioners. This paper will explore some of the assumptions of CLT and show that they are either (1) in error, (2) vaguely or confusingly expressed and/or (3) the conclusions drawn within the theory are often errors of inference. Moreover, I point out that important educational research that weakens the claims of CLT is often not engaged with or addressed."
KONG2025105249,The role of perceived teacher support in students’ attitudes towards and flow experience in programming learning: A multi-group analysis of primary students,"Programming education has become essential in primary schools, yet students' perceptions vary significantly across different achievement levels. While teacher support is crucial for learning, little is known about how it influences students' attitudes and flow experience across different achievement groups in programming education. This study examined the interrelationships among perceived teacher support, students' attitudes, and flow experience in programming learning across different achievement levels. Data were collected through surveys from 549 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Students were categorised into three groups based on their programming achievement levels: above-average, average, and below-average. A multi-group mediation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between variables. The above-average group showed significantly more positive perceptions across all variables than other groups. Students’ attitudes mediated the relationship between perceived teacher support and flow experience differently across achievement groups. The findings highlight the importance of differentiated teacher support strategies across achievement tiers and suggest that fostering positive attitudes towards programming is crucial for all achievement levels, particularly through enhancing the perceived usefulness of programming."
MORCH2023100697,Makerspace activities in a school setting: Top-down and bottom-up approaches for teachers to leverage pupils' making in science education,"This article addresses the opportunities and challenges of turning a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classroom into a makerspace for hands-on experimentation with digital tools and materials in science education. In this qualitative case study, over a period of 16 weeks, video data were collected during making activities in an advanced placement science course with 19 pupils aged 12–16 years, and interviews were conducted. We combined thematic and interaction analyses of empirical data and identified three themes: 1) engagement and spontaneous concepts, 2) programming and making physical objects, and 3) subject integration. Our conceptual framework for the analyses integrated two features of the Vygotskian sociocultural theory of learning: concept development as a dialectical process of scientific and everyday concepts and the “tool and symbol” duality. Our findings show that both top-down and bottom-up approaches to integrating school subjects into a makerspace were effective but underused. We illustrate this by mapping pupils' shared understanding in a sociotechnical space, visualized as a process of “rising to the concrete”, which may require teacher's scaffolding at different levels of abstraction and use of instructional materials in different modalities."
PIVETTI2020e05160,Educational Robotics for children with neurodevelopmental disorders: A systematic review,"This paper aims to provide a critical review of the studies dealing with Educational Robotics for children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders. We aimed to investigate whether in the literature there is a sound evidence that activities with robots improve the abilities and performances of children with special needs. This paper explores the methodological aspects as well as the outcomes of the selected studies to provide a clear picture of the state-of-the-art on this topic. After a systematic search in the online database via keyword searches, 15 scientific papers were included in this review. We applied strict selection criteria limiting our review only to papers reporting educational robotics activities with children (from 3 up to 19 years old) with a diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders, in which the children had the opportunity to somehow program the behaviours of real robots. The majority of experiences showed improvements in the participants' performance or abilities, their engagement and involvement, communication/interaction with peers, during robotics sessions. Some studies reported mixed results, calling for the need to carefully design the objective and the related activities of each experience."

ALYASIN2022170047,Novel hybrid classification model for multi-class imbalanced lithology dataset,"Deep learning methods and applications assist geologists in predicting and identifying lithologies in different surveys, hence lowering operational costs and uptime. This allows accurate data analysis and completion of scientific research on data obtained at geologically different places. This study used 4 lithologies datasets with high dimensionality and multiclass imbalance problems for analysis and classification. The imbalance of data classification is one of the most important problems facing current data analysis. Data imbalance can considerably influence classification performance, especially when dealing with other difficulty variables such as the presence of overlapping class distributions. This impact is especially obvious in multi-class conditions when mutual imbalance relations across classes complicate matters even further. Moreover, the problem of high dimensionality can lead to increased computing complexity and overfitting, and thus these issues can affect classification performance. To overcome these problems, we developed a new hybrid deep learning multi-class imbalanced learning method that combines Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to resample the data, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most useful predictive features. Finally, we believe that our developments can help improve geology research by providing accurate classification and rapid answers about interpreting data obtained in various study areas."
MARCHIORI2025262,Developing heat stress training assessments: A training-driven methodology approach to enhance safety in the construction industry,"Introduction: The construction industry, characterized by its hazardous working conditions, particularly in extreme environments such as high temperatures, presents significant challenges for construction workers in mitigating heat-related illnesses (HRIs).

MASRYHERZALLAH2025100377,Technological self-efficacy and sense of coherence: Key drivers in teachers' AI acceptance and adoption,"This study investigates the factors influencing teachers within the Israeli education system toward the adaptations of artificial intelligence (AI) in teaching by examining the roles of technological self-efficacy (TSE) and a sense of coherence (SOC). Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a sample of 200 Arab and Jewish teachers in Israel completed online questionnaires. The findings indicated a positive attitude towards AI among teachers. We found a significant positive correlation between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and positive attitude towards AI. TSE fully mediated the relationship between attitude towards AI and adoption intentions AI, while a SOC partially mediated the relationship between TSE and teachers' attitude towards AI. The findings underscore the importance of developing TSE and fostering a SOC among teachers as part of the AI implementation process in the education system. The findings offer a new understanding of AI technology adoption processes in education by incorporating psychological variables into the TAM framework and providing practical insights for decision-makers in the Israeli education system and beyond."
NG2022100054,Using digital story writing as a pedagogy to develop AI literacy among primary students,"Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is widely recognized as a new set of competencies that people use AI effectively and ethically in everyday life. In K-12 education, educators have started to employ different pedagogical strategies to foster students' AI literacy. Using digital story writing (DSW) in the classroom is an effective inquiry-based pedagogical approach to address literacy development by improving language and technological abilities across disciplines. This study recruited 82 primary students in Hong Kong to attend a three-month DSW journey to learn AI and completed a knowledge test at the end of the program. Among the students, 16 best-achieving students were further invited to participate in artefact-based interviews, and we further analysed their work to understand how they formulate AI understandings. It is found that the participating students were able to propose an authentic scenario, apply their new knowledge of AI and think up meaningful AI-driven solutions in their digital stories. Furthermore, we examined students' DSW process in terms of inquiry-based pedagogical cycle (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion) to demonstrate how they learn AI. Overall, DSW as an inquiry could effectively foster students' AI literacy in using and applying AI knowledge to solve real-life problems, far beyond merely knowing and understanding related concepts. We suggest that using DSW as a pedagogy has the potential to support students to scaffold students’ AI understanding, particularly for young children."
LANGER2023105230,Ethical considerations in child-robot interactions,"Social robots hold promise in augmenting education, rehabilitative care, and leisure activities for children. Despite findings suggesting various benefits of social robot use in schools, clinics, and homes, stakeholders have voiced concerns about the potential social and emotional effects of children engaging in long-term interactions with robots. Given the challenges of conducting large long-term studies of child-robot interaction (CRI), little is known about the impact of CRI on children’s socio-emotional development. Here we summarize the literature on predictions and expectations of teachers, parents, therapists, and children regarding the effects of CRI on children’s socio-emotional functioning and skill building. We then highlight the limited body of empirical research examining how CRI affects children’s social behavior and emotional expression, and we provide a summary of available questionnaires for measuring socio-emotional constructs relevant to CRI. We conclude with design recommendations for research studies aimed at better understanding the effects of CRI, before social robots become ubiquitous. This review is relevant to researchers, educators, roboticists, and clinicians interested in designing and using social robots with developmental populations."
SCHERER2023324,Accountability for the future? International testing and future directions,"International large-scale assessments (ILSAs), such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), have become vehicles to accountability in educational systems around the world. While these assessments bear great potential to inform educational research, practice, and policy-making, they have several limitations and constraints, especially concerning the level of inferences that can be drawn.

DENG2025105224,Does ChatGPT enhance student learning? A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies,"Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has generated excitement and concern in education. While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative AI integration in educational practice."
CANNON2023497,Digital media arts and critical media education: an alchemy of creative literacy practices,"This chapter addresses the importance of critical and creative media education across the curriculum from the primary years of learning onwards. The reading and writing skills associated with print literacy are insufficient for meaningful social participation in the digital age. Digital media production and creative media arts, in this instance through film, drama and animation production, are seen as central dimensions of a wider and more relevant conceptualization of literacy. School curricula and expressive practices must evolve to accommodate intermedial communicative modes, digital meaning-making and the complex media and moving image landscapes in which most children and young people in developed countries are immersed."

However, programming concepts and syntax are extremely abstract. We developed an augmented reality (AR)-based learning system to make programming concepts tangible. Specifically, we adopted a high interactive AR mode that allows students to freely assemble puzzle cards to compare various 3D animated programming results. This study adopted a quasi-experimental design and recruited 98 fifth graders as participants. Three groups, named the high interactive AR, low interactive AR, and the traditional learning (control) groups, were formed. The results revealed that the AR-based instruction, especially the high interactive AR mode, helped the students improve their programming achievements, gain higher learning motivation, reduce their cognitive load, and acquire a high degree of technology acceptance. The interview data mainly showed that the students in the high interactive group attained more positive experiences of assembling puzzle cards to learn programming. Our study suggests that using AR technology alone did not facilitate learning motivation, although it did produce better programming achievements compared to the traditional learning. A high interactive design such as “puzzle cards” is vital for arousing higher motivation, which can in turn facilitate a more in-depth understanding of programming logic."
OZAYDINLIK2024101687,Online Design Thinking Instruction and changes in pre-service teachers’ self-perceptions of Design Thinking and reflective thinking: A mixed-method study,"It is an undeniable fact that Design Thinking (DT) and Reflective Thinking (RT) skills are among the qualities that must be possessed by every individual, especially teachers, who are one of the most important pillars in achieving the goals of curriculums, in the world of education where digital technology has become a great power. This makes it necessary to carry out studies to develop teacher training programs in this direction. The purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of DT training on the DT and RT tendencies of pre-service teachers and to elicit the opinions of pre-service teachers on this process. The study group consisted of a total of 44 s-year pre-service teachers, 32 female and 12 male, attending the Department of Primary Teaching in a state university. The study employed an embedded design, one of the mixed methods, and qualitative research was embedded within quantitative research. An quasi-experimental method was used in the quantitative dimension of the study, and the case study design was used in the qualitative dimension. In the experimental dimension the study, data were collected by using the “Design Thinking Scale”, “Reflective Thinking Level Determination Scale” and a “Personal Information Form” developed by the researcher. The qualitative data of the study were collected by using a semi-structured interview form prepared by the researcher. At the end of the study, it is believed that online DT instruction may have an impact on pre-service teachers' both DT and RT tendencies, and that pre-service teachers with low reflection and critical reflection tendencies may have benefited more from online DT instruction compared to those with higher tendencies."
PARK2020116,Exploring the Explicit Teaching Strategies in STEAM Program of Climate Change,"The study introduces exemplary explicit teaching strategies as enacted by a middle school STEAM teacher. Through a 10-lesson climate change STEAM program, data were collected to explore explicit teaching strategies using O-TOP (Oregon Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparation [OCEPT] Teaching Observation Protocol) and NGSS 8 Practices (Next Generation Science Standards). Data from teacher interviews and class observations were also used to identify and describe how this STEAM teacher offered students opportunities to solve real problems in their community. Examples demonstrating three stages of STEAM education: understanding context presentation, performing creative design, and experiencing emotional touch are provided. We argue STEAM programs should be presented with more realistic issues arising from the community students belong to and that explicit teaching strategies should give students the opportunity to achieve core competencies and scientific literacy. Our study offers implications about the need for systemic teacher training and professional development for STEAM education."
MOUNDRIDOU2024100277,Generative AI tools as educators’ assistants: Designing and implementing inquiry-based lesson plans,"This study investigates the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) tools into educational practices, specifically focusing on the design of Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) lesson plans. Based on a particular IBL framework that synthesizes the core attributes of IBL by combining the strengths of various models, the study explores educators' potential utilization of GenAI tools across the framework's phases. Among other capabilities, GenAI tools were examined for their support in content creation, assessment and feedback processes, as well as in the design of learning activities and lesson plans. This examination informed the classification of GenAI tools in this study, organizing them according to their potential utility for educators. These groups and subgroups of tools were then aligned with each phase of the IBL framework, demonstrating their role in achieving the objectives of each phase. Several practical examples across different grade levels and disciplines were also provided to highlight their prospective use. The systematic classification of GenAI tools introduced in this study fills a notable gap in the literature, thus making a valuable contribution to the field of GenAI in education. Additionally, by demonstrating how this classification can be applied as educators craft and deliver IBL lesson plans, the study further contributes by providing guidance on the effective use of these tools in real-world educational contexts."

CHU2022100091,Artificial intelligence-based robots in education: A systematic review of selected SSCI publications,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the application of AI robots (Artificial Intelligence-based robots) for instruction has become an attractive research topic. Numerous studies have shown that AI robots may provide new opportunities for learning designs in school settings or professional training. However, there is no review examining the role and research foci of AI-Robots in Education (AIRE) research. This study therefore explored the research trends of AIRE by conducting a systematic review of SSCI (Social Sciences Citation Index) journal articles published in the Web of Science (WoS). The study analyzed the participants, duration of the studies, learning environments, application domains, data analysis, evaluations of learners' performance, learning strategies, roles of AI-robots, and research issues. The research findings are concluded as follows: (1) The countries of Canada, Chile, and South Korea invested in AIRE research early, and focused on students' learning performance and learning behavior. (2) Most AIRE research focuses on research targets under the age of 13 and completed experiments within 4 weeks in a physical environment. Most AIRE research has been applied in the disciplines of Language and Science, and problem-solving related strategies and mixed strategies are the most commonly used strategies. (3) AI-robots are often applied and regarded as tutees or tutors. Regardless of what the AI-robot's role is, learning performance is the most widely focused variable in AIRE research. Furthermore, attitudes, opinions of learners or learning perceptions and learning behavior are other frequently discussed themes. To sum up, this study makes several recommendations for AIRE research for educators, researchers, and policy makers in higher education settings as a reference based on the results."
SZCZUKA2022100460,How do children acquire knowledge about voice assistants? A longitudinal field study on children’s knowledge about how voice assistants store and process data,"Voice assistants (VAs) are available in the family context and are easy to interact with. Due to the opaqueness of these assistants, however, children in particular might be unaware of potential negative consequences (e.g., with regard to privacy). To gain a deeper understanding of children’s knowledge about VAs, of how to facilitate knowledge regarding VA technology (focusing here on parental interventions), and of how children’s knowledge and understanding affects their communicative behavior towards VAs (focusing here on telling a secret to the VA), we conducted a longitudinal field study with 16 families (N=20 children). The emphasis was on differentiating between how VAs store and process data, as both aspects are important for a sophisticated usage but vary in how they are experienced or understood. The qualitative data demonstrated that children draw observable inferences from VAs’ behavior, which explains why children know more about how data is processed than about how it is stored or accessed. Our results indicate that parental interventions positively affect children’s understanding of data processing, but that this cannot be transferred to data storage, indicating the need for self-explaining systems. Lastly, knowledge about how data is stored negatively predicts the willingness to entrust a secret to the system, which underlines the importance of a basic understanding of how technologies work, also for younger users."
VANDERSTAP2024100551,Supporting adult-learners’ online interaction in computer-mediated learning,"Previous studies have revealed numerous benefits of computer-mediated learning, yet the design of such learning programmes are not always supportive for adult-learners. Studies show that higher education adult-learners are wary of the digital environment in computer-mediated courses, and hence refrain from online interaction resulting in lower learning outcomes and lower perceived learning satisfaction. Without an instructional model that supports adult-learners’ online interaction, teachers may fall back on traditional in-class teaching in an effort to make up for missed learning opportunities. To remedy this, design principles, specifically supportive for adult-learners, were co-designed into an instructional model reflecting the concentric dynamics that strengthen said programmes. In order to validate and improve the quality of the model a Delphi study was carried out among experts (n = 8) to evaluate the various components of the model, including its overall supportiveness for adult-learners in computer-mediated learning. The experts were selected based on their expertise and research in blended learning. Two evaluative rounds through surveys in the programme Crowdtech took place until full alignment of the experts’ opinions was had. The resulting model is a concentric one, illustrating how activities are best distributed across the online environment and the in-class environment, and how social presence can be evoked. This study provides insights into the design of computer-mediated learning programmes tailored for higher education adult-learners as it closes the gap in literature on instructional models and blended learning design. This validated instructional model may help course designers in designing or improving computer-mediated learning programmes."

PEI2025100406,"Empowering preservice teachers’ AI literacy: Current understanding, influential factors, and strategies for improvement","Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant potential in transforming future educational practices by enhancing teaching and learning. However, its full realization heavily depends on teachers' AI literacy, which significantly influences their engagement levels with AI technologies and their abilities to adopt AI technologies effectively in similar settings. In this study, we conduct a holistic analysis examining pre-service teachers' AI literacy for providing insights about current understanding of AI technologies, perceptions of the applications of AI in education, ethical issues and strategies for effectively enhancing AI literacy. Guided by Bloom's Taxonomy, a comprehensive, layered survey was designed to systematically evaluate pre-service teachers' AI literacy competencies. The Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM3) was mapped onto each layer to design questions that identify factors influencing pre-service teachers' AI literacy proficiency. The survey was administered to a sample of 200 pre-service teachers in a large public university. Descriptive analysis and ANOVA were conducted to examine how the influential factors influence AI literacy within and across layers. We also conducted a thematic analysis to identify the most preferred strategies to enhance pre-service teachers' AI literacy. The analytical results revealed a significant gap in understanding levels of AI mechanisms among pre-service teachers and highlighted its positive associations with their engagement, perceptions and ethical considerations of AI in educational settings. The findings also underscored the importance of hands-on, practical training and in-person collaborative learning for enhancing pre-service teachers' AI literacy. Finally, we discussed practical implications regarding implementing training and professional development programs for fostering pre-service teachers' AI literacy."
PENALOZAAPONTE2024e00609,Automated entrance monitoring to investigate honey bee foraging trips using open-source wireless platform and fiducial tags,"Honey bee foraging is a complex behavior because it involves tens of thousands of organisms making decisions about where to collect pollen and nectar based on the quality of resources and the distance to flowers. Studying this aspect of their biology is possible through direct observations but the large number of individuals involved in this behavior makes the implementation of technologies ideal to scale up this type of study. Consequently, there is a need for instruments that can facilitate accurate assessments of honey bee foraging at the colony level. To address this need, this work aimed to develop an automated imaging system for monitoring the in-and-out activity of honey bee foragers as they walk through a customized entrance with a camera sensor at the hive entrance. We used AprilTags attached to each bee’s thorax to provide unique identification numbers that allowed the system to track in-and-out events throughout the foraging season of the colony. Our design relies on low-cost Raspberry Pi computers and cameras, along with commercially off-the-shelf components, making it easily reproducible with the open-source documentation provided. We successfully deployed and evaluated our system in six locations, demonstrating consistent results. In this paper, we present the details about the development of the system, data collected from multiple colonies, and post-processing analysis from one of our apiaries. Our results highlight the system’s effectiveness in monitoring honey bee trips, capturing various behaviors associate with their activities outside the colony, which lay the groundwork for future estimations of foraging distances."
OKONKWO2023191,Synthesis of nested loop exercises for practice in introductory programming,"Novice programmers struggle to comprehend specific programming constructs such as arrays, recursion, and loops. One way to address this challenge is to provide practice problems for students in these topics that are considered difficult to comprehend — such as nested loops. It is proven that practice aids program comprehension, hence, since it is time consuming to manually create many practice problems; synthesising these problems is an Expert Artificial Intelligence Task that is worth investigating. In this paper we present the synthesis of nested loop exercises in Python for practice using a context-free grammar. We defined the grammar rules for modeling program templates. Algorithms were designed and implemented for the generation of structurally different nested loop exercises based on the defined production rules of the context-free grammar. Each program generated consists of two or more looping statements, with a nesting, and the context-free grammar rules also allow for the spawning of infinitely many sub-loops for every loop. We checked for the correctness of the synthesised nested loop programs with an experimental procedure of iteratively supplying these programs to the Python interpreter. The first 120,000 iterations returned no syntactic bugs, hence, showing that these programs do compile and have outputs. Furthermore, an evaluation of the programs was carried out in a survey with 210 participants (novice and expert programmers). The results of the evaluation show that over 82% of the participants agreed that the synthesised exercises were correctly generated, solvable and can be used as practice exercises for novice programmers in introductory programming modules. 120,000 iterations of synthesised loop programs can be found at: https://tinyurl.com/nestedloops2021."
ZHANG202375,Thinking and Practicing Like a Scientist?,"This study aimed to develop a valid and reliable instrument, the Mental Images of Scientists Questionnaire (MISQ), and use the instrument to examine Chinese students’ mental images of scientists’ characters across school levels, regions, living settings, and gender. The final version of the MISQ consisted of four constructs: scientists’ cognitive, affective, lifestyle, and job characters. The results showed that senior high school students gave higher scores for scientists’ cognitive character construct than junior high and elementary school students did. Students from eastern regions, which have a more highly developed economy, gave the highest scores on cognitive and affective character constructs of scientists. Students from western regions, which have a less developed economy, had a relatively negative impression of scientists. Students’ images of scientists’ affective, lifestyle, and job characters were positively correlated with their interests in pursuing scientific careers. Future research to explore the relationships between students’ mental images of scientists’ characters and students’ motivation to pursue science-related careers or to engage in scientific practices are recommended."
AYDIN2021101536,Does the digital divide matter? Factors and conditions that promote ICT literacy,"Individuals’ computer skills have long been noteworthy for both education and the labor market. Although the support provided through curricula in schools develops these skills to a certain extent, digital divide still exists for individuals with different socio-demographic characteristics. The concept of digital divide, used to define individuals who do not have equal access to digital technologies, has started to be seen as a determining factor for digital competencies with its expanding scope. The current study aims to take a perspective to investigate the effect of socio-demographic variables, which may cause digital divide, on students' ICT literacy. With this study, it is sought to explain the effect of current inequalities regarding digital access on students' ICT skills. To this end, the socio-demographic characteristics of the students in the sample of Korea and Chile from the participating countries of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) were examined in the context of ICT literacy. The characteristics of the models created were compared for both countries. While parents’ level of education variable stands out for the Chilean model, the internet connection variable is remarkable for the Korean model. It is anticipated that the findings of the research will contribute to understanding the dynamics of the digital divide and its possible consequences, and can be a source for preventive policy steps to be developed."
KONG2025100359,Developing and validating a scale of empowerment in using artificial intelligence for problem-solving for senior secondary and university students,"Empowerment enables students to be psychologically and affectively ready to leverage the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI). However, a theory-driven scale to extend empowerment into the use of AI for problem-solving is lacking. This study developed and validated an 11-item scale of empowerment in using AI for problem-solving (EUAIPS) based on a proposed conceptual framework that synthesises empowerment and AI-related literature. The EUAIPS scale encompasses impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness in using AI for problem-solving. We collected data from a diverse sample of Hong Kong senior secondary and university students before (N = 477) and after the course (N = 409). Results demonstrated that the EUAIPS scale with a three-factor structure had good reliability and validity. Students also felt significantly more empowered to use AI for problem-solving after a 14-h course using AI for problem-solving. These findings empirically support the affective dimension of AI literacy and show that psychological control/competence is particularly important for students to harness AI to solve problems at the affective level. This study presents a valid instrument for researchers and practitioners to measure empowerment in using AI for problem-solving and informs AI literacy curriculum designers about including learning activities to help students realise its impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness."
TANKSLEY202436,“We’re changing the system with this one”: Black students using critical race algorithmic literacies to subvert and survive AI-mediated racism in school,"Purpose
This paper aims to center the experiences of three cohorts (n = 40) of Black high school students who participated in a critical race technology course that exposed anti-blackness as the organizing logic and default setting of digital and artificially intelligent technology. This paper centers the voices, experiences and technological innovations of the students, and in doing so, introduces a new type of digital literacy: critical race algorithmic literacy.
Design/methodology/approach
Data for this study include student interviews (called “talk backs”), journal reflections and final technology presentations.
Findings
Broadly, the data suggests that critical race algorithmic literacies prepare Black students to critically read the algorithmic word (e.g. data, code, machine learning models, etc.) so that they can not only resist and survive, but also rebuild and reimagine the algorithmic world.
Originality/value
While critical race media literacy draws upon critical race theory in education – a theorization of race, and a critique of white supremacy and multiculturalism in schools – critical race algorithmic literacy is rooted in critical race technology theory, which is a theorization of blackness as a technology and a critique of algorithmic anti-blackness as the organizing logic of schools and AI systems."
LIN2021100006,Modeling the structural relationship among primary students’ motivation to learn artificial intelligence,"The recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) present both challenges and opportunities for educational practitioners. A new AI curriculum has been developed and piloted in many primary schools in Beijing, China. The present study had two aims: (1) to test the factor structure of students’ motivation to learn AI and (2) to examine possible gender differences in students’ motivation to learn AI. This online questionnaire–based research recruited 420 primary students from the piloting schools. Structural equation modeling was employed to test a hypothesized model comprising six motivational factors and strategies: (1) intrinsic motivation, (2) career motivation, (3) attention, (4) relevance, (5) confidence, and (6) satisfaction. The study discovered intrinsic motivation to have the strongest influence on career motivation, while the motivational strategies of attention, relevance, and confidence also influenced career motivation. Additionally, compared with female students, male students scored higher in terms of motivational factors and strategies. The findings serve as a reference for the future development of AI curricula and instruction."
JOSHI2025100754,Exploring player agency in educational video games,"Player agency is the freedom and control to make decisions during gameplay. Game designers shape player agency by including alternative storylines, optional objectives, and developing a range of mechanics thereby enriching player experience with novelty and variety during gameplay. So far, there is a dearth of studies that focus on giving autonomy to players over the use of learning mechanic in educational games. This study explores the impact of providing players with the autonomy over the use of learning mechanic. Students interacted with two versions of a computer programming game prototype differing in the level of player agency in terms of freedom to employ the learning mechanics during gameplay. We employed quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate if player agency affected students’ learning outcomes, game enjoyment, and intrinsic motivation to learn. The results have implications for design of educational games, suggesting that incorporating player agency, particularly in the context of choosing learning mechanics, can enhance enjoyment and intrinsic motivation without compromising the educational effectiveness of the game."
DAI2024101899,Dual-contrast pedagogy for AI literacy in upper elementary schools,"Background
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the need to equip young students with basic AI-related knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10–12.
Aims
This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment.
Sample
One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72).
Methods
Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance.
Results
The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety.
Conclusions
The DCP approach significantly improved students’ learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy. This study highlights the pedagogical value of human-AI comparisons in teaching AI, while contributing to a research agenda on the cognitive and conceptual aspects of AI education."
WU2025102488,What is the role of learning style preferences on the STEM learning attitudes among high school students?,"STEM education research suggests that teaching methods have varying effects on students, contingent on their learning styles, resulting in disparities in STEM learning attitudes. A STEM learning attitude scale was employed to assess 604 Taiwanese 10th grade students. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on 304 samples, while an additional 307 samples underwent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). This study developed a STEM learning attitude instrument and explored the correlation between students' learning styles and STEM attitudes using the Kolb Learning Style Inventory. The results indicated that students with converger and assimilator learning styles exhibited better STEM learning attitudes. In contrast, students with diverger and accommodator learning styles displayed lower STEM learning attitudes. Consequently, we advocate the inclusion of diverser and accommodator learning styles in the design of STEM curricula and emphasize the cultivation of collaboration and communication skills in real-world contexts."
MARTINEZCOMESANA202393,Impact of artificial intelligence on assessment methods in primary and secondary education: Systematic literature review,"The educational sector can be enriched by the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various aspects. The field of artificial intelligence and its applications in the education sector give rise to a multidisciplinary field that brings together computer science, statistics, psychology and, of course, education. Within this context, this review aimed to synthesise existing research focused on provide improvements on primary/secondary student assessment using some AI tool. Thus, nine original research studies (641 participants), published between 2010 and 2023, met the inclusion criteria defined in this systematic literature review. The main contributions of the application of AI in the assessment of students at these lower educational levels focus on predicting their performance, automating and making evaluations more objective by means of neural networks or natural language processing, the use of educational robots to analyse their learning process, and the detection of specific factors that make classes more attractive. This review shows the possibilities and already existing uses that AI can bring to education, specifically in the evaluation of student performance at the primary and secondary levels.
Resumen
El sector educativo puede enriquecerse con la incorporación de la inteligencia artificial (IA) en diversos aspectos.

Esta revisión muestra las posibilidades y los usos ya existentes que la IA puede aportar a la educación, concretamente en la evaluación del rendimiento del alumnado de primaria y secundaria."
CETIN2021652,Are Maternal Personality Traits an Etiological Factor in Adolescents with Functional Chest Pain?,"Background
In the etiology of functional chest pain (FCP), parental personality traits are worth considering in the context of the biopsychosocial model. The αlpha factor sub-dimension of the five-factor personality model (5FPM) includes agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. There is increasing evidence that this dimension may be related to psychosomatic diseases. It was aimed to investigate how maternal personality traits affect adolescents with FCP. The hypothesis was determined that adolescents diagnosed with FCP can have lower quality of life and be more depressive/anxious and their mothers can have factor-α personality traits and be more depressive/anxious.
Methods
The sample of this single-center, cross-sectional, case-control study consisted of 25 adolescents with FCP and their parents. The control group consisted of 35 age and sex matched healthy adolescents and their parents. Psychopathology was screened using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and psychiatric comorbidities were excluded. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and KINDL forms were completed by the adolescents. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Five-Factor Personality Inventory short form (FFPI) were completed by the parents.
Results
Mothers of adolescents with FCP scored significantly higher compared with mothers of healthy controls in agreeableness and conscientiousness and scored significantly lower in neuroticism. Higher levels of mothers’ neuroticism scores were associated with higher CDI and STAI-1 scores in FCP group. Agreeableness (Exp (B) = 10.097; p = .004; confidence interval [CI] = 2.049-49.745) and conscientiousness (Exp (B) = 16.414; p = .011; CI = 1.902-141.682) were statiscally significant in regression model.
Conclusions
This study showed for the first time that mother's alpha factor personality traits may be one of the factors that contribute to the presence of FCP."
LEPP2025100642,"Does generative AI help in learning programming: Students’ perceptions, reported use and relation to performance","In 2022, the release of ChatGPT marked a significant advancement in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, particularly impacting fields like computer science and education. The ability to generate code snippets using AI chatbots has introduced new opportunities and challenges in teaching programming. However, there is limited agreement on how students integrate them into their learning processes. This study aims to explore how students utilize AI chatbots in the ""Object-Oriented Programming"" course and examine the relationship between chatbot usage and academic performance. To address this, 231 students completed a survey assessing the frequency and manner of chatbot usage. Descriptive statistical methods were employed to analyze usage and perceptions, while Spearman's correlation was used to investigate the connection between chatbot usage and course performance. Results indicated that students primarily relied on AI chatbots for programming tasks. Interestingly, students' performance negatively correlates with the reported frequency of using these tools. These findings provide valuable insights for programming educators, offering a better understanding of students' perceptions and use of AI chatbots. This knowledge can inform strategies for integrating these tools effectively into computer science education."
TADLAOUIBRAHMI2022100348,Digital citizenship in primary education: A systematic literature review describing how it is implemented,"Digital citizenship (DC) has been introduced to the curriculum at Swiss primary schools, a fact that underscores the importance digital skills have for citizens of the future. Already prior to this development, an increasing number of scholarly publications on the concept appeared. In this project, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify how DC has been operationalized in teaching practices to date. The findings reveal that DC is often used as an umbrella term for technology-related learning tasks that nevertheless fail to actively engage students in practicing DC in a critical manner. In addition, older students are often asked to develop DC in project-based learning outside the school setting. While interdisciplinary approaches to DC have been proposed, disciplines such as philosophy or ecology—apparently necessary to work on citizenship—are not considered. Finally, digital tools/environments are never questioned and always imposed; as such, a critical approach to DC is not explicitly developed in the classroom. This literature review discusses the practical implications of the current state of research."
AHMEDALISMAIL2023e19275,Teachers’ perspectives of utilizing distance learning to support 21st century skill attainment for K-3 elementary students during the COVID-19 pandemic era,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Saudi Arabia, similar to other governments, discontinued face-to-face learning in favor of distance learning. The pandemic has had serious ramifications for K-3 education, and the impact of distance learning on 21st century skill attainment are important issues to explore. Using the Saudi Arabia context, this paper investigates teachers’ perspectives regarding the implementation of online education to support 21st century skills in the COVID-19 pandemic era for K-3 elementary school students. A qualitative research methodology was applied in this study. A semi-structured interview was conducted to collect data from five K-3 female teachers who implemented online education during the pandemic. Three themes emerged from the findings: 1) effects of the pandemic as related to online teaching for attainment of 21st century skills, 2) elaboration of best practices for online teaching to facilitate such attainment, and 3) challenges that exist for distance learning and student acquisition of 21st century skills. Therefore, the findings suggest that elementary teachers should find opportunities for elementary students to experience distance learning as an ongoing learning solution in order to incorporate innovative strategies that enhance their 21st century skills."
MARNEWICK2021100026,Digital intelligence: A must-have for project managers,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) requires a fundamental change in the way we live, work and relate to one another. It requires a new type of intelligence to deal with this fundamental change. This new type of intelligence requires new competencies. Yet, it is not crystal clear what these new competencies should be, especially those relating to the discipline of project management. Project leaders are required to implement and manage 4IR-related projects but do not necessarily have the required competencies. This is especially the case in a developing country such as South Africa. The study explored the digital competencies that are deemed important by project managers in managing projects in the digital economy. Q-methodology was used to determine potential perspectives, and three confirming perspectives and one emergent perspective were identified. The main competence deemed important is online communication and collaboration, whereas cybersecurity is deemed unimportant. This study is the first of its kind and provides insight into the digital intelligence of project leaders. It contributes to the current debate around the future digital competencies and skills that are required. It also provides guidelines for organisations on how to plan and structure training and to upskill their current project leaders. A concerted effort needs to be in place to upskill project leaders. It cannot be left to fate."
RADU2023100008,Charting opportunities and guidelines for augmented reality in makerspaces through prototyping and co-design research,"Makerspace environments are becoming popular project-based learning spaces where students interact with physical objects and peer collaboration, while developing 21st century skills and engaging with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) topics. At the same time, augmented reality (AR) technology, which combines physical objects with digital visualizations, is becoming increasingly applicable for makerspace activities and has potential to address challenges for student learning in makerspaces. However, there is a lack of understanding of how to use and integrate AR in real makerspace environments. In this research we use a co-design methodology to address the following questions: (1) How can AR be useful for education in makerspaces? (2) How are students impacted by the process of co-designing AR technology? and (3) What are practical considerations for integrating AR in makerspaces? We engaged in a co-design process in a semester-long makerspace course attended by 18 students in a graduate school of education. Through this process, we generated six prototypes with seven student co-designers, exploring AR use in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. We also identified areas where AR technology can benefit makerspaces, such as teaching STEM skills, facilitating construction activities, enhancing contextualization of learning, and debugging. We observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and AR, and increased critical thinking about AR technology. These results suggest considerations and guidelines for integrating AR technology into makerspace environments."
PALOMINO2023100596,Predicting user types with symbolic images: An empirical validation based on two card-sorting studies,"In gamification, personalization is considered an important field of research since it can improve user engagement and motivation. Particularly, effective gamified learning needs to strike a balance between gameful design that promotes engagement and does not negatively affect content comprehension and absorption. The existing traditional user-type questionnaires approaches are time-consuming and intrusive, hampering the user’s focus. Previous research in gamification demonstrated how to automate player profile creation through log file analysis of gameful systems instead of traditional approaches, however, psychological archetypes and motivational groups can simplify the process of collecting data to achieve a balanced level of personalization for gamified systems, which are grounded on the user’s profile and preferences which can help with their immersion. To attend to the needs of a wide range of fields that introduce gamification to systems that are not classified as games, a new ludic approach was created to define user types based on user interaction using symbolic images. In this exploratory research, we tested this approach in two card-sorting studies (N=35 and N=19). Our results show that the images can be used to predict the users’ archetypes and motivational groups accurately. Thus, we contribute with validating an image-based user type classification method that is easier to deploy in systems that do not aim to behave as a game but are looking to reap the benefits of personalizing a user’s content and gameful experience where relevant. Our second contribution is delivering guidelines to replicate this validation method to other existing approaches. We expect that with this guideline, we facilitate personalization with other user typologies without disrupting the gameful experience."
DEMIR2023101286,Cross-cultural critical thinking profiles: A multigroup latent profile analysis,"Background
Critical thinking (CT) is an important 21st-century skill which enables individuals to actively use their knowledge and problem-solving skills to overcome life challenges. Educators, employers, and policymakers focus on CT skills to foster scientific thinking in education. In many countries, the development of CT skills has become a major component in education. CT skills training is offered to students based on the assumption that every student learns these skills in the same manner (i.e., homogeneity assumption). However, if heterogenous groups exist, accounting for this may provide more effective CT skills training.
Methods
Latent profile analysis (LPA) was applied to the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) with middle school students from South Korea (N = 520), Turkey (N = 996), and the United States (N = 1,599), separately, to determine if CT subpopulations exist for each country. Generalizability of the latent profiles across countries were investigated through a multi-group LPA similarity assessment.
Results
Employing multiple fit criteria, a three-profile solution was identified for each country, and multi-group LPA analysis supported the similarity of the profiles across countries.
Conclusion
Similar CT skill profiles across countries suggest that interventions for developing CT skills may be appropriate across educational contexts. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind a student's CT profile and inform interventions or curricula for fostering CT skills. Future directions and limitations were discussed."
LIU2025108569,Enhancing student GAI literacy in digital multimodal composing through development and validation of a scale,"It is widely acknowledged that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has exerted a greater influence on EFL learners' digital multimodal composing (DMC) process. GAI focuses on creating new textual and multimodal content using large language models (LLMs), and it puts different demands on EFL learners. Although much research has been conducted on EFL learners' AI literacy in various socio-cultural contexts, more attention should now be paid to EFL learners' GAI literacy in the DMC context, a new autonomous model of literacy. It should be noted that even though some studies may concentrate on users' perceptions and experiences with GAI, which may be closely tied to GAI literacy, there lacks the development of a scale for assessing GAI literacy in DMC. Thus, this study attempted to fill these research gaps by developing and validating an applicable and generalizable instrument to measure Chinese EFL learners' multimodal GAI literacy in their DMC process. Two subsamples (n1 = 296, n2 = 294) were randomly invited to respond to the GAIDMCS, and the data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the validity and reliability of the instrument. The findings suggested that a four-factor solution with 17 items can help explain Chinese EFL learners’ GAI literacy in DMC in terms of affective learning, behavior learning, cognitive learning, and ethical learning. Our GAI literacy in DMC scale may help improve GAI education for researchers and practitioners by providing a comprehensive and plausible framework that can serve as an outline for further syllabus design."
WILSON2024100194,A Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach to understanding students’ perceptions of Automated Writing Evaluation,"Automated writing evaluation (AWE) has shown promise in enhancing students’ writing outcomes. However, further research is needed to understand how AWE is perceived by middle school students in the United States, as they have received less attention in this field. This study investigated U.S. middle school students’ perceptions of the MI Write AWE system. Students reported their perceptions of MI Write's usefulness using Likert-scale items and an open-ended survey question. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent topics in students’ comments, followed by qualitative analysis to interpret the themes related to those topics. We then examined whether these themes differed among students who agreed or disagreed that MI Write was a useful learning tool. The LDA analysis revealed four latent topics: (1) students desire more in-depth feedback, (2) students desire an enhanced user experience, (3) students value MI Write as a learning tool but desire greater personalization, and (4) students desire increased fairness in automated scoring. The distribution of these topics varied based on students’ ratings of MI Write's usefulness, with Topic 1 more prevalent among students who generally did not find MI Write useful and Topic 3 more prominent among those who found MI Write useful. Our findings contribute to the enhancement and implementation of AWE systems, guide future AWE technology development, and highlight the efficacy of LDA in uncovering latent topics and patterns within textual data to explore students’ perspectives of AWE."
SHEN2020886,The New Engineering Education in China,"Under the background of accelerating new industrial revolution, China’s higher engineering education is in urgent need of cultivating a group of innovative talents in engineering science and technology. In order to improve the quality of engineering education, China proposed the “new engineering research and practice project” in June 2017. This study attempted to adopt systematic review based on 207 projects of engineering superior universities in China’s new engineering research and practice project for text analysis, and discovered the common key issues such as mechanism issues, ability issues and discipline issues that are concerned in existing projects. The research findings are as follows: (1) The commonness of construction schemes is emerging. In terms of mechanism construction, the mechanism of collaborative education receives the most attention, while the talent ability pays more attention to the cultivation of soft ability; (2) The overall design of the projects are somewhat lacking innovation and features, and certain construction schemes are similar, failing to effectively combine the advantages of universities and disciplines to serve local industries and truly show its characteristics; (3) Most of the construction plans are aimed at the transformation of traditional disciplines, and there is little construction of corresponding disciplines for certain national key industries."
YANG2025101754,Making a Makerspace in early childhood education: Effects on children's STEM thinking skills and emotional development,"Makerspaces are used to promote classroom change and creativity for the 21st century. Building on the learning theory of Constructionism, this intervention study used a curriculum intervention program, “Making a Makerspace” (MM), to integrate the makerspace into Chinese kindergartens. We used a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the effects of this curriculum intervention, with 120 children enrolled in the experimental classrooms, while the other 111 children enrolled in the waitlist control classrooms. Teacher-report child performance (N = 231) showed that the MM program resulted in significantly higher scores in children's STEM habits of mind in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Analyses of parent-report child behaviors revealed that there was a significant effect of the MM program on post-intervention temperamental surgency. Our evidence shows that such a scalable program encourages and guides teachers to build a positive learning environment for supporting young children's making and thinking in everyday preschool experiences. The makerspace further sets a solid foundation for the development of children's STEM thinking skills and socioemotional skills in a rapidly changing digital society."
MALIK2023122913,Exploring the impact of fairness of social bots on user experience,"There exists literary evidence that there is an established relationship between humanizing bots and customer perceptions of fairness and consequential user experience. This study seeks to evaluate factors that impact the perception surrounding the fairness of social bots and the impact of these factors on user experience. A qualitative approach was used to examine the fairness factors related to social bots and their impact on user experience with the help of data collected from 32 professionals with diverse backgrounds. The results obtained from manual coding and NVivo were assessed to evaluate the convergence of themes for the confluence of results and establish thematic validity. The findings revealed two major themes namely, artificial intelligence (AI) technology governance and AI technology outcome. This research furthers user experience literature and provides a theoretical framework delineating antecedents (AI technology governance and AI technology outcomes) of positive user experience while deploying AI-based social bots."
FOUOTSAMANFOUO2022e11637,Investigating the effects of drought and lockdowns on smallholder and commercial agricultural production in KwaZulu-Natal using remotely sensed data,"Not many efforts have been made so far to understand the effects of both the 2015–2016 drought and the 2020 lockdown measures on the agricultural production of smallholder vis-a-vis commercial farmers in Kwazulu-Natal. Google Earth Engine, and random forest algorithm, are used to generate a dataset that help to investigate this question. A regression is performed on double differenced data to investigate the effects of interest. A k-mean cluster analysis, is also used to determine whether the distribution patterns of crop production changed with drought and disruption of agricultural production input. Results show that: (1) droughts affected the agricultural production of both areas similarly. Crop cover declined in both areas for one season after droughts were broken. Then recovery was driven by greener, more productive crops rather than the expansion of crop area. (2) The response of both areas to the COVID-19 lockdown was also similar. Both smallholder and commercial areas' Normalised Difference Vegetation Index – a proxy for crop vitality – improved in response to regulations favourable to the sector and improved rainfall. No significant adjustments in crop cover were observed. Production therefore changed primarily at the intensive margin (improved productivity of existing croplands) rather than the extensive (changing the extent of land under cultivation). (3) Cluster analysis allows for a more granular view, showing that the positive impact of lockdowns on agriculture were concentrated in areas with high rainfall and close proximity to metropolitan markets. Both smallholder and commercial farmers therefore are reliant on market access together with favourable environmental conditions for improved production."
PERISIC2023e16836,"The foundation for future education, teaching, training, learning, and performing infrastructure - The open interoperability conceptual framework approach","The proliferation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Education, Teaching, Training, Learning, and the operational application (Performing) of acquired knowledge, skills, and competencies in contemporary social environments has directly influenced the transformation of early Networked Learning (NL) concepts into a Global Learning Infrastructure. Creating cooperative/collaborative stakeholders networks composed of learning subjects, objects, and competencies consumers, exposes the significant potential for gaining overall social progress. The main challenging obstacles of such globalization are: embedding semantics into the competence credentials carriers, trusted dissemination of verifiable competence tokens, the heterogeneous ontologies mapping, and sustainable service delivery infrastructure. The mainstream motivation of our research is the specification and development of a conceptual framework that fosters the interoperability of different stakeholders, whether individual or institutional, to declare, share and maintain the representative collections of information resources related to the particular Education, Learning, Teaching, Training, and Performing (Research, Development, Production, and Service) endeavors. In this article, we have specified an open, heterogeneous, interoperable conceptual framework capable of orchestrating past, current, and future paradigms to foster building the foundations for comparative analysis and evaluation of traditional and nontraditional competency-building processes, joined with students' portfolio creation, dissemination, and management. It is a starting specification that would serve for the future: open, heterogeneous, cooperative/collaborative, service-oriented software framework specification and development."
SHANSHAN2022104630,Metaphor and board writing matter: The mediating roles of psychological distance and immersion in video lectures,"The present study investigated the inﬂuence of metaphor and board writing on students’ learning performance, continuance intention, and recommendation intention through the mediating effects of psychological distance and immersion. Four aspects of psychological distance—temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical distance—and immersion are introduced to identify the mechanism. Through a two (with versus without metaphor) by two (with versus without board writing) between-subject experimental design, 193 participants were randomly assigned to one of four sets of video lectures on the gradient descent method, followed by an online questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the research model. The results demonstrate that metaphor has a significant effect on all four aspects of psychological distance and immersion, while board writing has an impact only on hypothetical distance. Social distance mediates the relationship between metaphor and learning performance, recommendation intention, and continuance intention; hypothetical distance mediates the interplay between metaphor, board writing, and learning performance; and immersion mediates the link between metaphor and recommendation intention."
TSOUTSA2024180,Empowering urban futures: Key competencies for smart city resilience officers,"As cities are developing to smart, new systems are utilized that contain a multitude of critical infrastructures. Although these offer major advantages, they are also exposed to new external and frequently uncontrollable factors increasing their risk exposure and enhancing their vulnerability. Therefore, increasing resilience during city development has become a prerequisite for its survival, but continuous resilience improvement led by workforce will help them to prosper. According to researchers, officers should be able to catalogue and prioritize threats and vulnerabilities, but is this only the case? Discrete studies detail and analyze in-depth risks related to smart cities, however, how these risks are addressed by workforce and how these are related to their competencies have not been thoroughly understood to date. If vulnerabilities are not understood and analyzed appropriately by the city workforce and stakeholders, unanticipated consequences and cascading failures may potential occur, even when crises are expected. The objective of this article is to inquire into responsibilities regarding crisis issues concerning the necessary competencies for resilience officers, by exploring current perceptions, expectations and recommendations as these are acknowledged in experts’ opinions and experiences. To do so, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to experts in the field, across various cities in Greece, to indicate responsibilities, and prioritize competencies that resilient officers in smart cities should possess. The findings highlighted significant responsibilities related to managing smart city risks and identified a distinct set of competencies unique to officers in this area, emphasizing the need for targeted efforts to enhance urban resilience through the initiatives led by city officers. This article establishes a clear path for advancing smart city research by highlighting competencies that could be integrated into educational curriculums. These competencies are essential for training a workforce that not only enhances disaster management awareness but also equips cities to handle potential catastrophic events effectively, thereby laying the groundwork for more resilient urban environments."
AURAVA2023100129,"Future-oriented skills and knowledge in game jams, a systematic literature review","Game jams, events for co-creating digital or non-digital games, are connected to learning in several ways: learning is a common motivation for participation and various learning results have been reported as their outcome. The existing literature on game jam learning consists mostly of descriptive individual case studies, with very incohesive and varied research aims, methods, and settings. Thus far, there have been no attempts to further analyze and classify the reported results of the previous studies. This article looks at existing research on game jams and learning, comparing the reported learning results to the future-oriented skills and knowledge. The data set, created utilizing the PRISMA checklist, consists of 25 original articles published between 2010 and 2022. The results show that participation in a game jam event will likely increase interdisciplinary, epistemic, and procedural knowledge. Furthermore, it can increase disciplinary knowledge depending on the theme and other framings of the event. Participation in a game jam event will likely further cognitive and metacognitive skills as well as social and emotional skills, provided the jam event is organized to create a safe and inclusive space for learning. Participation in a game jam will also likely further diverse practical and physical skills, but the adoption of these skills varies depending on individuals’ tasks inside their team. ICT-related skills are furthered in jam events concentrating on digital games and can be supported when making non-digital games. Thus, game jams offer a well-suited method for learning future-oriented skills and knowledge."
JACOB2022470,Algorithmic Approaches to Classify Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Research Perspective,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability that exhibits sluggish progress in vocal development, restricted interest in normal activity and repetitive disoriented behavior. This syndrome, has gained a lot of attention due to its prevalence among children across all countries and from different economic backgrounds. However, ASD detection and treatment yet remains in its infancy due to the lack of awareness among parents, limited screening of proper developmental milestones and a dearth of diagnostic tools to classify this syndrome with convincing accuracy. Recent studies report that scalable biomarkers for early detection have made little progress in research due to the erraticism of this disorder. Moreover, the study on developing tools or applications for parents, teachers, and healthcare workers to identify children who exhibit any form of autism is still a work in progress. The research work undertaken in this paper presents an analysis of supervised machine learning algorithms on mining interesting details that link the diverse nature of ASD and the possibility of computationally detecting markers for the syndrome. The preliminary findings on the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms in ASD classification is reported with the possibility of integrating deep learning architectures for ASD detection and therapy."
SCREPANTI2022267,Control Engineering and Robotics since Primary School: an Infrastructure for creating the Digital Twin model of the Learning Class.,"Control engineering has a cross-boundary nature because its applications span over a wide range of fields, among which science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Creating an automation literacy from the Primary School's age is beneficial for pupils because it supports the development of valuable skills that allow the comprehension and analysis of real-world phenomena. Even if many researchers and policymakers have advocated for engineering education since early education, it is usually kept for undergraduate and graduate-level education. What prevents systems theory and control education from being integrated into K12 education is the lack of available educational resources and the lack of indicators to represent the learning gain of students. To help teachers in the latter aspect, a solution can be studying the entire process as a cyber-physical human system (CPHS). The paper consists of a brief report about the work carried out by authors to represent the entire classroom as a CPHS where the physical robots designed by students, humans (teachers and learners), and cybertechnologies are interconnected to accomplish a goal which is learning. The entire infrastructure could be seamlessly deployed into the classroom, supporting learning assessment and the feedback process starting from the deployment of a (quasi) real-time intelligent collection system."
UNTERNAHRER20241115,Enhancing Knowledge Transmission: The Perspective of Gamification User Profiles,"In the realm of knowledge transmission, organizations face the challenge of finding effective strategies to engage individuals and facilitate knowledge transfer. Traditional methods often fall short, failing to capture individuals’ attention and ignite their motivation to actively participate in the knowledge transmission process. This article introduces Colearnis, a novel knowledge transmission platform, which allows peers to transfer knowledge in a gamified manner by using videos and quizzes which are directly created by the employees. This article also presents a long-term field study investigating the use of Colearnis with 130 employees in a worldwide metallurgy and tooling company. A multi-dimensional evaluation approach makes use of user surveys and behavior-tracking data to explore prospective avenues which might benefit knowledge transmission. Users have been profiled under demographical and managerial aspects, however also under their gamification user types according to the Hexad framework for gamification design. This study explores the connections between user profiles and engagement behaviors within Colearnis. The findings suggest that factors such as; age influence the achiever and philanthropist user types, however also that individuals with greater managerial duties are more likely to be classified as socializer, free-spirit, or philanthropist user types. Additionally, this study suggests that socializer or disruptor user types are more likely to consume or react to peers’ self-created knowledge. On the other hand, achiever user profiles are less likely to react or start quizzes. These findings equip organizations with valuable insights to further design and implement engaging ad-hoc knowledge transmission systems. These systems could be further tailored to align with individuals’ managerial profiles and gamification user types, optimizing engagement and increasing the likelihood of successful knowledge transmission."
LIU2025105263,Eye tracking technology for examining cognitive processes in education: A systematic review,"Eye-tracking studies have been increasingly used to investigate student cognitive processes. While some existing literature has reviewed commonly used eye-tracking measures and analytical methods across different contexts, there remains a gap in clarifying the educational themes, cognitive theories, and specific cognitive processes most frequently examined in recent eye-tracking studies. To address this, this review synthesizes recent educational eye-tracking research analyzing student cognitive processes from January 2012 to November 2024. In total, 313 articles were reviewed, and several main findings emerged: (1) The majority of eye-tracking studies examined the themes of multimedia learning, reading performance, and problem-solving, while fewer focused on second language learning, computer-based tests, and individual differences. (2) About half of the studies were conducted under one or more theories, with Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), and Dual-coding Theory (DCT) being the most frequently applied. (3) Eye-tracking data were primarily collected from college students, and temporal and count measures were typically used to investigate the cognitive process of information organization rather than those of information selection and integration. (4) Basic statistical methods and linear mixed models were widely used to analyze student attention differences. The results of this review provide theoretical and practical insights into the strengths and challenges of using eye-tracking technology to assess the impact of pedagogical interventions in computer-based learning environments."

MULDER2022642,Building cognition through material engagement,"With the ascent of robotic architecture in academic discourse, we ought to reconsider how we understand building cognition. This paper revisits the Rietveld Schröder House from 1924 as a precursor of robotic building. With a built-in capacity for change, the building (now a museum and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site) has a highly adaptable space plan that could be continually reconfigured by its occupants. The agency of change is shared between the house and its occupants, most notably Truus Schröder, who lived in the house for 60 years. This paper takes a material engagement approach to explore the relation between the occupant and the house and speculates how this might be a model for designers of contemporary and future robotic architecture to rethink concepts of autonomy and agency in building cognition."
WANG2024103424,Language learning development in human-AI interaction: A thematic review of the research landscape,"Interaction is an indispensable part of language learning. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied in language learning to promote interaction in the learning process. In response to the paradigmatic shifts in AI application design, this review maps the research landscape of language learning development in human-AI interaction. From the resulting analysis of 49 studies, this study investigates the contextual characteristics by AI-supported interaction type, AI application, target language, educational level, etc. Moreover, three research paradigms are identified in this emerging field, i.e., Paradigm One (AI-directed, teacher-as-facilitator, learner-as-recipient), Paradigm Two (AI/teacher-codirected, learner-as-collaborator), and Paradigm Three (AI/teacher/learner-codirected). The paradigms are induced through analysis of eight constructs: human-AI relationship, learning objective, task type, level of pre-structuring, mode of engagement behavior, knowledge-change process, cognitive outcome, and research focus. The philosophical and linguistic underpinnings for each paradigm are discussed. Additionally, we highlight future research implications including investigating under-researched themes and exploring diverse methodological possibilities and appropriateness among the three research paradigms."
VALERI2025100360,Exploring students’ experience of ChatGPT in STEM education,"The rapid advances in AI technologies showed a disruptive potential in educational practices, presenting new challenges and generating new opportunities. This phenomenon has been exacerbated since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, which has permanently transformed various educational activities and sparked widespread scientific interest. Research suggests that ChatGPT can help students navigate the complexities of STEM subjects. However, only a few studies have directed attention to the use of ChatGPT in STEM subjects in upper secondary education. With the purpose of addressing this gap, the aim of this study is to explore how students experience ChatGPT for their STEM studies, encompassing their usage, perceptions, and general knowledge about this technology. Using a mixed methods approach, the data collected included a survey and semi-structured interviews involving upper secondary students. The results show widespread adoption of ChatGPT across STEM subjects among participants, particularly in biology and especially as a tool to support the understanding of concepts. Although students exhibited limited knowledge of AI, they demonstrated some effective prompting strategies to generate relevant content and tackle potential inaccuracies and hallucinations. The findings in this paper provide insights to support the exploration of students’ experiences of ChatGPT, presenting relevant topics to further research the applications of these AI technologies within STEM subjects, given their importance for future societal development."
WILSON2023146,Principled assessment design,"The aim of this article is to define and exemplify the concept of Principled Assessment Design (PAD) as it is used in the domain of educational testing. The crucial aspect of PAD approaches is that they are centered on models of the cognitive psychology involved in students responding to the assessment and articulate how to use that as the basis for development of the assessments. The account gives an extended description of one PAD approach and summarizes four others, noting common characteristics among them. It concludes with a discussion of how PAD approaches can be extended into the domain of instruction, and a consideration of why PAD is not so commonly recognized by educational professionals."
GOPALI2024100120,The performance of the LSTM-based code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in forecasting time series data,"Generative AI, and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), have gained substantial momentum due to their wide applications in various disciplines. While the use of these game changing technologies in generating textual information has already been demonstrated in several application domains, their abilities in generating complex models and executable codes need to be explored. As an intriguing case is the goodness of the machine and deep learning models generated by these LLMs in conducting automated scientific data analysis, where a data analyst may not have enough expertise in manually coding and optimizing complex deep learning models and codes and thus may opt to leverage LLMs to generate the required models. This paper investigates and compares the performance of the mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, PaLM, LLama, and Falcon, in generating deep learning models for analyzing time series data, an important and popular data type with its prevalent applications in many application domains including financial and stock market. This research conducts a set of controlled experiments where the prompts for generating deep learning-based models are controlled with respect to sensitivity levels of four criteria including (1) Clarify and Specificity, (2) Objective and Intent, (3) Contextual Information, and (4) Format and Style. While the results are relatively mix, we observe some distinct patterns. We notice that using LLMs, we are able to generate deep learning-based models with executable codes for each dataset separately whose performance are comparable with the manually crafted and optimized LSTM models for predicting the whole time series dataset. We also noticed that ChatGPT outperforms the other LLMs in generating more accurate models. Furthermore, we observed that the goodness of the generated models vary with respect to the “temperature” parameter used in configuring LLMS. The results can be beneficial for data analysts and practitioners who would like to leverage generative AIs to produce good prediction models with acceptable goodness."
ZHONG2025105186,Shaping safety: Effective signage for tourist attractions,"This study explores the matching effect between safety sign shapes (circular vs. angular) and safety persuasive appeals (warm vs. competent) on tourists' safety behavior. Three scenario-based and two field-based experiments were conducted to collect data on tourists' responses to different combinations of sign shapes and appeals. Findings indicate that matching circular signs with warm appeals and angular signs with competent appeals enhances tourists' risk aversion and safety behavior. The results contribute to the extension of the social information processing theory in explaining the matching effect of visual and textual cues on safety behavior, adding to the literature on safety signage design. Managerial implications suggest that destination managers can improve tourists’ safety behavior by aligning safety sign shapes with appropriate persuasive appeals, thereby enhancing destination safety."
CONRAD2024100053,Learning effectiveness of immersive virtual reality in education and training: A systematic review of findings,"The use of immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers a variety of design possibilities for action-oriented teaching and learning that enables the promotion of specific knowledge and skills. In order to use IVR applications as an effective teaching and learning medium, it is important to understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of this technology compared to other media. This raises the question of what type of learning environment is most effective in promoting specific knowledge and skills. To answer these questions, a systematic review of research on learning with IVR in an educational context was conducted using the PRISMA method (Liberati et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021). The study analyzed 30 relevant research articles to compare the relative effectiveness of IVR-based learning and its impact on learner engagement, as outlined in the ICAP framework (Chi & Wylie, 2014). The results indicate that IVR has a positive impact on learning compared to other types of media. The study suggests that IVR technology is suitable for learning environments that prioritize active learner engagement and practical application, such as active manipulation and constructive creation. In summary, the results offer more insights into the advantages of using IVR to accomplish particular learning objectives."
ISMAILOVA2021341,Cognitive System to Clarify the Semantic Vulnerability and Destructive Substitutions,"The development of special mathematics capable of directly taking into account the dynamics of the problem domain, as it turns out, is a non-trivial task. Its very formulation in a refined form and the fixation of the most important features cause noticeable complications in the target formalism, significantly complicating the development of software. A constructive solution to this problem is given, obtained using the original functor-as-object construction. The concept of semantic viralization is introduced. It is expected that the obtained computational model has a high innovative potential for the development of information systems designed for intensive data exchange."
SERBAN20202812,QLearn: Towards a framework for smart learning environments,"The new theory of education suggests that learner should be in the center of the learning process and the instructor playing an advising and facilitating role. Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research. The rapid and continuous development of technology that has brought new learning skills for students forces the educational system to enter into a new era. This change is further justified by some unprecedented events that force students to learn remotely. QLearn is an e-learning platform developed as a web based application which provides quizzes for students enrolled at Advanced Programming Methods course from Babeş Bolyai University (Romania) as part of their formative and summative assessment. The existing set of quizzes has been proposed by students throughout the last three iterations of the course in a collaborative manner with course instructor, and this data set is expanding continuously with every new generation of students. QLearn is a smart learning environment offering the students valuable feedback and a good preparation for the exam. Some metrics that quantify the coverage rate of the course syllabus attained by students or their understanding level of knowledge are provided by QLearn. The Artificial Intelligent component of QLearn application uses these measures to make predictions for students’ outcomes at the exam, to find out which topics need to be practised more and to recommend learning plans according to students’ individual needs. The contribution of the paper is therefore twofold. Firstly, we propose a new learning design, based on students’ involvement in a collaborative manner. The second contribution of the paper is QLearn, a software application that provides support (implementation) for the proposed learning process design. Not only does QLearn platform provide a smart learning environment for students, but it also ensures the knowledge transfer from instructors to students in an efficient and effective way."
MORRISON2024100209,Promising practices for online professional learning,"This study took place at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when most schools worldwide were making the transition to online teaching and learning. Through this single-case study design, the study examined the learning experiences of a group of teachers engaged in interactive, inquiry-based professional learning focused on math, making and coding during a shift to emergency remote teaching. The primary objective was to identify promising practices for online professional learning (PL) focused on math and coding using a maker-pedagogies approach to teaching and learning, based on the teachers’ learning experiences. Study participants included 20 teachers from a rural school board in Northern Ontario, Canada. Findings indicated that the following may be considered as promising practices when developing and implementing virtual math and coding PL from a maker perspective. It is important to: a) balance sessions focused on specific math and coding content with more general sessions focused on learning the various maker-technology tools; b) include both synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities for the variety of teachers involved in the learning; c) include collaborative learning in the teacher PL and a virtual platform that can support this type of social learning; d) ensure the PL sessions are on-going as opposed to one-off or isolated sessions. This research suggests that online professional learning sessions need to consider three elements: the teacher, the content, and the learning environment and offers important recommendations for future work in this area."
YOON2022101989,Gender and digital competence: Analysis of pre-service teachers’ educational needs and its implications,"The purpose of this study was to analyze educational needs of pre-service teachers’ digital competence by gender. 157 pre-service teachers at a university in South Korea responded to the on-line survey. For data analyses, the researcher used the paired-samples t-test, Borich needs assessment analysis, and the locus for focus model. Results revealed that male and female pre-service teachers prioritized sub-competences differently. Male pre-service teachers recognized five sub-competences in four areas of digital competence. Female pre-service teachers identified seven sub-competences in five areas as a priority. Three sub-competences such as reflective practice, guidance, and assessment strategies were included in educational needs for both males and females. The researcher discusses implications for improvement of digital competence and pre-service teacher education."
TOMCZYK2024102449,Digital competence among pre-service teachers: A global perspective on curriculum change as viewed by experts from 33 countries,"In the intensely developing information society, the education of pre-service teachers presents an organisational, methodological, and conceptual challenge. Recent years have necessitated reflection on the content and modalities of the formation of digital competence in pre-service teachers. This article – considers which components the digital competences of the new generations of teachers should contain and how this area can be effectively developed within academic education. The article is the result of interviews conducted with 35 experts (recognized scholars in the field of media pedagogy) from North and South America, Africa, Australia and Oceania, Asia, and Europe. Qualitative interviews using the Delphi methodology were conducted between June and September 2022. Using grounded theory principles, it was noted that there is a need to modify pre-service teachers' curricula in the following areas: creating, retrieving and managing digital content; integrating ICT into subject content; developing soft skills; enhancing interactivity in the classroom; social aspects of ICT; distance learning; new socio-technical processes; advanced digital competencies; predictive learning; analysing the impact of ICT on human life; data protection; e-risks; low digital competencies; understanding media messaging; and supporting people with disabilities."
PULEO2022104793,Making Waves in the Classroom – Engaging students in STEM through hands-on coastal oceanography and engineering,"A high school Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) program was initiated to engage students in coastal processes and engineering concepts. Fourteen portable wave flumes were designed, fabricated, and delivered to high schools along the East Coast of the United States from New Jersey to Florida. The ∼5 m long flume consists of a motor-controlled wave paddle at one end and a sediment-surrogate beach at the other end for hands-on activities for coastal dynamics. Sensors for measuring water level and fluid velocity and education modules ranging from basic wave concepts to applications such as beach nourishment are provided to teachers to assist in education delivery. Pre- and post-module worksheets and overall program surveys are used as assessment instruments to gauge effectiveness of the program. The student and teacher assessment results indicate that the portable wave flumes and associated modules were successful in helping students understand coastal processes in an engaging and hands-on manner. All teachers surveyed indicated that they plan to use the flume again. Modifications in the future may include creating lesson plans with more open-ended questions to encourage student exploration, decreasing the apparatus footprint, and using an actuator-controlled wave paddle for irregular wave forcing."
FENG2023e16237,Effects of gender diversity on college students’ collaborative learning: From individual gender to gender pairing,"This study investigated the effects of gender and gender pairing on behaviors and social interaction during collaborative learning in a blended learning environment. Three types of pairing (all-female, all-male, and mixed) were considered in an empirical study with 44 undergraduate students. The results revealed that, first, female students were more likely to perform well in listening, talking, and integrating during class, and in the quality of posts after class, whereas male students tended to engage more in irrelevant behavior in collaboration. Second, same-gender groups were more active in collaborative discussion, but all-male groups performed worst in quality of posts after class. Third, both male and female students were more active in same-gender groups than in mixed groups. Finally, same-gender groups tended to have greater interpersonal connectedness than mixed-gender groups. The paper ends with a list of practical implications for facilitating effective collaborative learning in co-educational college classrooms."

DERIBA2025100251,"Artificial intelligence in Ethiopian school curriculum: Educators' practices, challenges, and recommendations","In light of the ongoing discourse on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into formal education systems, it is imperative to examine both curriculum and teaching practices, particularly in developing regions. This study explores the Information Communication and Technology (ICT) curriculum of Ethiopian secondary schools to identify AI-related content within the learning guide. Additionally, it assesses ICT educators' knowledge, practices, challenges, and recommendations for effectively implementing AI in Ethiopian schools. Employing a qualitative approach, this study reviewed AI content in the Ethiopian secondary school ICT curriculum and conducted audio-recorded interviews with 10 ICT teachers. Document analysis and thematic analysis were utilized to interpret the collected data. The AI content in the curriculum was analyzed and findings were discussed within the framework of the Five Big Ideas in AI. Our findings reveal that the AI content in the Ethiopian secondary school ICT curriculum is predominantly definitional. The thematic analysis of teacher interview data highlights the methods employed in teaching AI, including pedagogical challenges such as limited understanding of AI concepts. Furthermore, several recommendations emerged for the effective implementation of AI in schools, including curriculum revisions to incorporate AI topics in early childhood and primary education, as well as professional development opportunities. We also discuss the implications, limitations, and future research directions of this study."
WENG2022101046,Promoting student creativity and entrepreneurship through real-world problem-based maker education,"Creativity and entrepreneurship are two interconnected competencies, as entrepreneurship promotes and results from creative practice. Making activities that involve real-world problems can help students develop these competencies. Although the engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate (5E) learning cycle for scientific activities has been viewed as an effective instructional strategy for promoting students’ learning engagement and academic gain, few researchers have applied this framework to examine the process of students’ creativity and entrepreneurship development. In this case study, we explored how a maker program integrated with real-world problems fostered four dimensions of students’ creativity and three areas of students’ entrepreneurship from the perspective of the 5E learning cycle. Seventy Grade 9 students (15–16 years old) from a K–12 school in Hong Kong participated in the 5-month maker program. Curriculum documents, activity video recordings, interviews, and student digital media products were collected to facilitate data triangulation. The qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. The study found that the students’ creativity and entrepreneurship were scaffolded in a variety of ways throughout the learning cycle. We describe the innovative efforts made by researchers and suggest an instructional approach for teachers and instructional designers to assess student creativity and entrepreneurship during the five stages of the real-world problem-based maker program."
CUI2021412,Artificial intelligence and computational pathology,"Data processing and learning has become a spearhead for the advancement of medicine, with pathology and laboratory medicine has no exception. The incorporation of scientific research through clinical informatics, including genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, into clinical practice unlocks innovative approaches for patient care. Computational pathology is burgeoning subspecialty in pathology that promises a better-integrated solution to whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics. However, computational pathology faces several challenges, including the ability to integrate raw data from different sources, limitation of hardware processing capacity, and a lack of specific training programs, as well as issues on ethics and larger societal acceptable practices that are still solidifying. The establishment of the entire industry of computational pathology requires far-reaching changes of the three essential elements connecting patients and doctors: the local laboratory, the scan center, and the central cloud hub/portal for data processing and retrieval. Computational pathology, unlocked through information integration and advanced digital communication networks, has the potential to improve clinical workflow efficiency, diagnostic quality, and ultimately create personalized diagnosis and treatment plans for patients. This review describes clinical perspectives and discusses the statistical methods, clinical applications, potential obstacles, and future directions of computational pathology."
DONNELLYHERMOSILLO2020103748,Impact of graph technologies in K-12 science and mathematics education,"Graph technologies are now widely available in K-12 science and mathematics classrooms. These technologies have the potential to impact the learning of science and mathematics, especially by supporting student investigations. We use meta-analysis to analyze 42 design and comparison studies involving data from 7699 students spanning over 35 years. In these studies, graphing technologies include computer software such as simulations; online tools such as graph utilities; and sensors such as temperature probes. We characterize the assessments used to measure graphing. We describe the investigative activities that graphing supports including generating hypotheses or predictions, collecting data, analyzing or interpreting data, and reflecting. Studies show that graphing technologies impact learning of mathematics and science topics as well as graphing itself. These technologies are especially advantageous for learning complex topics where students need to conduct investigations to interpret change over time or position such as functions, kinematics, and thermodynamics. Recent studies take advantage of logs of student interactions to study the design of automated guidance for graphing. We discuss the implications of these findings for instruction at the K-12 level."
BUSTAMANTEBARRETO20232,Changes in Colombian and Korean Teachers’ Self-Efficacy from talis 2018 and its Current Relation with Teacher Digital Competencies,"This study explores the relationship between Teacher Digital Competencies (tdc) and Teacher Self-Efficacy (tse), which affects student outcomes and academic success. With the increasing use of technology in education, the covid19 pandemic highlighted the need for effective use of technology in classrooms. This research examines if tse and other factors such as sociodemographic and school characteristics explain tdc for Korean and Colombian teachers. The study also compares tse levels before and after the pandemic. Results show that tse, sociodemographic factors, and school characteristics explain Colombian tdc, whereas only tse explains Korean tdc. Colombian teachers had higher tse than Korean teachers before and after the pandemic. While tse levels decreased for both countries, there was a surprising increase in the means for tse related to ict. This study highlights the need for further research on tse and tdc in different societies."

The first subsection identifies the main professional groups involved in data-related activities in academic libraries and beyond. In the second subsection, educational issues are targeted with regard to the education of information professionals for research data management, as well as for data literacy. The third subsection examines similarities and convergences between the pedagogy of educating for literacies. Pedagogical approaches, including social-constructionist, cognitive, and connectivist approaches, as well as the Scholarship of Teaching, are characterized here briefly. Inquiry-based learning and the ideas for breaking out of silos are also portrayed, and the tasks of visualization are described as well."
OLARI2024100196,Data-related concepts for artificial intelligence education in K-12,"Due to advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer science education has rapidly started to include topics related to AI along K-12 education. Although this development is timely and important, it is also concerning because the elaboration of the AI field for K-12 is still ongoing. Current efforts may significantly underestimate the role of data, the fundamental component of an AI system. If the goal is to enable students to understand how AI systems work, knowledge of key concepts related to data processing is a prerequisite, as data collection, preparation, and engineering are closely linked to the functionality of AI systems. To advance the field, the following research provides a comprehensive collection of key data-related concepts relevant to K-12 computer science education. These concepts were identified through a theoretical review of the AI field, aligned through a review of AI curricula for school education, evaluated through interviews with domain experts and teachers, and structured hierarchically according to the data lifecycle. Computer science educators can use the elaborated structure as a conceptual guide for designing learning arrangements that aim to enable students to understand how AI systems are created and function."
RUBACH2024190,High school,"High school is a part of secondary schooling and is often the final stage of compulsory schooling. High school plays a crucial role in providing students with mandatory competencies and an educational degree that provides them access to postsecondary education. In this article, we discuss four broad topics related to high school: international perspectives on the structure of high school; adolescents' development in high school related to their needs and experiences; inequality based on gender, ethnicity, and race; and the importance of teachers. We frame the article using stage-environment fit theory and situated expectancy–value theory."
VARAS2023101289,Teachers’ strategies and challenges in teaching 21st century skills: Little common understanding,"Faced with a world of accelerating change and rapidly-evolving technology, education systems must provide students with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. However, many countries have failed to incorporate the teaching of these skills within their schools. Our study therefore looks to portray teachers' understanding, strategies and obstacles in teaching these skills across Latin American classrooms. To do so, we analyzed the responses to an online survey from 1391 active teachers across 20 countries in the region. This revealed varying understandings of 21st century skills, with little common understanding. Most teachers failed to mention the skills included in the most popular framework (the 4 Cs); those who did reported using the same strategies, regardless of the skill being taught. These strategies included project-based learning, oracy activities, literacy strategies, and teamwork. We conclude that there is little or no common understanding around these skills, nor the best strategies for developing them. Our study helps understand the potential causes preventing the teaching of these skills in the classroom, a problem that extends beyond Latin America."
BOBROWICZ2024102399,Prospects in the field of learning and individual differences: Examining the past to forecast the future using bibliometrics,"Over two centuries, research has delved into individual differences in learning across educational and professional contexts. This commentary conducts a bibliometric analysis of 6556 articles, identifying key research keywords, topics and themes, and their historical evolution. The findings revealed a longstanding emphasis on educational psychology, particularly motivation and achievement, rather than cross-curricular competencies and learner's well-being and socio-economic background. Notably, self-regulated learning (SRL) emerged as an overarching research subject in terms of motivation and achievement, but, surprisingly, not (meta)cognition. Prospects for the field build on cross-disciplinary research, theoretical refinement, and methodological advances. Further, the field is expected to maintain academic rigor, address diversity among learners, foster global collaboration, and focus on underprivileged populations."
AURAVA2025104978,Game jams in schools: Teacher views,"This article examines teachers' views of using game jams, co-creative game design events, in schools. Game jamming shows potential to promote several salient learning goals, yet there remains a lack of empirical studies of game jams’ effectiveness and implementation in formal education. Reflexive thematic analysis of nine interviews of teachers in Finland constructed three themes concerning 1) pedagogical theories and teacher roles, 2) learning content, and 3) organising game jams in schools. The findings form a basis for further pedagogical studies on game jamming and practical implementation of game jams in formal education."
CAMPBELL2022e09191,Impact of a Scratch programming intervention on student engagement in a Nigerian polytechnic first-year class: verdict from the observers,"An engaging first programming class (CS1) often inspires students’ passion for computer science (CS). However, the evidence in the literature suggests that the average CS1 classes are anything but engaging for many students. The performance of CS compared to other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses in international student engagement surveys seems to substantiate CS1 failure, attrition rates, and lack of diversity in most CS classes. Meanwhile, for its simplicity in introducing programming to beginners, primary and secondary schools use Scratch, an educational programming environment developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. For the same reason, higher institutions now include some forms of Scratch instruction in CS1. The question remains, to what extent is Scratch engaging, especially for students in higher education? This study addressed this gap by observing college computer science students exposed to a constructionist Scratch programming pedagogy. We adopted a descriptive design based on quantitative observations. To observe the class during a weekly 2-hour session, we employed five CS educators, one observer per week. Each observer, employing a 20-item observation protocol, rated the extent of affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement of first-year CS students in a polytechnic in North Central Nigeria. Most of the students were learning to program for the first time. Analysis of the data showed a significant agreement in the ratings of the five observers for overall student engagement, although the impact was moderate. However, while agreement in their ratings for affective engagement was significant, with a large effect, there was no significant concordance in their ratings for behavioral engagement. Observers also significantly agreed in their ratings for cognitive engagement; however, the impact was moderate. These findings suggest that employing Scratch in higher education can be engaging and useful, especially for students with no prior programming experience."
CHEAH2025100363,"Integrating generative artificial intelligence in K-12 education: Examining teachers’ preparedness, practices, and barriers","Despite the growing body of research on developing K-12 teachers' generative AI (GenAI) knowledge and skills, its integration into daily teaching practices remains underexplored. Using a snowball sampling method, this study examined the preparedness, practices, and barriers encountered by 89 U.S. teachers in the state of Idaho. Participants were predominantly White, female teachers serving in rural schools. A mixed-methods analysis of survey responses revealed that teachers were generally underprepared for integrating GenAI, with fewer than half incorporating it into their educational practices. Unlike the widespread classroom integration patterns observed with general educational technologies, teachers in this study tended to use GenAI for out-of-classroom duties (i.e., lesson preparation, assessment, and administrative tasks) rather than for real-time teaching and learning. These preferences could be attributed to key barriers teachers faced, including doubts about GenAI's ability to manage risks (i.e., technology value beliefs), reduced human interaction in instruction (i.e., pedagogical beliefs), ethical considerations, and the absence of policies and guidance. This study highlights the need to develop support systems and targeted policies to facilitate teachers' GenAI integration, offering implications for Idaho's education system and the broader U.S. context."
HUANG2024105168,A systematic review of technology-enabled teacher professional development during COVID -19 pandemic,"Technologies have the potential to support and enable teacher professional development (TPD) programs for inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all (United Nations, 2023). This paper reviews the technology-enabled TPD programs that took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated their effectiveness on teachers' learning and professional growth. Drawing on the TPD@Scale model, we systematically analyzed the quality, equity, and efficiency dimensions of 37 technology-enabled TPD programs implemented during the pandemic. The findings demonstrate that technology-enabled TPD programs could develop teachers’ knowledge and skills critical to quality teaching during the pandemic and create environments that foster active learning and collaboration among teachers. However, there needs to be significant improvements in using technology to provide expert support and facilitate feedback and reflections. Furthermore, equity and efficiency were not specifically discussed in these TPD programs. Lessons learned from the present study have allowed us to provide recommendations to researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and educators."
MALINVERNI2025100727,Scaffolding Children's critical reflection on intelligent technologies: Opportunities from speculative fiction,"Current technological development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires educational practices that address the social and ethical implications derived from these emerging technologies. To this end, an increasing number of educational practices are pursuing the goal of supporting children's critical reflection on these topics. Our research aims at understanding how speculative fiction-based resources can meet and respond to the goals of supporting children's critical reflection on AI technologies and their impact on society. Through revisiting relevant literature on these topics and critically analyzing our own practices in three different settings, we identify a set of opportunities and challenges oriented at guiding the design of resources capable of taking advantage of speculative fiction as a way to support critical reflection."
CASADOMANSILLA2023102404,Remote experiments for STEM education and engagement in rural schools: The case of project R3,"Rural schools tend not to have enough laboratory and experimentation equipment, which can be an obstacle that hinders student learning in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas. Moreover, this loss of competencies can reduce their employment opportunities while society itself is deprived of that human capital. Remote laboratories have emerged as a way of countering the effects of insufficient investment in equipment or the inability to acquire the latter. By way of example, the goal of Project R3, which is presented in this article, is to reduce the absence or shortage of laboratories in the rural world via the use of remote experimentation. Specifically, this article presents the experience, the results, and the main conclusions of Project R3 during its first year of life. It is worth noting that Project R3 has been deployed not only in rural but also in urban environments, making it possible to compare learning results and satisfaction levels for students in both spheres and identify those experiments that provide the best learning experience and are most popular among pupils and teachers. The main objective is that from the local analysis (the Project has only been conducted in Spain) it might be possible to draw conclusions of a global nature that might be extrapolated to other countries in the European Union with similar socio-demographics. Initial results are in the direction of certifying that student achievement and satisfaction are higher in rural than in urban environments."
KOSIKOV2021492,Data Enrichment in the Information Graphs Environment Based on a Specialized Architecture of Information Channels,"The paper considers the possibility of constructing a specialized computing system oriented at the transmission of data through information channels, that are determined taking into account the semantics of the selected data. In the process of computations the data is connected with semantic characteristics that describe the channel of computations, which can be considered as a method of semantic data enrichment. The system of information channels as a whole can be considered as an information graph describing the structuring of the processed data. The information graph supports the data model in the form of a network, the framework of which are objects and the relationships between them. The paper proposes language tools for determining the information graph and interpretation tools that provide practical computations. The set of information channels that make up the information graph can be considered as a low-level tool for data enrichment. The paper studies the possibility of determining tools of higher level. An applicative type language is proposed for defining information graphs, the syntax and semantics of the language are specified. The proposed language can be considered as an intermediate level tool for defining semantics. A procedure is proposed for compiling the language into a low-level construct, preserving the semantics of the language. The supporting system for the proposed computing system includes a low-level language interpreter, as well as an intermediate-level language compiler into a low-level language. The supporting system is implemented in an applicative programming environment. Some elements of the supporting system were tested when developing applied information systems in the field of jurisprudence."
LIN2025100682,Review of research on design thinking in K-12 education,"Design thinking (DT) has drawn increasing attention in K-12 education. However, research on DT in K-12 education has not yet been comprehensively reviewed. The current review research attempted to bridge this gap in the field. Following the PRISMA guidelines, this review examined 40 empirical studies on DT in K-12 education, with specific emphasis on four key aspects: (1) research areas, (2) incorporation of DT into K-12 education, (3) methodologies, and (4) reported findings in reviewed studies. In terms of the first aspect, the main themes to analyze were identified as participant perspective, instructional intervention, learning assessment, and design mechanism. In terms of the second aspect, it was found that studies were conducted primarily in the context of design, technology, engineering, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education in middle schools and durations ranging from three days to nine weeks. In terms of the third aspect, these studies typically carried out qualitative analysis of documents and administered questionnaires, interviews, and observations. The articles described the development of questionnaires, online games, and scales to evaluate DT. In terms of the fourth aspect, the findings showed that DT was welcomed by most participants, and it was capable of optimizing learning processes and helped promote student learning. DT can be developed not only through DT courses but also through programming learning. The effective way to DT was explained through time allocation, modalities, and iteration sequence exploration. Based on the findings, it may be concluded that DT is still in an early development stage in K-12 education, and so research on DT has not yet been broadly established with academic content learning. More studies on subject content learning supported by various DT elements, instruction based on design mechanisms, and technology-supported assessment in K-12 education are needed to impact the educational practice of DT."
PALOMARESRUIZ2021121096,Digital gender gap in university education in Spain. Study of a case for paired samples,"This article presents a research with the aim of analyzing the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to promote the empowerment, entrepreneurship, and leadership of women in today's society. We examine the digital gender gap in undergraduate studies in Spain by branch of education and its relationship with the rate of affiliation to the Social Security of graduates of Degree and Cycle after one, two and three years from the completion of their university studies. It is completed with a case study for samples paired with a quasi-experimental method, to determine if the alternative hypothesis of gender inequality in the means of grades, as an assessment of academic performance, could be accepted between two orientations of the subject taught. The results showed, in the experimental group, a higher motivation and in learning higher scores, compared to the control group, not finding statistically significant gender differences in academic performance. As a conclusion, we propose the transformation of teaching-learning methodologies for greater student involvement and more meaningful and relevant learning that contributes to the disappearance of the digital gender gap and empowers women."
LIN2025102570,Effects of personalized approach on fourth-grade students’ academic performance in project-based learning,"Project-based learning (PjBL) has become a popular teaching method for 21st-century learning; however, academic performance improvement is a challenge. This study proposes a framework for designing personalized project-based learning (P-PjBL) experiences. To evaluate the effectiveness of P-PjBL, this study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, a two-tier diagnostic test was developed using data from over 1,000 students. Subsequently, students’ prior knowledge and understanding were assessed through the diagnostic test, and personalized activities and resources were created based on the test results. In the second stage, 106 fourth-grade students were divided into three groups and participated in a three-period unit. Control Group 1 followed traditional teaching methods, Control Group 2 engaged in general project-based learning (G-PjBL), and the Experimental Group used P-PjBL. The results indicated that P-PjBL can effectively improve academic performance and reduce the student performance gap. Notably, P-PjBL had a more positive effect on students with moderate prior knowledge than those with limited prior knowledge. Moreover, students with higher-level prior knowledge demonstrated greater improvement in P-PjBL than those with low-level prior knowledge. These findings provide valuable insight into the potential benefits of P-PjBL for improving academic performance."
BICER2025100905,Revealing student processes in a mathematics classroom: An in-depth instrumental case study,"This paper explores the creative processes that emerge in an elementary mathematics classroom and examines how the teacher incorporates creativity-directed practices. Using an instrumental case study approach, we analyzed the dynamics of creative engagement in mathematics lessons, considering whether this engagement occurred at the individual, collective, or both levels. The findings revealed that students had opportunities for creative involvement in both independent and collaborative settings. While the teacher's general instructional practices supported creative thinking, some challenges became evident. In particular, the teacher's limited understanding of how to foster creativity in mathematics posed obstacles to students' creative engagement. These findings highlight the need for professional development focused on mathematics-specific instructional strategies that help teachers better support students' creative thinking."
WANG2023458,The Hutong neighbourhood grammar: A procedural modelling approach to unravel the rationale of historical Beijing urban structure,"Hutong neighbourhoods, composed of Chinese courtyard dwellings (Siheyuan), are historically and socially significant urban spaces that embody the traditional Chinese way of life and philosophy. As part of the national heritage, there is an increasing research interest in Hutong neighbourhoods, many of which are facing oblivion. This study presents a formal grammar for Hutong neighbourhood generation. This research investigates traditional principles of urban planning of ancient Beijing, based on examples on the historical map Qianlong Jingcheng Quantu, to derive the lost design rules. These rules are used to build up a procedural modelling framework, which reveals the development of Beijing's urban structure from the Yuan (1271–1368) to the Qing (1644–1911) dynasty. Our findings present a grammar incorporated into the procedural modelling framework to parametrically generate Hutong neighbourhoods, which replicates the morphological characteristics of historic cases. It contributes to the understanding of the generation of Hutong neighbourhoods. In support of heritage sustainability, this grammar can be implemented in a computational environment by visual scripting that enables the generation of new instances of Hutong neighbourhoods, both real and virtual."

YANG2021100008,Human-centered artificial intelligence in education: Seeing the invisible through the visible,"The inevitable rise and development of artificial intelligence (AI) was not a sudden occurrence. The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives."
MAHAJAN2023100801,COVID-19 and management education: From pandemic to endemic,"The disruption in management education caused by COVID-19 was significant, creating a noteworthy impetus for new research. Given that COVID-19 has transitioned from pandemic to endemic, it is an opportune time to retrospect the contributions of related research to shape the future of management education. Using the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, a systematic literature review was conducted on management education research relating to COVID-19 published between 2020 and 2022. A total of 56 relevant articles were found in and retrieved from the Web of Science database and subsequently analyzed using descriptive and content analyses. The descriptive analysis revealed a steep increase in research on the impact of COVID-19 on management education over time, with most research appearing in The International Journal of Management Education. The contributions came from various countries, with the top five being the USA, the UK, Australia, India, and China. The content analysis showed that most research adopted empirical methodologies while self-determination theory emerged as the most popular theoretical lens for study. The related research revolved around five major themes—i.e., digital teaching and learning, collaboration and partnership, embracing uncertainty and building resilience, transformation and innovation, and developing an entrepreneurial mindset—and provided implications for management education in the new normal, wherein the priority is focused on enhancing education quality and preparing future business leaders for profound challenges in the new normal, thereby necessitating the development of innovative pedagogies and leadership competencies."
FERNANDEZ2025100698,The design space of visualization tools for data science education: Literature review and framework for future designs,"Data science education is a rapidly growing field, motivating the development of several tools aimed at engaging students in data-related activities across all educational levels. Within this landscape, new block-based programming (BBP) environments have been developed to integrate data visualization functionalities. However, the construction of visualizations entails distinct goals and forms of interaction from those typically used in conventional programming, which should be considered in designing those environments. Drawing inspiration from taxonomies within the field of Information Visualization, we derived a framework for the analysis of educational tools in this domain comprising four categories: supported goals, expressiveness, abstraction, and transparency. We situate six existing BBP environments within the design space of the framework and illustrate its application by describing the design of PlayData, a BBP environment developed to address a gap in data visualization tools for young audiences. Our goal is to contribute to a more theoretically grounded discussion on the topic by connecting well-established research on professional tools for data visualization and the design of related educational environments targeted at middle and high school students."
KURENT2023e13738,Examining pre-service teachers regulation in distance and traditional preschool design and technology education,"The significance of adapting to a rapidly changing world is quite evident in the current day; thus, the awareness of how to teach students so that they can be ready to face challenges in the future is very important. Early education has a huge impact on the further development of children, so preschool teachers must be competent and use appropriate teaching and educational methods. In this study, the development of self-directed learning (SDL) of future preschool teachers is investigated by considering two variables, namely the type of study (full-time and part-time students) and the learning modalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-, during and post-COVID-19 confinement). We collected data from 418 participants and analysed them using descriptive statistics, 2 × 3 factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a two-step cluster analysis. The results show the status of pre-service preschool teachers' perceptions of their SDL development and how the variables influenced it. There were significant differences in the students' self-reported SDL skills, depending on the learning environment and the type of study. The status indicator helps educators identify and change the curriculum and how they work with students. It allows the faculty to highlight the positive aspects of the different educational modalities encountered, as well as the characteristics of the study types and their impact on the learning process to improve students’ SDL skills. The results of the study may help in the design of tailored metacognitive scaffolds that take into account different modalities. Further studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of digital open learning environments that address both SDL and preschool educational practices."
SHARIFI2025105879,The metaverse as a future form of smart cities: A systematic literature review of co-benefits and trade-offs for sustainable development goals,"The United Nations launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to address a multitude of complex challenges facing today's world. Concurrently, the concept of smart cities has evolved to embrace advanced digital technologies and artificial intelligence for urban management and sustainability. Within this context, the Metaverse has emerged as a virtual extension of smart cities, offering a revolutionary space to reimagine urban life and governance. This systematic review explores how the Metaverse, as a virtual form of smart cities, aligns with the SDGs. It focuses on identifying potential co-benefits and trade-offs between the Metaverse and SDGs. The results indicate that research primarily focuses on SDGs related to health, education, innovation, sustainable cities, and responsible consumption and production. In contrast, less attention is given to SDGs related to reducing inequalities, climate change, environmental sustainability, peace, and partnership. The synthesis highlights the potential of the Metaverse to enhance smart cities' operational efficiency, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making through big data analytics and virtual collaboration. However, it also identifies risks such as exacerbating disparities and increasing environmental burdens. While the Metaverse can offer transformative solutions for smart urban environments, its benefits must be balanced with equitable access and environmental sustainability to effectively contribute to the SDGs. This requires addressing the digital and technological divide and environmental concerns to foster inclusive urban societies that uphold peace, justice, and strong institutions. The review underscores the need for strategic policy frameworks to mitigate risks and maximize the positive impact of the Metaverse on sustainable and resilient urban development."
VELENTZA2021104272,Learn with surprize from a robot professor,"In the years to come social robots will be extensively used in the teaching field. Consequently, it is important to determine how these robots can optimally interact with students. This paper specifically looks at the performance of social robots in place of university professors, in the field of engineering, measuring three outcomes, enjoyment (questionnaire), the acquisition of knowledge (academic test after class and final exam grades) and level of surprise (facial expressions monitored by cameras). Inspired by previous cognitive studies which have evidenced that feelings of surprise and familiarity affect the learning process, the hypothesis of this research is that robot-tutors will increase student's enjoyment. Leading the research to question whether higher levels of enjoyment strongly correlate with a higher acquisition of knowledge through a series of three experiments. Using the same subject material, three variables were tested: 1. one robot-tutor lecture, 2. one human-tutor lecture, 3. two robot-tutor lectures. Initial findings showed that students lectured by a human-tutor once, acquired a higher level of knowledge compared to those lectured by a robot-tutor once. However, those in the robot-tutor lecture shared higher levels of enjoyment as well as increased expressions of surprise. When students were lectured by a robot-tutor for the second time, results showed both a higher level of acquired knowledge and enjoyment and a drop in expressed surprise, compared to both, one human-tutor lecture and one robot-tutor lecture or one robot-tutor lecture. We conclude that high levels of surprise distracted students initially but once overcome, acted as motivation to study."
BOUVRY2025105081,The European master for HPC curriculum,"The use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) is crucial for addressing various grand challenges. While significant investments are made in digital infrastructures that comprise HPC resources, its realisation, operation, and, in particular, its use critically depends on suitably trained experts. In this paper, we present the results of an effort to design and implement a pan-European reference curriculum for a master's degree in HPC."
PARVIZ2024100190,AI in education: Comparative perspectives from STEM and Non-STEM instructors,"The integration of artificial intelligence into education has emerged as a promising avenue for enriching teaching and learning experiences. Nevertheless, the successful implementation of artificial intelligence in educational contexts hinges upon various factors, one of which is the perspective of instructors. With this in mind, this study aimed to examine the perspectives of 536 instructors in STEM and non-STEM disciplines regarding AI integration. The respondents’ thoughts, opinions, and concerns regarding advantages, disadvantages and challenges were gathered through an online questionnaire featuring both closed and open-ended questions. Additionally, a series of semi-structured interview sessions were conducted with a cohort of instructors to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The findings revealed that both STEM and non-STEM instructors expressed positive attitudes toward the integration of AI technologies into education. However, notable differences in responses and concerns were also identified in relation to the perceived capabilities and limitations of AI technologies within educational contexts. The results further elucidated a spectrum of opinions on the benefits (e.g., scalability and tirelessness), drawbacks (e.g., deepfake technology and comfort-seeking behavior), and potential challenges (e.g., educational disillusionment and espionage) associated with AI integration. The study concluded by discussing the implications of these findings for STEM and non-STEM education and offering recommendations for the effective and ethical integration of AI technologies in classrooms."
CHOWDHURY2024100160,Digital game-based language learning for vocabulary development,"Current literature suggests that one of the impressive benefits of digital game-based language learning is its potential to create engaging vocabulary learning experiences. However, this literature is dominated by game-play approaches, rather than game-making approaches. Drawing upon constructivist, motivation, dual-coding, and constructionist theories, this study examined elementary English language learners’ vocabulary learning experiences in a game-based learning context and investigated their experience as they built their own games based on their understanding of different non-fiction texts. This mixed-methods case study involved novel use of network analysis to examine student learning, investigate the relationships between various aspects of learner experiences, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the program. Findings indicated that a complex set of interdependencies between enactments of theoretical principles including generativity, agency, tinkering, intrinsic motivation, and contextualized learning lead to enjoyment and powerful language learning experiences. Design principles for future digital game-based language learning include optimizing visual aspects, spending more time on technical skill development, increasing learner agency, and focusing more on generative and joyful learning experiences."
SUYANTO2022116857,A new nearest neighbor-based framework for diabetes detection,"Diabetes is one of the deadliest and costliest diseases. Today, automatic diabetes detection systems are primarily developed using deep learning (DL) approaches, which give high accuracy in classifying patients into two classes: have diabetes or not. Unfortunately, DL is a high-complexity and unexplainable black-box model. This paper proposes a new nearest neighbor-based framework to tackle those issues in classifying two diabetes datasets: binary-class Pima India Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) and multiclass Diabetes Type. A k-means clustering (KMC) is first carried out to remove the noises or outliers and keep the competent data in the training set. The dimension of the competent data is then reduced using an autoencoder (AE) to minimize the distances of the intra-class data but maximize that of the inter-class. A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and two variants: pseudo nearest neighbor rule (PNNR) and local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN), are used to detect diabetes. In addition, a new variant named multi-voter multi-commission nearest neighbor (MVMCNN) is introduced. An investigation based on 5-fold cross-validation (FCV) informs that, for binary-class PIDD, the proposed combination of KMC, AE, and MVMCNN achieves the highest accuracy of 99.13%, which is slightly higher than the state-of-the-art DL-based detection model that produces 98.07%. An evaluation based on 10-FCV also indicates that, for the multiclass Diabetes Type, it obtains a higher accuracy of 95.24% than the DL-based model for predicting diabetes that gives 94.02%."
BAIJNATH2023279,Implications of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the vortex of higher education in South Africa,"The paper explores the genesis and potential of the 4IR, and what it portends for a developing economy and society such as South Africa and its impact on the global stage. It reflects on the value that is promised for tertiary education, teaching, and learning. Separating hype from the realistic possibilities, the connections between advances in technology, policy, and development challenges are critically examined to consider how the 4IR could impact on tertiary education, and teaching and learning, in the future. It then proceeds to examine the enabling conditions which need to be cultivated at national, institutional, and individual levels, and the challenges and obstacles to be overcome at these levels, for enduring benefits to be realized. The paper explores what the phenomenon of the 4IR is, drawing on the arguments of key proponents, including skeptics. It explores what kinds of changes are envisaged as the phenomenon progresses. It then proceeds to examine how institutions may be positioned to harness the 4IR for the benefit of human wellbeing, and in support of national and international social and economic benefits. The promise of the 4IR to resolve our developmental challenges has been sharply questioned—perhaps being overhyped, given existing and enduring disadvantage and marginalization that was not ameliorated in previous industrial revolutions. These are elaborated upon. At the institutional level, more sophisticated use of digital technology is called for—in administration, teaching, learning support, and e-learning. Online data and information management; aggregation of vast amounts of data; and analyses of data for student success and student support promise a positive impact on success and throughput rates. Key imperatives for action include redesigning, streamlining, and aligning the education system. This requires flexibility in admission criteria, curriculum design, learning and teaching modes, and assessment, with appropriate support systems and services across the institution."
KONG2024100328,Examining teachers’ behavioural intention of using generative artificial intelligence tools for teaching and learning based on the extended technology acceptance model,"The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has given rise to a growing discussion of the potential challenges and benefits that the use of these technologies may present in the field of education. This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings."
CHANG2024103484,Evaluating AI's impact on self-regulated language learning: A systematic review,"AI technology is reshaping language classrooms, prompting students to adopt flexible roles exhibiting linguistic competence and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills. Considerable studies explore the necessary integrated learning perspectives, emphasizing AI's adaptive role as a mind tool. In AI-mediated language learning, the technology's metacognitive importance enables students to learn with AI as a partner, encouraging independent critical thinking. Within Zimmerman's SRL model, AI as a mind tool is integrated for improving language students' strategic employment in a cyclical process. A systematic review, following PRISMA protocols, examines the intersection of AI and self-regulated language learning (SRLL) over 2000–2022. Findings highlight AI's evolving role, predominantly through algorithms and systems, aiming for micro and macro integration. Interactive AI has not fully engaged in two-way directions, despite a familiar process approach in reviewed studies. In the favored ESL/EFL research context, task-specific AI is utilized to encourage cyclical improvement with learner autonomy enhancement mainly among higher education students at intermediate level or above. Pedagogical values are possible when major SRL phases are fully practiced, even without highly autonomous AI. Future research is directed toward adaptive personalized technology by exploring the dynamic interplay between AI technologies and SRLL as educational practices under Education 4.0 principles."
LI2024101590,Transforming maker mindsets: A case study of elementary students in a maker education context during lesson study,"Utilizing a case study approach, this research investigates the transformation of elementary students' Maker mindsets within the context of Maker education through a lesson study cycle. The study focuses on the Maker mindsets transformation of three students with varying abilities, deliberately chosen as information-rich participants. A project-specific questionnaire, the Maker Mindsets Scale, was employed to facilitate self-assessment of Maker mindsets before and after intervention. Additionally, teachers' post-lesson discussion meetings were observed, and semi-structured interviews with participating teachers were conducted to gauge their perceptions of students' Maker mindsets transformation. The analysis encompassed students' semi-structured reflection logs and interviews to uncover the underlying factors driving Maker mindsets transformation. The results revealed distinct variations in how students of different abilities perceived their Maker mindsets transformation. Nonetheless, participant teachers consistently observed transformations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) thinking skills, self-efficacy, motivation, and collaborative learning across all students. The study further identifies a collaborative convergence of multiple factors contributing to Maker mindsets transformation, spanning teacher, student, and pedagogical perspectives. These findings carry significant implications for educators, advocating for the implementation of customized strategies, authentic contextualization, structured methodologies, and collaborative frameworks to holistically nurture Maker mindsets evolution. Moreover, our study underscores the practicality of the LS approach in fostering collaborative development of innovative pedagogical strategies aimed at fostering Maker mindsets formation."
MERRITT2024103670,Igniting kid power: The impact of environmental service-learning on elementary students' awareness of energy problems and solutions,"Energy concepts are taught in many schools, but children rarely have an opportunity to grapple with energy problems and work on their own solutions. This study explores the impacts of Connect Science, a service-learning (SL) program developed to enhance elementary students' energy literacy in the United States. Program impacts were explored within the context of a randomized controlled trial. Teachers in the SL intervention group were provided with professional development, coaching and curricular materials. Each fourth grade class chose an energy problem to address, and designed projects to test out a solution. Teachers in a waitlist control group taught their typical energy unit. Upon completion of the unit, students were asked to write about a problem related to energy production or use and propose a potential solution. Inductive content analysis was used to code 703 student responses (377 from control group and 326 from SL group). The majority of students expressed concerns about wasting or using too much electricity or the use of nonrenewable energy sources. Solutions focused on energy conservation and the use of renewable or clean resources were mentioned most frequently overall. Students in the SL group were significantly more likely to mention environmental impacts of various energy sources and to suggest energy conservation solutions or educating others. Conversely, the control group student responses more often focused on electric circuits or electrical safety. Results from this study suggest the promise of environmental SL programs to advance energy literacy and promote critical thinking about how to address energy problems."
CAMACHOLIE202435,Development of basic thermodynamics workshops integrating a cubic equations of state simulator and MATLAB Grader courses,"This paper describes the development of EoS Simulator, a cubic equations of state simulator created in the MATLAB R2022b App Designer platform, which aims to be a practical digital tool for chemical engineering students that facilitates the solution, analysis, and critical thinking about thermodynamic problems. In the simulator, numerical algorithms were implemented based on a theoretical framework, such as fugacity test, bracketing methods, and the calculation of residual properties. EoS Simulator can estimate two-phase envelopes, isobars, isotherms, and surfaces related to PTVHS properties. MATLAB Grader courses were proposed to test student learning using the software in two different workshops. The evaluation was based on the achievement of tasks related to intended learning outcomes. Survey responses about the simulator and learning environment were collected, concluding that most students improved their skills in understanding thermodynamics phenomena, but some improvements are necessary for future versions of the software and online courses."
LI2024102009,BERT-based transfer learning in tacit knowledge externalization: A study case of history teachers,"There has been significant progress in the field of transfer learning. However, there are still issues with inconsistent results in professional domain applications, with low-resource learning being a considerable problem. This paper proposes a language processing model for historical education built using BERT's pre-training techniques. Two experiments were conducted to obtain comparative results and choose the appropriate model method for explicating implicit expertise in secondary school history teaching. It compares traditional methods, represented by naive Bayes, to popular continuation pre-processing techniques such as domain adaptive learning and task adaptive learning to improve the effectiveness of transfer learning. Finally, this study builds targeted models based on real application needs and selects professional rules consistent with the scene application. The use of continued pre-training helps to enhance the accuracy of the professional domain model."
FANG2024293,Quantifying structural distortion manipulation for desired perovskite phase: Part I. Paradigm demonstration in tungsten oxides,"Slight distortions can cause dramatic changes in the properties of crystalline perovskite materials and their derivatives. Due to the numerous types of distortions and unclarified distortion-structure relations, a quantitative distortion manipulation for the desired crystalline phase of perovskite materials suitable for various application remains challenging. Here, by establishing parameter sets to systematically describe the types, magnitudes and positional relations involved in distortions, we are able to interpret the structural regulations and manipulation strategies in 7 reported crystal systems. Through the construction of distortion-phase-property functional curves, we further propose a paradigm to quantify the structural distortion manipulation for desired perovskite phases. Using the example of perovskite-like tungsten oxides, we successfully quantify their volume shrinkage and symmetry increase during lithiation. This work verifies that the complicated research and development of perovskite materials can be simplified into a mathematical problem solving process, which will inspire researchers with different backgrounds to participate, especially mathematicians and computer scientists."
TEGALLY20233277,Dispersal patterns and influence of air travel during the global expansion of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,"Summary
The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) co-circulated globally during 2020 and 2021, fueling waves of infections. They were displaced by Delta during a third wave worldwide in 2021, which, in turn, was displaced by Omicron in late 2021. In this study, we use phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods to reconstruct the dispersal patterns of VOCs worldwide. We find that source-sink dynamics varied substantially by VOC and identify countries that acted as global and regional hubs of dissemination. We demonstrate the declining role of presumed origin countries of VOCs in their global dispersal, estimating that India contributed <15% of Delta exports and South Africa <1%–2% of Omicron dispersal. We estimate that >80 countries had received introductions of Omicron within 100 days of its emergence, associated with accelerated passenger air travel and higher transmissibility. Our study highlights the rapid dispersal of highly transmissible variants, with implications for genomic surveillance along the hierarchical airline network."
MOREIRA2023102107,A social and technical sustainability requirements catalogue,"Climate change calls for action from all sectors of our global economy, including ICT. Therefore, it is important to change the way we develop software to address the challenges posed by sustainability. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability requirements catalogue that helps developers be aware of sustainability-related properties worth considering during software development. The information for this catalogue was gathered via a systematic mapping study, whose results were synthesised in feature models and then modelled using iStar for a more expressive and configurable representation. A qualitative evaluation of the catalogue’s readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain, showed that around 79% of the respondents found the catalogue “Good” or “Very Good”. However, more than 5% of the expert participants found weaknesses regarding most of the evaluated questions and around 25% are neutral in their overall evaluation. This led us to evolve the initial version of the catalogue for the social and technical dimensions of sustainability to improve its completeness and usefulness. This is achieved by aligning the information gathered in the systematic mapping study with the well-established quality model of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011, as we expect most of the experts are familiar with those qualities and respective hierarchies. During this process, we found information that led us to propose two additional qualities that were not covered by the ISO standard: fairness and legislation. We applied this evolved version of the catalogue to the U-Bike project comparing the requirements elicited without the catalogue with those identified using the catalogue. The result suggests that new sustainability requirements were worth considering from a sustainability point of view, supporting the usefulness of the catalogue."
MIRANDA2024100312,Machine learning's model-agnostic interpretability on the prediction of students' academic performance in video-conference-assisted online learning during the covid-19 pandemic,"Background
COVID-19 prompted a global shift to online learning, including video conference-assisted online learning (VCAOL), which necessitated educators understanding students' perspectives.
Objective
This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) model-agnostic interpretability that could predict students' academic performance in VCAOL.
Material and methods
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and data augmentation were used to handle imbalanced data from small-scale datasets. The prediction model was developed using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). SHAP model-agnostic interpretability was used to interpret and comprehend prediction findings. The data was gathered from September 2022 to January 2023, resulting in 361 records. The research variables included students' academic performance as the dependent variable, and the video conference application (VC), learning material (LM), internet connection (IC), students' ability to learn (SL), and student knowledge (SK) as independent variables, which were mapped into 28 attributes.
Result
The SMOTE improved the performance of three algorithms, with RF outperforming SVM and GNB in almost all tests, achieving an accuracy of 79.45%, precision of 75.71%, and recall of 79.45%. SHAP bar plots ranked attributes by importance demonstrated that “Performance,” “Frequency Constraint,” and “Increase Value” had a significant impact on prediction results. When we mapped the three attributes to our study perspective, we determined that SK and SL were the most important views for students to perform well in VCAOL. SHAP's beeswarm revealed students' performance in VCAOL was positively correlated with “Performance”, “Increase Value”, “Completing Project”, “Adequate Method”, “User Interface”, and “Feature”. As we mapped the three attributes to our study perspective, we found that SK, LM, SL, and VC were positively related to students' performance in VCAOL.
Conclusion
The study highlighted the potential of ML in developing data-driven decision-making tools for predicting students' academic performance and identifying critical attributes in a prediction model."
CHAUHAN2023298,Promoting engineering research with entrepreneurship and industry experiences: a teacher professional development program,"Under a project-based learning environment, this effort created a professional development program that provided teachers training in mechatronics and robotics; immersion in collaborative research; a framework for standards-aligned lessons development; and experiences to cultivate entrepreneurial abilities and interact with industry engineers. Over its 3-year duration, the effort engendered experiential learning to enrich teachers' STEM experience, cultivate their familiarity with new concepts and skills, and foster a professional learning community. Teachers brought their learning to schools by implementing new lessons and encouraging students to participate in an entrepreneurial contest, promoting real-world STEM learning, and increasing student motivation to pursue STEM disciplines."

We will explain the authentic STEM learning environment, supply background, and the application of the framework of standards, provide a guide to best practices and lessons-learned, give examples of exemplary projects, and emphasize the importance of scholarly evaluation. Finally, we will show the need to create or identify “next step” authentic STEM connections for students to keep practicing and acquiring relevant knowledge and skills moving towards their career pathway."
ASTLE2023726,Toward computational neuroconstructivism: a framework for developmental systems neuroscience,"Brain development is underpinned by complex interactions between neural assemblies, driving structural and functional change. This neuroconstructivism (the notion that neural functions are shaped by these interactions) is core to some developmental theories. However, due to their complexity, understanding underlying developmental mechanisms is challenging. Elsewhere in neurobiology, a computational revolution has shown that mathematical models of hidden biological mechanisms can bridge observations with theory building. Can we build a similar computational framework yielding mechanistic insights for brain development? Here, we outline the conceptual and technical challenges of addressing this theory gap, and demonstrate that there is great potential in specifying brain development as mathematically defined processes operating within physical constraints. We provide examples, alongside broader ingredients needed, as the field explores computational explanations of system-wide development."
WEISBERGER2021103344,How do technological changes in formal education shape the social roles of teachers who are mothers?,"The teaching profession has become more demanding as a result of technology integration in teaching-learning-assessment processes. These changes are particularly challenging for teachers-mothers. This study aimed at understanding how technological changes that are integrated in the teaching profession shape the social roles of teachers-mothers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of thirty teachers-mothers. The analysis revealed main themes related to pedagogical aspects of technology integration, online professional development, and work-related e-communication. In addition, the categories of blurred boundaries, multichannel communication, and less free time were related to teachers-mothers’ social roles. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
WESTERBERG2022105473,Home science interactions and their relation to children’s science core knowledge in preschool,"A limited body of work has examined the nature and scope of young children’s science-related activities outside of the school context, and thus there is little understanding or consensus regarding what comprises the home science environment (HSE; e.g., interactions, activities, resources) and how specific factors of the HSE relate to children’s science performance. The two primary goals of this study were to (a) examine the factor structure of a parent-report measure of home science interactions and (b) evaluate how these factors relate to the science core knowledge of young children from families with low incomes. A total of 125 families with children aged 3 to 5 years (52 girls) participated in the study. Children were assessed on a measure of science core knowledge, and parents completed a brief questionnaire on their home science interactions that included questions pertaining to both home science disciplinary core idea (DCI) engagement and home science and engineering practice (SEP) engagement. Findings revealed that although separating home science interactions into distinct DCI and SEP factors represented the data well, the best overall representation of home science interactions was a one-factor model that included only home DCI engagement items. In addition, home DCI engagement was significantly predictive of children’s science core knowledge over and above a large group of covariates, including children’s age, race/ethnicity, sex, and performance on math, executive function, and vocabulary tasks as well as their parents’ education."
SINGH2025127988,An Empirical Approach to Investigate the Impact of Technical and Non-technical Parameters on Programmers’ Code Comprehension Proficiency,"Technical skills are widely used as a benchmark for assessing the code comprehension proficiency of programmers in software maintenance. While several studies have focused on technical skills, only a few have considered the integration of non-technical skills alongside technical skills to evaluate programmers’ code comprehension proficiency. Therefore, the main objective of our work is to analyze the impact of non-technical skills such as emotions, problem-solving ability, and long-term memory capability alongside technical know-how on the code comprehension proficiency of programmers. An empirical study was conducted using two approaches: C1 (traditional) and C2 (proposed), to determine the comprehension measure index of 158 participants and classify them into various levels of expertise. Approach C1 computes the comprehension measure index based solely on technical data, while the proposed approach C2 incorporates both technical and non-technical data for assessment and classification. The results reveal a significant change of 58.22% in the expertise classification of participants, with 92 out of 158 participants showing a shift in their classification when non-technical skills (approach C2) were considered alongside technical skills. The case studies presented in this work emphasize the importance of integrating non-technical skills with technical skills when evaluating code comprehension abilities. Moreover, our study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of participants in both technical and non-technical aspects, providing valuable insights that can help instructors and managers adopt more targeted and effective strategies to hone participants’ overall code comprehension skills."
DELAHERA2022105335,Peer tutoring of computer programming increases exploratory behavior in children,"There is growing interest in teaching computer science and programming skills in schools. Here we investigated the efficacy of peer tutoring, which is known to be a useful educational resource in other domains but never before has been examined in such a core aspect of applied logical thinking in children. We compared (a) how children (N = 42, age range = 7 years 1 month to 8 years 4 months) learn computer programming from an adult versus learning from a peer and (b) the effect of teaching a peer versus simply revising what has been learned. Our results indicate that children taught by a peer showed comparable overall performance—a combination of accuracy and response times—to their classmates taught by an adult. However, there was a speed–accuracy trade-off, and peer-taught children showed more exploratory behavior, with shorter response times at the expense of lower accuracy. In contrast, no tutor effects (i.e., resulting from teaching a peer) were found. Thus, our results provide empirical evidence in support of peer tutoring as a way to help teach computer programming to children. This could contribute to the promotion of a widespread understanding of how computers operate and how to shape them, which is essential to our values of democracy, plurality, and freedom."
WESTERBERG2021100981,Concurrent predictors of science core knowledge in preschool,"There is little empirical evidence on cross-domain relations with science and other academic domains, which contributes to a limited understanding of the development of early science and how to best support it. The purpose of this study was to examine multiple concurrent predictors of science core knowledge, including executive functioning (EF), vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language in preschool. This study overcomes the limitations of previous work exploring relations between individual predictors, by addressing potentially spurious relations due to acting as proxies for other variables. Data were collected from 86 preschool-aged children (36 female) from families with low incomes. Findings revealed that when EF, vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language were included in the same model as concurrent predictors of science, only vocabulary significantly predicted children’s science core knowledge. Findings from this study have potential implications for the refinement of early science skills and intervention development."
TAN2025100355,Artificial intelligence in teaching and teacher professional development: A systematic review,"The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in education is increasingly recognized as a key driver of educational innovation. While extensive literature exists on the integration of AI technologies in educational settings, less emphasis has been placed on the critical role of teachers and their professional development needs. This study systematically reviews research conducted between 2015 and 2024 on teachers' use of AI technology in their teaching and professional development, focusing on the relationship between the supply of professional development opportunities and the demand for AI integration among teachers. Using PRISMA principles and protocols, this review identified and synthesized 95 relevant research articles. The findings reveal a significant imbalance in research focus. Specifically, 65% of the studies examined the application of AI in teaching, including technologies such as conversational AI and related technologies, AI-driven learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies, visual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. In contrast, only 35% of the studies explored AI's role in enhancing teacher professional development. This review highlights a gap in research addressing the development needs of teachers as they integrate AI technologies into their teaching practices. It emphasizes the need for future research to focus more on the potential of AI in teacher professional development and to investigate how AI technologies can be applied in education from both the perspectives of student learning and teacher instruction. Furthermore, research on AI in professional development should prioritize addressing technological and ethical challenges to ensure the responsible and effective integration of AI in education."
TISZA2020100184,Patterns in informal and non-formal science learning activities for children–A Europe-wide survey study,"There is a growing number of informal and non-formal learning activities worldwide related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) curricular subject areas—particularly those involving coding and making. To better understand the general aim and content of such activities, we conducted a survey addressing highly experienced instructional designers and instructors of informal and non-formal science learning activities in nine European countries (N = 128). The goal of this paper is to investigate the relation between the gender of the activity leader experts, the target audience, the covered curricular subjects, the main goal, and the place of the activity. The results show that the gender and age of the participants are related to the covered curricular subjects and to the goal of the activity, and that the place of the activity is associated with all of the investigated dimensions. We introduce the patterns we identified that describe typical goals and the covered curricular subjects in relation to the participants’ gender and age along with patterns between the activity leader experts’ gender, the covered curricular subjects, and the main goal of the activity, as well as relationships between the studied dimensions and the place of the activity. Furthermore, we discuss the best practices and the bottlenecks of the activities, as well as detailed study findings regarding the revealed patterns, in addition to their implications and value for the informal and non-formal learning communities."
ROBINSON2024100087,"Infrastructural justice for responsible software engineering,","In recent years, we have seen many examples of software products unintentionally causing demonstrable harm. Many guidelines for ethical and responsible computing have been developed in response. Dominant approaches typically attribute liability and blame to individual companies or actors, rather than understanding how the working practices, norms, and cultural understandings in the software industry contribute to such outcomes. In this paper, we propose an understanding of responsibility that is infrastructural, relational, and cultural; thus, providing a foundation to better enable responsible software engineering into the future. Our approach draws on Young's (2006) social connection model of responsibility and Star and Ruhleder's (1994) concept of infrastructure. By bringing these theories together we introduce a concept called infrastructural injustice, which offers a new way for software engineers to consider their opportunities for responsible action with respect to society and the planet. We illustrate the utility of this approach by applying it to an Open-Source software communities’ development of Deepfake technology, to find key leverage points of responsibility that are relevant to both Deepfake technology and software engineering more broadly."
SUN2023100546,A systematic literature review of teacher scaffolding in game-based learning in primary education,"In recent years, research interest in games in education has experienced continuous growth. However, although prior reviews in this context have generally focused on providing an overview of research trends and the impact of game-based learning on education, they have failed to provide noncrucial information on teacher scaffolding strategies used in the different stages of game-based learning and its related effects on students' learning in primary education. By conducting a systematic search of databases, the current review examines recent empirical studies, ranging from 2011 to the end of March 2022, that implemented game-based learning in primary education settings. Twenty-four relevant papers were selected by deploying a four-phase PRISMA framework. This review identified different teacher scaffolding strategies that are used in teacher–student interactions during the orientation and gameplay stages, and their correlative influence on students’ learning. These findings can help teachers, teacher educators, and game developers in designing and developing improved game-based learning. The requirement for more research to investigate the use of teacher scaffolding in teacher–student interactions within the game-based learning process in primary education is emphasized. Furthermore, recommendations are offered for the future implementation of teacher scaffolding in game-based learning research."
CAMARGO2024326,VISO approach: A socialization proposal for the Internet of Things objects,"Amidst the ongoing technological expansion, IoT-based applications have established their presence in various scenarios, including smart homes, healthcare, wearable devices, and more. However, fostering robust social relationships among objects within intelligent environments requires considering a multitude of parameters, from historical transactions data to peer opinions on interaction experiences. Our primary objective is to introduce the VISO concept, a finely tuned approach for community formation and facilitating autonomous interactions among Social IoT objects. Key contributions of VISO include: (i) a recommendation mechanism for cultivating friendships; (ii) the virtualization of devices, known as Virtual Objects, based on the Digital Twin concept; (iii) object ranking, determined by peer evaluations at the edge; and (iv) profiling the identity of each object within the environment. The VISO approach is rooted in the link analysis model, which seeks to uncover connections between individuals and qualify interactions. Additionally, the construction of social circles is guided by the Organizational Network Analysis model, a concept grounded in social networks designed to simplify the initiation of new friendships. The VISO approach stands out through its amalgamation of dynamic trust mechanisms, object virtualization, real-time interaction monitoring, and the highlighting of the most active objects. These characteristics collectively contribute to its effectiveness in managing relationships within the social IoT, while simultaneously addressing challenges posed by alternative models. Preliminary results in a testing environment substantiate the model’s capability to categorize interactions and identify the most beneficial object roles for establishing new relationships. In particular, by selecting the most active objects 30%, they account for a staggering 90% of local actions. These validation outcomes lay the foundation for planned future work and enhancements to the VISO approach. Encouraged by the promising results, the inception of a significant project is on the horizon. The application of the VISO approach to relationship management within a smart campus for ubiquitous education underscores the remarkable versatility and potential of Social IoT. This application has the power to elevate various facets of campus life, ranging from education to resource management, creating a transformative impact within the educational landscape."
PRINSLOO2023102901,"System dynamics characterisation and synthesis of floating photovoltaics in terms of energy, environmental and economic parameters with WELF nexus sustainability features","The invention of floatovoltaic technologies brought new meaning to the theoretical framing of sustainability as the technology delivers extended natural resource conservation benefits. However, planning assessments for this novel sustainable energy technology exposed knowledge gaps jeopardising global financial investments and regulatory approvals. Knowledge and methodological gaps cause inaccurate performance predictions in current geospatial-engineering modelling tools and fail to adequately quantify the diverse range of layered performance qualities and impacts of floating photovoltaics. This paper advances a geo-sensitive system dynamics framework to systemically integrate the energy, environmental and economic domain object functions in characterising the behaviour and sustainability of floating photovoltaic systems theoretically. The framework serves as computer logic in a geospatial digital twin to synthesise floatovoltaic operations to predict the technology’s sustainability impact and offset attributes in balanced scorecard metrics and water–energy–land–food nexus indicators. Experimental evaluations with the proposed framework in a real-world setting demonstrate the value of the holistically integrated framework in analytical floatovoltaic project appraisal and planning support. The results highlight significant advantages when comparing a 1000 m2 floatovoltaic system with a similar-sized conventional photovoltaic alternative, including a 19.3% lifetime energy gain, a carbon emission displacement of CO2e=5168t and a freshwater evaporation benefit of 983 kL. Predictive energy, environmental and economic modelling also offers water–energy–land–food–resource analysis parameters, thus delivering multi-attribute performance profiles that solve many of the current problems with the “technology unknowns” of floatovoltaics that impede energy project commissioning and licensing approvals."
YU2025100172,"Modular AI agents for transportation surveys and interviews: Advancing engagement, transparency, and cost efficiency","Surveys and interviews—structured, semi-structured, or unstructured—are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. For example, distributed questionnaires lack the ability to provide real-time guidance and request immediate clarifications. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents. This issue underscors the need for a rigorous, explainable, and resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a modular approach accompanied by a parameterized process for designing and deploying AI agents for surveys and interviews, thereby supporting decision-makings in high-stakes contexts. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultations about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns. We believe this work lays the foundation for next-generation surveys and interviews in transportation research."
DAVID2024105502,Understanding local government responsible AI strategy: An international municipal policy document analysis,"The burgeoning capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted numerous local governments worldwide to consider its integration into their operations. Nevertheless, instances of notable AI failures have heightened ethical concerns, emphasising the imperative for local governments to approach the adoption of AI technologies in a responsible manner. While local government AI guidelines endeavour to incorporate characteristics of responsible innovation and technology (RIT), it remains essential to assess the extent to which these characteristics have been integrated into policy guidelines to facilitate more effective AI governance in the future. This study closely examines local government policy documents (n = 26) through the lens of RIT, employing directed content analysis with thematic data analysis software. The results reveal that: (a) Not all RIT characteristics have been given equal consideration in these policy documents; (b) Participatory and deliberate considerations were the most frequently mentioned responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (c) Adaptable, explainable, sustainable, and accountable considerations were the least present responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (d) Many of the considerations overlapped with each other as local governments were at the early stages of identifying them. Furthermore, the paper summarised strategies aimed at assisting local authorities in identifying their strengths and weaknesses in responsible AI characteristics, thereby facilitating their transformation into governing entities with responsible AI practices. The study informs local government policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on the critical aspects of responsible AI policymaking."
CROMPTON2021100044,Developing instructional technology standards for educators: A design-based research study,"Digital technologies are key tools that can be used to extend and enhance teaching and learning. However, empirical evidence show educators are unclear how to integrate technology and it is often used to support past teaching practices. Designbased research (DBR) involving a grounded theory design was used to construct a set of seven detailed education technology standards to provide guidance on how technology should be integrated and a set of 24 examples as indicators of these standards. This DBR mixed methods approach involved 2429 participants and gathered data from focus groups, surveys, and interviews. The DBR involved two macro cycles of design, implementation, analysis, and revision within the development of the standards. These standards are unique as they are the first empirically developed instructional technology standards for educators."
PINKARD2025104705,Increasing STEM engagement through opportunity landscaping,"This paper outlines our approach to one city's opportunity landscape. The opportunity landscape involves collecting systems-driven data sets corresponding to organizations, places, barriers and supports that collectively shape the opportunities available to youth, families, and educators. Understanding and utilizing this landscape is crucial to fully accounting for youth progress along STEM pathways. Such awareness is vital as stakeholders often operate in silos and may not fully grasp how their impact areas within the ecosystem intersect with others. For example, how do school-based out-of-school time opportunities affect programming at local parks and libraries? How does reduced bus fare impact kids' ability to move around the city after school and on weekends? How do employers create pathways for entry-level staff? Our work aims to create a cohesive landscape that brings together stakeholders, their insights, and affordances and creates opportunities for all. This paper describes the design efforts that led to one city's summer 2023 youth STEM learning opportunities. We discuss the phases of our work and approach to collaborative design with community and organizational partners to apply insights and create opportunities that increase youth freedom of movement and access to resources. We provide specific examples to illustrate the impact of our design."
LIU2024105109,Profiling students’ learning engagement in MOOC discussions to identify learning achievement: An automated configurational approach,"In the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) forum, learning engagement encompasses three fundamental dimensions—cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement—that intricately interact to jointly influence students' learning achievements. However, the interplay between multiple engagement dimensions and their correlations with learning achievement remain understudied, particularly across different academic disciplines. This study adopts an automated configurational approach that integrates bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of learning engagement, their connections with learning achievement, and variations across disciplines. Our analysis reveals a nuanced profile of learners' learning engagement, indicating the high-achieving individuals demonstrated more frequent posting and commenting behaviors and the high-level cognitive engagement than low-achieving individuals. Second, our analysis revealed multiple configurations where the coexistence or absence of factors at different levels of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions significantly impacted learning achievement. Learners who conducted posting and replying behaviors, expressed positive emotions, and engaged in deep cognitive engagement tended to achieve superior learning outcomes. Third, there were significant differences in behavioral and emotional engagement among learners across different academic disciplines. Specifically, pure discipline learners were more inclined to engage in posting behaviors than the applied discipline learners. Across academic disciplines, positive emotions correlated strongly with higher achievement. These findings deepen our understanding of the multifaceted characteristics of learning engagement in MOOCs and highlight the importance of disciplinary distinctions, providing a foundation for educators and designers to optimize learners’ MOOC effects and tailor learning experiences in diverse disciplinary contexts."
CHENG2024104948,Exploring differences in self-regulated learning strategy use between high- and low-performing students in introductory programming: An analysis of eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data from program comprehension,"Previous studies have reported mixed results regarding the relationship between students’ use of self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies and their performance in introductory programming courses. These studies were constrained by their reliance on self-report questionnaires as a means of collecting and analysing data. To address this limitation, this study aimed to employ eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud techniques to identify differences in SRL strategy use for program comprehension tasks between high-performing students (N = 31) and low-performing students (N = 31) in an undergraduate programming course. All participants attended individual eye-tracking sessions to comprehend two Python program codes with different constructs. Their eye-tracking data and video-recalled retrospective think-aloud data were captured and recorded for analysis. The findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills, such as elaboration and critical thinking, were mostly adopted by high-performing students, while basic cognitive and resource management strategy, such as rehearsal and help-seeking, were mostly employed by low-performing students when comprehending the program codes. This study not only demonstrates the design of combining eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data to explore students’ use of SRL strategies but also provides evidence to support the notion that program comprehension is a complex process that cannot be effectively addressed by employing merely rudimentary strategies, such as repetitively reading the same code segment. In the future, researchers could explore the possibility of using a webcam to monitor and assess students’ online programming processes and provide feedback based on their eye movements. They could also examine the effects of SRL strategies training on students’ motivation, engagement, and performance in various types of programming activities."
LAI2023100178,Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation in ChatGPT adoption to support active learning: An extension of the technology acceptance model,"Background
ChatGPT, a powerful artificial intelligence chatbot, has great potential for active learning because of its ability to generate instant responses to academic inquiries and foster spontaneous interactions.
Purpose
This exploratory study investigated the roles of intrinsic motivation and factors of the technology acceptance model that influence ChatGPT acceptance for active learning among undergraduates in Hong Kong.
Method
Using a structural equation modeling approach, we examined the extended technology acceptance model in the context of higher education. Using self-report questionnaires, we obtained useful responses from 473 undergraduate students in Hong Kong in July 2023. The reliability and validity of the data were measured using confirmatory factor analysis, followed by path analysis to investigate the hypotheses in the proposed model.
Results
We identified intrinsic motivation as the strongest motivator for ChatGPT use intention. Consistent with the prior literature on technology acceptance, perceived usefulness was found to be a strong predictor of behavioral intention. In contrast to extant research, the findings indicate no significant relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. Neither perceived usefulness nor perceived ease of use were significant mediators in the relationship between intrinsic motivation and behavioral intention.
Conclusion
These findings highlight the significant effect of intrinsic motivation on ChatGPT acceptance in supporting students’ active learning. They also provide inspiration for ChatGPT developers and educationalists regarding the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (perceived usefulness) in promoting the broader acceptance of chatbots in the educational context. Efforts should be made to improve students’ positive subjective experiences and the response quality of ChatGPT."
PUJIASTUTI20241738,The Effectiveness of Using Augmented Reality on the Geometry Thinking Ability of Junior High School Students,"This study aimed to test the effectiveness of using augmented reality applications in learning geometry in junior high school students. The method used in this study is the quasi-experiment method. In this study, researchers used learning with augmented reality to find its effect on student learning outcomes in grade 8 junior high school, which has an average age of 13 years. The research design used in this study was a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group design. This study, 2 sample classes were taken: an experimental class (learning with augmented reality) and a control class (learning without augmented reality). The experimental and control classes have the same characteristics; each has 20 male and 20 female students. The instrument used in this research is a geometric thinking ability test. This study uses a test instrument in the form of essay questions. The instrument was given twice, namely during the pretest and post-test. There are ten essay questions made. After obtaining the data from the pretest and post-test results, the normalized gain score formula (N-Gain) was used to know the increase in geometric thinking skills. The N-Gain result of the experimental class is 78% or 0.78, which is in the high category. Whereas in the control class, it was 50% or 0.58, this result is in the moderate category. The N-gain results show that there is a difference between the experimental class and the control class. In this case, the effectiveness of using augmented reality for learning geometry in junior high school students is higher than those who did not receive augmented reality treatment. From the N-gain value, it proves that learning using augmented reality learning media is effective in increasing the ability to think Geometry. Then the results of observations made during learning activities using augmented reality show that students look active and make students more enthusiastic when learning Geometry. The results of the responses showed that 39 students had become more proactive in learning Geometry by using augmented reality applications."
FLYNN2021100325,A narrative review of methods used to examine digital gaming impacts on learning and cognition during middle childhood,"Middle childhood remains a privileged albeit understudied developmental period in studies examining child–computer interactions, particularly as it pertains to digital game play. Middle childhood also is marked by increasing digital game play, arguably the most common form of child–computer interactions during this developmental period. For example, children between the ages of 6 and 8 play digital games 60–90 min per day and 47% of 3rd to 8th grade teachers reported using digital games in their classrooms several times a week (Vega & Robb, 2019). Surprisingly, how content learning and cognition may be facilitated through digital gaming remains sparsely investigated among children during this period. In the studies that do examine the linkages between game play and content learning or cognition, research methodologies vary markedly. The goal of this narrative review is to help bring greater cohesion to the research literature, which often spans many disciplines. This review emphasizes the games, measurement of outcomes, and research designs that have been used to examine content learning and cognitive skills among children ages 6 to 12 in the context of digital games."
ZHAO2021104212,Digital competence in higher education research: A systematic literature review,"In the information and knowledge society, where technology develops rapidly and penetrates deeply into our lives, the discussion about digital competence has become a hot topic today. After the emergence of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) and with its huge impact on the education industry, the concern about digital competence has reached a new height. This systematic literature review uses Web of science and Scopus as databases to store and analyze the existing research on digital competence in higher education settings. The purpose of this review is to provide the scholar community with a current overview of digital competence research from 2015 to 2021 in the context of higher education regarding the definition of digital competence, dimensions used to evaluate digital competence, research purposes, methodologies, and results and limitations. Major findings include that the majority of publications cited both research and EU policy in describing the definition of digital competence. The review indicates that most university students and teachers have a basic level of digital competence. Besides, the institutions of higher education are encouraged to focus on the development students and teachers’ digital competence, create relevant learning strategies and use appropriate tools to improve the quality of education."
KOPONEN202557,Sales managers' perceptions of interpersonal communication competence in leading AI-integrated sales teams,"Adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer the issue for most professional organizations—the question is how to integrate it into the functions and organizational processes. Considering the current integration of AI in work processes, the requirements for sales managers' interpersonal communication competence (ICC) are likely to be modified. However, research on sales management competencies is surprisingly scarce. This longitudinal case study investigates sales managers' perceptions of their ICC needs in leading AI-integrated sales teams in the financial sector. During the years 2019–2024, 35 expert interviews with sales managers were collected from one of Scandinavia's largest financial groups. The findings indicate that AI system integration brought benefits, concerns and communication challenges to sales managers' job content. The main components related to sales managers' ICC in leading AI-integrated sales teams encompass both traditional competencies (motivation, knowledge, communication skills, and adaptability) but also include contextual AI factors and a concern for ethical reflectivity. A component model of managerial interpersonal communication competence in AI-integrated teams (MICCAIT) is produced and its implications are examined. Given the greater reliance on technology, sales managers may increasingly need to place greater emphasis on their empathy and people-oriented skills for the human employees remaining in the workplace."
MAHER2025205,Reactive transport as a scientific framework,"Reactive transport is a framework that integrates across disciplines and scales, and leverages cutting-edge computational techniques to advance a nuanced understanding of Earth's complex systems. As a way of thinking, it connects science, engineering, and natural systems, and unifies across experiment, field and modeling studies. This chapter links core reactive transport concepts to their mathematical constructs embodied in reactive transport models. Approaches for scaling, such as dimensionless numbers, enable translation from conceptual to numerical models. The increasing complexity of numerical models also requires both targeted measurements and tools for evaluating and learning from multifaceted numerical models, emphasizing the importance of implementing reactive transport frameworks early in the design of any scientific study."
ROMEROORGANVIDEZ2024112150,UVLHub: A feature model data repository using UVL and open science principles,"Feature models are the de facto standard for modelling variabilities and commonalities in features and relationships in software product lines. They are the base artefacts in many engineering activities, such as product configuration, derivation, or testing. Concrete models in different domains exist; however, many are in private or sparse repositories or belong to discontinued projects. The dispersion of knowledge of feature models hinders the study and reuse of these artefacts in different studies. The Universal Variability Language (UVL) is a community effort textual feature model language that promotes a common way of serializing feature models independently of concrete tools. Open science principles promote transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research. Although some attempts exist to promote feature model sharing, the existing solutions lack open science principles by design. In addition, existing and public feature models are described using formats not always supported by current tools. This paper presents , a repository of feature models in UVL format. provides a front end that facilitates the search, upload, storage, and management of feature model datasets, improving the capabilities of discontinued proposals. Furthermore, the tool communicates with Zenodo – one of the most well-known open science repositories – providing a permanent save of datasets and following open science principles. includes existing datasets and is readily available to include new data and functionalities in the future. It is maintained by three active universities in variability modelling."
DEJONG2023100536,Let's talk evidence – The case for combining inquiry-based and direct instruction,"Many studies investigating inquiry learning in science domains have appeared over the years. Throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. In this vein, Zhang, Kirschner, Cobern, and Sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. In the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. We review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. We show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. We subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students' prior knowledge and other student characteristics. Furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. Therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. We conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students’ investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures."
MAHOWALD2024517,Dissociating language and thought in large language models,"Large language models (LLMs) have come closest among all models to date to mastering human language, yet opinions about their linguistic and cognitive capabilities remain split. Here, we evaluate LLMs using a distinction between formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic rules and patterns) and functional linguistic competence (understanding and using language in the world). We ground this distinction in human neuroscience, which has shown that formal and functional competence rely on different neural mechanisms. Although LLMs are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance on functional competence tasks remains spotty and often requires specialized fine-tuning and/or coupling with external modules. We posit that models that use language in human-like ways would need to master both of these competence types, which, in turn, could require the emergence of separate mechanisms specialized for formal versus functional linguistic competence."
DAH20239,Facilitation of Student Questioning in the Malaysian Secondary Science Classroom Using the Investigable Questioning Formulation Technique (IQFT) Protocol,"This study developed the Investigable Questioning Formulation Technique (IQFT) protocol to formulate investigable questions by following the procedures of design-based research. As guiding heuristics, the protocol used two provisional design principles based on teaching experience and previous studies that have applied tools for formulating questions, notably, the question formulation technique, SMART goals, and a typology of investigable and non-investigable questions. Two cycles comprising six lesson interventions were completed with two groups (n = 23, n = 25) of students in the same school in Malaysia. Questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and a question typology framework. Findings show the majority of students formulated comparison, exploratory, and validation of mental model questions. Some questions were posed in the prediction, descriptive, and problem-solving categories, but none were categorized as cause and effect, design and make, or pattern seeking. Implications for use of the IQFT protocol to help facilitate Malaysian students’ generation of investigable questions, design experiments, and implement open inquiry are discussed."
ARASTOOPOURIRGENS2023103952,Analyzing a teacher and researcher co-design partnership through the lens of communities of practice,"Research-Practice Partnerships (RPP) bridge the gap between schools and universities. However, few have embraced the co-design process through a communities of practice lens and investigated how knowledge is co-constructed and negotiated. This mixed-method study explored how elementary school teachers co-construct knowledge with researchers to understand better how a community of practice can be cultivated during a co-design RPP. Findings from a survey, journal entries, observational field notes, and focus groups suggest teachers co-constructed knowledge while acknowledging and mitigating conflicts. Based on these findings, we offer ways to seed and cultivate communities of practice among teachers and researchers for co-designing educational innovations."
CORKIN2022104642,Are distinct modes of using digital technologies evident by age eight? Implications for digital divides.,"Digital divides occur when there are inequities in access to the benefits afforded by digital technologies. Originally conceptualised as inequitable access to digital technologies and internet, it is now recognised that the ways in which individuals use digital technologies and the competencies they subsequently develop may also contribute to digital divides. The aims of the current study were twofold. Firstly, to investigate categories of screen media use outside of school for children at age eight, and whether children of this age fall into “user typographies”, whereby different “modes” of digital technology use have already started to emerge. Secondly, to consider the implications of different modes of use at 8 years of age for the establishment of digital divides. Using a sample of 5010 children participating in the Growing Up in New Zealand study, the results of factor analysis indicated six categories of screen-based activities (Social, Creative, Shopping, Educational, Entertainment, and Interests), while four different modes of digital technology use were identified via cluster analysis (Creative, Entertainment, Emergent, and Limited). While Entertainment Users and Creative Users engaged with most activities on a fairly regularly basis, Emergent Users, and in particular, Limited Users, engaged with a narrower range of activities and at lower frequencies. We argue that Entertainment Users and Creative Users who engage with a broader range of activities, and engage in Creative activities such as coding and programming outside of school, may be at an advantage with regard to digital divides. Possible strategies to help mitigate digital divides are proposed."

MAULANA2025100413,"Artificial Intelligence, Job Seeker, and Career Trajectory: How AI-Based Learning Experiences Affect the Commitment of Fresh Graduates to be an Accountant?","Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the accounting professions is reshaping traditional roles and skill requirements, prompting a reassessment of how graduates are prepared for these changes. However, a significant gap exists in understanding how AI-based learning in higher education curricula influences graduates' readiness and commitment to be accountants. Addressing this gap, this study aims to answer two pivotal questions: how do AI learning experiences affect AI self-efficacy and career commitment, and how do literacy, motivations, and competency factors mediate this relationship? This study grounds in Self-determination Theory (SDT) and Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to answer the questions and utilizes a multiple mediation model with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze survey data gathered from 698 fresh graduates in accounting and finance program across the country (Indonesia). The finding confirms that AI-based learning experiences in higher education influence fresh graduates’ AI self-efficacy and career commitment through the mediating role of AI literacy, competency, and motivations. This study demonstrates that AI-based learning enhances students' literacy and competencies in AI/accounting software while boosting intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to master AI skills for future career benefits. Ultimately, increased motivation, literacy, and competencies strengthen graduates' self-efficacy and confidence, supporting their commitment to a career in accounting. This study, therefore, contributes a novel insight by providing empirical considerations for higher education and the accounting industry to strengthen AI-based curricula for future workforce supply."
WANG2023100364,Evaluate the drivers for digital transformation in higher education institutions in the era of industry 4.0 based on decision-making method,"The digitalization of higher education (HE) institutions and relevant issues have attracted the attention of many educational stakeholders. ICT has become a subject of high importance in every context, particularly in the workplace; thus, a principal goal for universities and schools is to prepare future professionals capable of dealing with problems and searching for effective solutions by their digital competence as a key skill. In this regard, a new framework is developed to evaluate the main drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions (HEIs) in the era of industry 4.0. The developed framework is proposed a decision approach that can effectively use the presented information to make decisions of high rationality. This framework is applied to compute the subjective and objective criteria weights, and it is used to assess the preferences of organizations. An empirical case study to evaluate the main drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs is taken. According to the findings, the most significant drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0 are developing, updating, and adapting a curriculum (0.0425), integration of digital technologies for universal education (0.0420), and cloud computing (0.0419), respectively. Hence, the evaluation results also show that the option higher education institution (HEI)-4 has the highest overall utility degree (1.845) over different drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in HEIs in the era of Industry 4.0. Also, comparison and sensitivity investigation are made to show the superiority of the developed framework."

PARK2022149,The Development of a STEAM Program about Global Energy with a Focus on Democratic Citizenship,"This study explored democratic citizenship (DC) for students by developing a DC framework (DCF) with eight components. We employed the DCF to examine what and how much DC was included in Korean science textbooks and lab books focused on the topic of energy for Grades K–12. We found different DC components were included at different grade levels and some components were not present at all. To help address the uneven distribution of these components, we developed four DC inclusive science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) books related to the topic of energy. These books were designed with the DCF to foster rich DC learning experiences in school science. We engaged 13 teachers as consultants in a validation process when developing the DC inclusive STEAM books. This study describes the development and implementation of the DCF for preparing supplemental science curriculum materials that can improve students’ appreciation for DC.

WILKIE2024101121,Primary students’ relational thinking and computation strategies with concrete-to-symbolic representations of subtraction as difference,"Children are highly inclined to attend to the properties of numbers, operations and equality when given helpful tools for doing so. Our aim was to investigate early algebraic thinking with the compensation property of equality for subtraction. We provided 22 (9–11-year-old) students with physical blocks for building vertical towers and conducted individual interviews with them as they completed a sequence of 15 tasks involving subtraction as difference using concrete, numeric, and symbolic representations. Relational thinking was evidenced across a range of subtraction calculation skill levels. Those students who could use both indirect addition and take-away strategies flexibly, depending on the size of the numbers involved, were more likely to evidence attention to generality with symbolic equations. The shift to symbolic equations elicited some students’ productive attempts to connect subtraction as difference and subtraction as take way but seemed to hinder others by provoking a return to take away calculations rather than relational thinking strategies."
MORINA2025105247,"Effects of online teacher professional development on teacher-, classroom-, and student-level outcomes: A meta-analysis","Teachers' professional development is crucial for effective classroom practice. Due to its advantages, many teachers have participated in online professional development (OPD) in recent years. Numerous studies have investigated the participation and effect of first to 12th grade in-service teachers' OPD participation on the teacher, classroom practice, or student level. However, a comprehensive meta-analysis of these studies is missing. This meta-analysis summarizes findings from 102 quantitative studies with a pre-posttest design. The results indicate medium effects of OPD participation on the teacher level (Hedges' g = 0.71) and on the classroom level (Hedges' g = 0.55) and a small effect on the student level (Hedges' g = 0.19). We included Desimones' (2009) core features of effective PD participation as moderators. We found that the core feature of collective participation positively influenced the effect size of the classroom level. Furthermore, we found that studies that employed a control-group design reported significantly lower effect sizes on teacher-level outcomes than studies that used a within-subject design. On the student's level, studies with asynchronous OPD reported significantly smaller effect sizes than studies with a synchronous OPD format. Our results aim to provide research, policymakers, educational stakeholders, and teachers with the clarity that OPD is effective on several levels and should, therefore, be encouraged."
PARK2024102705,"AI vs. human-generated content and accounts on Instagram: User preferences, evaluations, and ethical considerations","As content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) has become more accessible and higher quality, social debates have intensified. Therefore, this study investigates how people perceive and evaluate AI-generated content and accounts compared to human-created accounts and content. We created Instagram accounts representing AI, influencers, and the public and conducted a user study with 43 participants. The participants had difficulty distinguishing AI accounts from human ones. Moreover, there were significant differences in user perceptions concerning the three account types. Participants perceived the AI and influencer accounts as more attractive than the public account, and they rated the quality of AI-generated content as highly as that created by influencers. These findings suggest that the advancement of generative AI could alter the social media landscape and contribute to discussions on the characteristics and ethical problems of AI-generated content."
TSAI2023104849,The effects of online peer-facilitated learning and distributed pair programming on students’ learning,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced universities and schools around the world to adopt online learning. Teachers may wonder if their students can attain satisfactory learning performance in an online learning environment without teachers' on-the-spot attention. In order to develop students' skills in programming, promote their enjoyment of learning and intention to learn to program, the researchers integrated two innovative teaching approaches, using online peer-facilitated learning and distributed pair programming, and investigated the effects of these on students' online learning performance. This study conducted an experiment that included 128 undergraduates from four class sections of Department of Finance. Thus, the experimental design in this research was a 2 (Peer-facilitated learning vs. non-peer-facilitated learning) × 2 (Distributed pair programming vs. non-distributed pair programming) factorial pretest/post-test design. The participants in this research mainly consisted of four classes of students from a non-computer or information department who took a compulsory course on programming design.’ Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in this study. According to the results, the peer-facilitated learning group exhibited significantly better development of programming skills, enjoyment of learning, and intention to learn, than the non-peer-facilitated learning group. However, expected effects of enhancing the learning of the students in this study who received the distributed pair programming were not found. The design of online pedagogy can be a reference for online educators. The implications of applying online peer-facilitated learning and distributed pair programming to support students’ learning and the design of online programming courses are discussed."
GONZALEZHOWARD2024102356,An examination of student epistemic agency: Students’ perspectives on and experiences with argumentation during STEM design challenges,"Science and engineering practices (SEPs) can help students make sense of, and engage with, the natural and designed world. Though using SEPs can support student epistemic agency, this is compromised when students do not perceive SEPs as meaningful to sensemaking. This study explores the relationship between students’ perspectives of the SEP of argumentation, and the epistemic agency they exhibit. Three themes emerged pertaining how students’ understandings of the design tasks’ participation framework and greater applications impacted their epistemic agency. Findings suggest the importance of making explicit to students the rationales behind new student expectations to prevent “pseudo-student epistemic agency,” and shed light on the significance of fostering equitable classroom communities where all members are viewed as valuable and capable sensemakers."
TAN2020194429,Inferring biosynthetic and gene regulatory networks from Artemisia annua RNA sequencing data on a credit card-sized ARM computer,"Prediction of gene function and gene regulatory networks is one of the most active topics in bioinformatics. The accumulation of publicly available gene expression data for hundreds of plant species, together with advances in bioinformatical methods and affordable computing, sets ingenuity as one of the major bottlenecks in understanding gene function and regulation. Here, we show how a credit card-sized computer retailing for <50 USD can be used to rapidly predict gene function and infer regulatory networks from RNA sequencing data. To achieve this, we constructed a bioinformatical pipeline that downloads and allows quality-control of RNA sequencing data; and generates a gene co-expression network that can reveal enzymes and transcription factors participating and controlling a given biosynthetic pathway. We exemplify this by first identifying genes and transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of secondary cell wall in the plant Artemisia annua, the main natural source of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Networks were then used to dissect the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway, which suggest potential transcription factors regulating artemisinin biosynthesis. We provide the source code of our pipeline (https://github.com/mutwil/LSTrAP-Lite) and envision that the ubiquity of affordable computing, availability of biological data and increased bioinformatical training of biologists will transform the field of bioinformatics. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Transcriptional Profiles and Regulatory Gene Networks edited by Dr. Dr. Federico Manuel Giorgi and Dr. Shaun Mahony."
BERMUDEZ2023205,Designing culturally situated playful environments for early STEM learning with a Latine community,"Children from underserved, minoritized, and immigrant families have less access to early out-of-school STEM learning opportunities. Playful Learning Landscapes increase the accessibility of early STEM learning in everyday public spaces (e.g., bus stops, grocery stores) by merging principles of guided play and STEM learning goals with local community's values. We used community-based design research to (1) identify Latine families’ funds of knowledge related to play, science, and math learning, and (2) create designs for playful environments merging families’ values and practices with guided play and STEM learning principles. Our design partners were 32 parents, primarily Spanish-speaking immigrant mothers from Mexico, and two directors of a local community organization. The design process consisted of co-design sessions, interviews, inductive thematic analysis, elaboration, playtest and feedback, and iteration. Our findings showed that familismo, heritage representation, and the meaning of community spaces influenced the ways families engaged in STEM learning and the learning environments they desired in their community. Moreover, families’ STEM practices were rooted in everyday experiences of playing cultural games, family food routines, and outdoor activities. Incorporating Latine parents in the design process and leveraging their funds of knowledge resulted in culturally situated designs aligned with playful and STEM learning principles. This study contributes to knowledge of Latine families’ values and practices that can help create home-community connections to strengthen children's learning."
SU2023100124,Artificial Intelligence (AI) Literacy in Early Childhood Education: The Challenges and Opportunities,"Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy has become an emerging topic in digital literacy education research. However, it is still under-explored in early childhood education (ECE) since the AI curriculum for young children has just been designed in recent years. A scoping review was conducted to examine the thematic and content analysis of 16 empirical papers from 2016 to 2022. This scoping reviews evaluate, synthesize, and display 16 studies on AI literacy in early childhood education, including curriculum design, AI tools, pedagogical approaches, research designs, assessment methods, and findings. The discussion of the AI literacy implementation in ECE contributes to providing references for educators and researchers to design interventions to engage young children in AI learning. Further, we identified a set of challenges and opportunities of AI literacy. Several challenges included (1) lack of teachers' AI knowledge, skills, and confidence; (2) lack of curriculum design; and (3) lack of teaching guidelines. Although educators meet challenges at the beginning stage of developing AI instructional design for young children, AI learning could bring learning opportunities and foster young children's AI literacy in terms of AI concepts, practices and perspectives. We foresee that there will be a growing number of age-appropriate curriculum and tools for the ECE level. At the end, we also make some recommendations for future researchers and educators to improve AI literacy research and learning design in early childhood education."
FAN2024104700,"Micro-credentialing as an approach to educator professional learning: Voices from developers, pursuers, and assessors","This study investigated the quality, benefits, and challenges of a micro-credentialing program implemented in one state in the United States. A mixed-methods design was used, and data was collected through two surveys with 147 educators and interviews with 24 educators. The micro-credentialing program was beneficial for educators' professional growth, and developers/assessors reported more perceived benefits than pursuers. Pursuers' satisfaction, motives to participate, experience with the micro-credentialing program, and race/ethnicity significantly predicted their perceived benefits. Challenges were related to platform, time, resources, awareness, and micro mindset. The findings can inform the development and implementation of professional learning programs and policymaking."
RAMOSVEGA2021100405,Stimulating children’s engagement with an educational serious videogame using Lean UX co-design,"The motivation to stimulate children’s learning engagement could be found in the fact that learning is not always motivational in itself. This is particularly true when learning is obligatory and based upon material that has not been chosen by the children themselves. A Lean UX approach to the co-design of an educational serious videogame (MOBI) is proposed in this paper. The core idea is that children's natural interest in playing can be stimulated by engendering the feeling that they are participating in the creation of something. The hypothesis is that this approach can increase the children's level of engagement and can facilitate their awareness of their learning perception. With the aim of testing this hypothesis, this paper describes an experience with 50 children with ages between 10 and 12 years old. The results indicate that the children’s satisfaction grew significantly during the process, with an important reduction in the requests for changes and that 60% had the perception of having learned. It can be concluded that the co-design based upon a Lean UX methodology, of a children’s educational serious videogame increases their level of product engagement and facilitates their awareness of their learning perception."
ZHENG2020103669,Profiling self-regulation behaviors in STEM learning of engineering design,"Engineering design is a complex process which requires science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) knowledge. Students' self-regulation plays a critical role in interdisciplinary tasks. However, there is limited research investigating whether and how self-regulation leads to different learning outcomes among students in engineering design. This study analyzes the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade U.S. students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. It classifies the students into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. Competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform best in the task. Cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. In contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. Minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. The results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort. The results also offer new insights into STEM education and self-regulated learning with emerging learning analytics."
GARDNER202477,Chapter 4 - Smart design for urban activation and placemaking,"This chapter charts out the distinction between the concepts of digital placemaking and smart placemaking. It examines existing and speculative urban technology projects that combine spatial design thinking and physical computing to address placemaking design goals such as urban activation, amenitization, and safety and security. In ways different from conventional smart city initiatives that surveil urban dynamics en masse to imperceptibly calibrate large-scale urban services and infrastructural systems, the projects discussed in this chapter engage sensor-based technologies to create localized, responsive, and interactive urban environments to address the social, cultural, and aesthetic dimensions of urban livability."
RADIANTI2020103778,"A systematic review of immersive virtual reality applications for higher education: Design elements, lessons learned, and research agenda","Researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (VR) in different scenarios. VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field."
XU2022101985,FaNDS: Fake News Detection System using energy flow,"Recently, the term “fake news” has been broadly and extensively utilized for disinformation, misinformation, hoaxes, propaganda, satire, rumors, click-bait, and junk news. It has become a serious problem around the world. We present a new system, FaNDS, that detects fake news efficiently. The system is based on several concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. There are two main concepts: an Inconsistency Graph and Energy Flow. The Inconsistency Graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions between them for edges. Energy Flow assigns each node an initial energy and then some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on all nodes converges. To illustrate FaNDS we use the original data from the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1). First, the data has to be reconstructed in order to generate the Inconsistency Graph. The graph contains various subgraphs with well-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the news items. Then the Energy Flow method is applied. The nodes with high energy are the candidates for being fake news. In our experiments, all these were indeed fake news as we checked each using several reliable web sites. We compared FaNDS to several other fake news detection methods and found it to be more sensitive in discovering fake news items."
XIE2020297,"The information impact of network media, the psychological reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, and online knowledge acquisition: Evidence from Chinese college students","This study focuses on whether network media information about the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the online knowledge acquisition of college students. This research is of great significance, as it can have a profound impact on the way we think about knowledge acquisition in the future. Yet, a recent literature review finds that the academic community has not paid attention to this important topic. In the present work, which is based on a survey of 5000 Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic period, we find that COVID-19 information from mainstream Chinese media and overseas media as well as social media has had a significant promoting effect on the online knowledge acquisition of college students. At the same time, the psychological response to the pandemic situation is shown to have had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between the information impact from mainstream Chinese and overseas media and the online knowledge acquisition of college students. Our findings have shown that the more positive college students are in responding to the pandemic, the stronger their willingness is to acquire knowledge through online means, and the better effect this will have on them acquiring knowledge. The results of this paper have important implications for the optimization and improvement of college students’ education and knowledge acquisition methods in the context of the long-term COVID-19 pandemic."
XIANG2023100583,Making a Makerspace for children: A mixed-methods study in Chinese kindergartens,"The purpose of this study was to investigate how the “Making a Makerspace” (MM) program can enhance children’s maker literacy and teachers’ understanding of maker education in makerspaces. The program was carried out in two kindergartens in China for three months and involved 407 children and 24 teachers. Six classrooms in each kindergarten were either assigned to the Makerspace condition or the control condition. Results from teacher questionnaires and observations of the children’s maker activities showed significant improvements in problem finding & solving, hands-on, creative design, and communication skills among the children in the Makerspace condition compared to the control condition. The study revealed that children in 4- and 5-year-old classes were proficient in using the Engineering Design Process in maker activities, but this was not the case for 3-year-old classes. The teachers also reported positive experiences with the MM program. This study highlights the effectiveness of makerspaces in early childhood education and provides a practical case for implementing makerspaces in kindergarten classrooms."
KUI202267,A survey of visual analytics techniques for online education,"Visual analytics techniques are widely utilized to facilitate the exploration of online educational data. To help researchers better understand the necessity and the efficiency of these techniques in online education, we systematically review related works of the past decade to provide a comprehensive view of the use of visualization in online education problems. We establish a taxonomy based on the analysis goal and classify the existing visual analytics techniques into four categories: learning behavior analysis, learning content analysis, analysis of interactions among students, and prediction and recommendation. The use of visual analytics techniques is summarized in each category to show their benefits in different analysis tasks. At last, we discuss the future research opportunities and challenges in the utilization of visual analytics techniques for online education."

WANG2023e20947,How problem difficulty and order influence programming education outcomes in online judge systems,"With the widespread application of computer technology in engineering education, Online Judge (OJ) systems have become an important platform for programming teaching. OJ systems provide a platform for learners to practice programming skills, submit solutions, and receive feedback. They offer a conducive environment for learners to engage in hands-on coding exercises and enhance their programming abilities. This article explores the use of OJ systems as a software tool for enhancing programming education in engineering. It investigates how the difficulty and order of programming problems affect the users' behavior, performance, and cognitive load in OJ environments. The research data were sourced from Project_CodeNet. Using statistical methods, such as Spearman correlation analysis and differential analysis, the study reveals the factors that influence the users' submission situations, answer order, and learning outcomes. The findings provide useful implications for OJ system developers, teachers, and learners in designing, implementing, and using OJ systems for programming education in engineering. The study suggests that problem difficulty and order should be considered and adjusted according to the users' abilities and progress, to provide appropriate challenges and support, balance the cognitive load, and improve the programming skills of the users."
AN2025105227,Impacts of generative AI on student teachers' task performance and collaborative knowledge construction process in mind mapping-based collaborative environment,"Collaboration has long been recognized as an efficacious pedagogical strategy. With the visual pedagogical scaffold, for instance, mind maps, learners can externalize their comprehension and engage in meaning negotiation. However, given the limitations posed by the conventional collaborative environment such as the difficulty for groups to achieve deep discussions and generate group intelligence, the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tool was introduced. The efficacy of the GAI tool in boosting task performance is still contested and its influence on collaborative knowledge construction remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted in an elective course at a university. A total of 30 student teachers were the participants, including 10 groups of 3 students. In the subsequent quasi-experimental study, 5 experimental groups employed the GAI tool and mind mapping based collaborative environment (GMMCE) and 5 control groups employed the conventional mind mapping based collaborative environment (MMCE). The results showed that the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on both collaborative tasks in the course. According to Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), the experimental groups developed a collaborative knowledge construction process in cognitive dimension, i.e., progressive interaction from individual to peer to group. On the contrary, the control groups were mainly reflected in the transition between learners' individual expression and peer interaction since they were more centered on the regulative dimension. We also supplemented students’ perception of using the GAI tool from the interview data. Finally, we highlighted the implications for pedagogy and described the research limitations as well as future directions."
MACIASMACIAS2023106909,Interpretation of a deep analysis of speech imagery features extracted by a capsule neural network,"Speech imagery has been successfully employed in developing Brain–Computer Interfaces because it is a novel mental strategy that generates brain activity more intuitively than evoked potentials or motor imagery. There are many methods to analyze speech imagery signals, but those based on deep neural networks achieve the best results. However, more research is necessary to understand the properties and features that describe imagined phonemes and words. In this paper, we analyze the statistical properties of speech imagery EEG signals from the KaraOne dataset to design a method that classifies imagined phonemes and words. With this analysis, we propose a Capsule Neural Network that categorizes speech imagery patterns into bilabial, nasal, consonant-vocal, and vowels/iy/ and/uw/. The method is called Capsules for Speech Imagery Analysis (CapsK-SI). The input of CapsK-SI is a set of statistical features of EEG speech imagery signals. The architecture of the Capsule Neural Network is composed of a convolution layer, a primary capsule layer, and a class capsule layer. The average accuracy reached is 90.88%±7 for bilabial, 90.15%±8 for nasal, 94.02%±6 for consonant–vowel, 89.70%±8 for word-phoneme, 94.33%± for/iy/ vowel and, 94.21%±3 for/uw/ vowel detection. Finally, with the activity vectors of the CapsK-SI capsules, we generated brain maps to represent brain activity in the production of bilabial, nasal, and consonant-vocal signals."
LAVI2021101002,Perceptions of STEM alumni and students on developing 21st century skills through methods of teaching and learning,"21st century skills are essential for career readiness. We investigated the development of students’ 21st century skills at a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research university: Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. We designed a self-reporting questionnaire covering 14 skills and deployed it to approximately 1500 students and alumni. Respondents were asked to rate each skill based on the degree to which it was developed during their studies. Domain-general skills scored higher than STEM-specific skills or soft (interpersonal) skills, whereas STEM-specific skills scored higher than soft skills. Content analysis revealed nine methods of teaching and learning through which skills developed. The four active methods had a small effect on domain-general skills, while the five passive methods had a medium-to-large effect on these skills. Active methods had a medium-size effect on both STEM-specific and soft skills, whereas passive methods had no effect on either group. Our contribution lies in identifying and matching methods to skills."

This study describes the 3-year design-based research project to develop, implement, test and redesign teacher facing and student facing materials across 21 classrooms, that use a Project-based Learning context to support the development of the NGSS. After three cycles of implementation, evaluation and revision, the Multiple Literacies in Project-based Learning curriculum demonstrated how authentic, rigorous and supported contexts for teachers can foster upper elementary students' development of all three dimensional of the NGSS through the PBL features of meaningful driving questions, collaboration, focus on learning goals, and physical artifacts."
MARX2023100169,Secondary school students' mental models and attitudes regarding artificial intelligence - A scoping review,"With the increasing relevance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in society, AI literacy is increasingly being integrated into K-12 education. However, students already form conceptions about modern technologies (especially AI) from their interaction with their everyday environment. In this paper, we conduct a systematic scoping review on the emerging research field of secondary school students' mental models and attitudes regarding AI. Our goal is to identify research approaches and uncover research gaps. To achieve this, we reviewed literature published within the timeframe of 2012–2022 found in the ACM, IEEE, ERIC, and Science Direct databases. In total, we identified 18 relevant papers, for which we collected and evaluated research objectives, approaches, results, and areas requiring further investigation. Our findings reveal that most of the literature examined focuses with students' attitudes toward AI and moderating variables. Additionally, there is preliminary research on the types of mental models students possess about AI. Notable research gaps include the absence of development of research instruments for surveying mental models and insufficient research into the impact of learning interventions on the construction of students' mental models."
ETUKAKPAN2023100234,Transforming pharmaceutical education: A needs-based global analysis for policy development,"Background
A needs-based approach is desirable for the transformation of pharmaceutical education, and to link pharmaceutical education with the health needs of populations and national priorities. There are varying levels of data in the literature on the status of pharmaceutical education in all six World Health Organization (WHO) regions, especially in the context of needs identification and evidence-based policy interventions. The framework for this study was the FIP Development Goals.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to develop evidence-based policies through a needs-based approach for pharmaceutical education transformation nationally, regionally and globally by addressing the following objectives: 1. Identify global and regional needs in pharmaceutical education, through a regional SWOT analysis and prioritization of FIP development goals; 2. Develop valid and credible regional roadmaps for pharmaceutical education advancement according to the identified prioritized goals and 3. Develop a global call to action as a policy intervention for advancing pharmaceutical education.
Methods
This study was conducted between 2020 and 2021 using a mixed methods approach. Surveys of higher education institutions and a series of qualitative interviews were conducted with national professional leadership organizations, with further regional workshops having 284 participants recruited from the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) membership base, spanning all six WHO regions.
Results
Eleven out of 21 FIP DGs were identified as priorities for regional roadmaps and FIP DG 1 (Academic capacity) was identified as a priority in four regions. All regions had distinctive results with an area of commonality between them. There were common weaknesses in the adoption of competency-based education and inter-professional education.
Conclusions
It is critical for every country and region to develop needs- and evidence-based policies for the transformation of pharmaceutical education, for which FIP DGs provide a systematic framework."
LIU2023101335,Promoting design thinking and creativity by making: A quasi-experiment in the information technology course,"Design thinking and creativity are instrumental elements of 21st century skills. In K-12 education, much is left to be known about how to develop curricula to more effectively foster students’ design and creative thinking. This study introduced maker education to the information technology course to investigate the effects of design-oriented making on students’ learning of programming, creativity, and design thinking. Seventy-two fifth-grade students from two classes at a rural primary school in China participated in this eight-week study. Both classes learned about programming a digital greeting card with Mind+, when the experimental group was taught with a design-oriented making pedagogy, whereas the control group learned through a conventional teaching approach. Questionnaires were used to assess students’ knowledge learning, creativity and design thinking competence. Findings showed that when embedded in an open-ended problem-solving context, integrating design thinking into making as a pedagogy can be conducive to the development of design thinking and creativity. Important implications are made to inform future endeavors in fostering student thinking in maker education."
THOMA2023104210,Teaching STEAM through universal design for learning in early years of primary education: Plugged-in and unplugged activities with emphasis on connectivism learning theory.,"This paper presents four teachers’ design and implementation of an international eTwinning project within the Universal Design Learning (UDL) framework and the pedagogical theory of connectivism, aiming to provide meaningful access to STEAM education for pupils with diverse learning needs by introducing them to key competences for lifelong learning. The results of the qualitative content analysis reveal the advantages of this effort, including the improvement of the learning process, learners' active participation, and self-reflection through student-based assessment, teachers' professional development, but also considerations regarding planning and specifying activities, class schedules, course load, and the creation of self- or peer-assessment rubrics."
HA2024102682,Developing a conceptual framework for digital platform literacy,"This paper introduces the innovative concept of platform literacy, specifically within the context of digital platforms. In today's digital economy, where digital platforms are essential tools in people's lives and form the core of the digital ecosystem, the ability to effectively utilize these platforms is becoming crucial. This study systematically examines the existing literature on digital platforms and digital literacy to establish a conceptual foundation for assessing an individual's platform literacy. Drawing upon insights from the digital literacy framework, we propose a platform literacy framework that can be applied in practical settings. Methodologically, we conducted an extensive review of 735 research papers on digital literacies to gather definitions and frameworks. As a result, we identified seven core constructs and three main proficiencies that constitute the platform literacy framework. Moreover, to adapt the framework to the various digital platform contexts, we categorized it into fixed and variable attributes. This paper contributes to the growing body of knowledge on digital literacy by offering a comprehensive framework for understanding platform literacy within the digital platform landscape."
BELGRAVE2022101451,Using a participatory design approach for co-creating culturally situated STEM enrichment activities,"Researchers can use a participatory design approach to produce sustainable interventions that leverage the cultural values and practices of ethnoculturally and linguistically diverse populations. PD is underutilized in developmental psychology, but can be a powerful tool for creating culturally situated interventions that bridge gaps in research applicability, inclusivity, and effectiveness. We provide our design narrative for creating grocery store signage promoting early STEM learning in a predominantly low-income, Latine community. We conducted two design sessions with our research team and community members (n = 20) to learn about their past and present intergenerational grocery-shopping experiences and integrated their values into signage. This paper outlines the PD process we undertook and its implications for the field of developmental psychology. We argue that developmental psychologists would benefit from adopting PD as a methodology to build on diverse populations' strengths. This approach can produce relevant interventions that support children's learning in various community settings."
CAVALLO2022625,Chapter 18 - Metabolomics in public health,"The Chapter aims to propose a conceptual framework of Metabolomics in Public Health. As Metabolomics, between the many post-genomic study methods, has a true horizontal approach, because it studies the universe of the small molecules, it unravels signals which are downstream from genes, and much more near to the phenotype phenomena of a disease or condition. To address these concepts, a number of themes are discussed, namely the data integration at different levels, the relationship of Metabolomics with the Systems Biology Public Health Science, the relevance and role of longitudinal and lifelong studies, the role of the quantitative methods, the connection with Big Data in Public Health with the possible evolution towards a “precision public health” and, finally, the process of knowledge integration in the fields of policies, training and resources, with the final goal of a strong translation of Metabolomic tools from research to practice."
ROUMEN2021100277,Envisioning Arduino Action: A collaborative tool for physical computing in educational settings,"Micro-controllers like Arduino are increasingly used in classroom settings to teach skills, attitudes and knowledge around technology. Education around these tools is often set in group contexts and collaboration is typically considered an important part of the learning process. However, much of the software tools currently available are still designed around a laptop programming paradigm that tends to restrict collaboration rather than encourage shifting of roles and sharing of experiences. This paper explores how to design tools that invite collaborative interactions, in particular how mobile software tools, with heavy usage of video as an interactive resource, could allow for collaborative sketching and understanding. Based on contextual inquiries with educators, observations and engagements with students in classroom settings, and a workshop with Arduino Education, this paper sketches out a vision for how the software tools used for learning physical computing can be re-designed to better work within the context of group work from the observations, for groups of students aged 14–16-years old."
LIN2023104762,A review of using multilevel modeling in e-learning research,"Improving e-learning involves various levels of supports. Accordingly, researchers usually adopt complex research designs with a multilevel structure or repeated measurements to capture a heuristic view of learners’ perceptions, comprehension, and behavior in e-learning settings. A total of 76 studies with Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) as a multilevel modeling technique in 13 major e-learning journals from January 2000 to September 2022, published in the Web of Science, were reviewed. We assessed the applications of the following key criteria: reasons for using HLM, data characteristics, sample characteristics, model characteristics, variables used in the research, software use, and main technology used in the research. The results revealed that two-level models and random-intercept models are mostly used in multilevel model building. Moreover, most e-learning studies included two-level random intercept models with “students” as sampling units of analysis in Level 1, and “cognitive learning” (i.e., examination score, learning achievement) as the dependent variable in Level 1. Based on our review results, we provide suggestions and potential applications of using multilevel modeling in e-learning studies."
BOCK2020100960,On the semantics for spreadsheets with sheet-defined functions,"We give an operational semantics for the evaluation of spreadsheets, including sheet-defined and built-in numeric functions in the Funcalc spreadsheet platform. The semantics allows for different implementations and we discuss sheet-defined functions implemented using both interpretation and run-time code generation. The semantics specifies the expected result of a computation, also considering non-deterministic functions, independently of an evaluation mechanism. It can be extended to include the cost of formula evaluation for a cost analysis e.g. for use in parallelization of computations. An interesting future direction is to investigate experimentally how close our semantics is to that of major spreadsheet implementations."
KOUTROMANOS2023100028,Augmented reality smart glasses use and acceptance: Α literature review,"The research interest in the use of augmented reality smart glasses (ARSGs) has increased dramatically in recent years as they are utilised in many fields such as medicine and industry, as well as everyday life. This study aims to review the empirical research activity concerning the acceptance of ARSGs in all applicable fields. In total, 21 studies published from 2015 to 2022 have been reviewed. Their relative field, theoretical framework, methodological design, and the factors that were found to affect the acceptance or use of ARSGs were recorded. It was found that the research focuses more on users acting as consumers of the glasses than on professionals (e.g., doctors, teachers, athletes) using them in a specific field. Also, the majority of the studies base their theoretical framework either entirely or in part on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Moreover, the research models of these studies extend TAM by using various additional variables, such as privacy risk and external influence. Methodologically speaking, most of the studies follow the quantitative approach, without giving the participants the opportunity to interact with the glasses. In addition, the factors which were found to influence the acceptance or use of the glasses are varied and can be categorised as utilitarian, social, personal, risk-related, and technological. This review adds value to the theory of technology acceptance. This is because it is one of the first to address the acceptance or use of ARSGs. Since there is no acceptance model for ARSGs, the findings of this review could lead researchers to propose models for accepting ARSGs in various fields, such as education."
ZHU2024101242,Solvi: A visual constraint modeling tool,"Discrete constraint problems surface often in everyday life. Teachers might group students with complex considerations and hospital administrators need to produce staff rosters. Constraint programming (CP) provides techniques to efficiently find solutions. However, there remains a key challenge: these techniques are still largely inaccessible because expressing constraint problems requires sophisticated programming and logic skills. In this work we contribute a language and tool that leverage knowledge of how non-experts conceptualize problems to facilitate the expression of constraint models. Additionally, we report the results of a study surveying the advantages and remaining challenges towards making CP accessible to the wider public."
PARK2025101119,Code suggestions and explanations in programming learning: Use of ChatGPT and performance,"This study investigates the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, in enhancing programming education for university students, specifically in big data analytics. The research addresses the growing need for innovative educational practices, especially in developed East Asian countries like South Korea, where declining university enrollment presents new challenges. Using a sample size of N = 343 students, this mixed-methods research employed controlled experiments and surveys to compare student performance in programming tasks across three groups: those using ChatGPT, those using Stack Overflow, and a control group without external assistance. Results showed that students using ChatGPT significantly outperformed those relying on Stack Overflow or no assistance, particularly in hands-on coding tasks. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI in education by providing empirical evidence of generative AI's effectiveness in improving learning outcomes and engagement, while also highlighting the challenges associated with integrating AI into educational settings. The findings emphasize the potential of ChatGPT to personalize learning experiences, improve performance, and offer real-time support, underscoring the need for a balanced curriculum design that incorporates AI while maintaining academic integrity and human oversight."
GUGGEMOS2022104552,Learners don't know best: Shedding light on the phenomenon of the K-12 MOOC in the context of information literacy,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have received much attention in higher education; however, evidence about MOOCs at the K-12 level is scarce. To shed light on the phenomenon, we use the i-MOOC that aims at fostering upper secondary level students’ information literacy. The i-MOOC is a blended MOOC developed and refined in a design research process; it meets established criteria for high-quality MOOCs. In 2020, 1032 upper secondary level students in German-speaking Switzerland took the i-MOOC; the sample comprises N = 167 students who voluntarily filled in a questionnaire. The students are mainly from high schools and vocational schools. Learning effects are captured with a performance test. Information literacy gains are significant and medium in size: d = 0.75. The technology acceptance of students is evaluated using the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2). Student technology acceptance of K-12 MOOCs is primarily driven by hedonic motivation, i.e., perceived fun and entertainment. However, this type of motivation negatively predicts learning gains. Implications for teachers and educational decision makers are discussed."
OH2023100602,Making computing visible & tangible: A paper-based computing toolkit for codesigning inclusive computing education activities,"MCVT (Making Computing Visible and Tangible) Cards are a toolkit of paper-based computing cards intended for use in the codesign of inclusive computing education. Working with groups of teachers and students over multiple design sessions, we share our toolkit, design drivers and material considerations; and use cases drawn from a week-long codesign workshop where seven teachers made and adapted cards for their future classroom facilitation. Our findings suggest that teachers valued the MCVT toolkit as a resource for their own learning and perceived the cards to be useful for supporting new computational practices, specifically for learning through making and connecting to examples of everyday computing. Critically reviewed by teachers during codesign workshops, the toolkit however posed some implementation challenges and constraints for learning through making and troubleshooting circuitry. From teacher surveys, interviews, workshop video recordings, and teacher-constructed projects, we show how teachers codesigned new design prototypes and pedagogical activities while also adapting and extending paper-based computing materials so their students could take advantage of the unique technical and expressive affordances of MCVT Cards. Our design research contributes a new perspective on using interactive paper computing cards as a medium for instructional materials development to support more inclusive computing education."
MAO2024100923,The effects of dynamic and static feedback under tasks with different difficulty levels in digital game-based learning,"To provide more useful feedback strategies in DGBL, this study investigated the effects of dynamic feedback (feedback contents adjusted to game task difficulty) and static feedback (the same feedback contents for all tasks) on students' learning by using an educational programming game with easy to difficult game tasks. In addition, a lag sequence analysis was used to analyze the behavior patterns of learners. A sample of 105 university students were randomly assigned to four feedback treatment conditions. The results showed that dynamic feedback, with feedback contents appropriately adjusted to the task difficulty levels (i.e., simple hints after easy game tasks and detailed explanations after difficult game tasks), were more effective in enhancing students' learning achievement and gaming engagement. Furthermore, we also found that providing detailed explanations after both easy and difficult game tasks led to a decrease in learners' engagement. The implications of findings and future research directions are discussed."
WONG2023103752,Mutually complementary effects of cyberloafing and cyber-life-interruption on employee exhaustion,"Currently, people are accustomed to cyberloafing, or nonwork-related cyber activities during working hours, and cyber-life-interruption, or work-related cyber activities during nonworking hours. Job or personal demands no longer rely on either work- or nonwork-related domain resources. We propose a dynamic demands-resources model regarding cyberloafing and cyber-life-interruption to elucidate their direct and interaction effects on work and nonwork exhaustion. By identifying these dynamics, this study can enable both employees and employers to utilize these activities for better management of employee experiences in the technology-enabled flexible working environment, which, in turn, would bring about significant implications for employee job performance."
SAIKKONEN2021104206,Multivariate analysis of teachers’ digital information skills - The importance of available resources,"Digital information skills are prerequisites for success in the information society. Previous research on 21st century skills has shown that digital skills evolve sequentially, building on digital information skills, making them the key to future skills that teachers should acquire and be able to pass on to future generations. In the research on digital skills, shortcomings of bivariate approaches have been widely identified and interest has largely shifted to multivariate methods. However, the development of effective targeted interventions still requires a deeper understanding of the social resources of individuals and the interdependencies of predictors. This study examined the extent to which sociodemographic factors and available resources predict digital information skills and which subgroups emerge as potential targets for interventions, by analysing the interdependence of the predictor variables. The empirical data used in the study consisted of 4988 Finnish teachers' questionnaire responses and performance test results. Utilising the multiple regression analysis, the study found that digital activity and age explain most of the variation in teachers' digital information skills. Their effect was found to be the inverse of each other, with abundant digital activity increasing and age reducing teachers’ mastery of these skills. Digital self-efficacy and in-service training also emerged as promising predictors, highlighting that teachers' information skills are explained more strongly by the available resources than by sociodemographic factors. At the end, the practical significance and recommendations for more targeted interventions as well as for further research are considered on the basis of the results obtained."
DING2024105075,Serious game-based learning and learning by making games: Types of game-based pedagogies and student gaming hours impact students' science learning outcomes,"Game-based learning (GBL) has garnered significant attention as a means to enhance student science learning. However, researchers often broadly categorize GBL without specific attention to teachers' practices or the different game-based pedagogies (GBPs) such as serious game-based learning and learning by making games. Serious game-based learning involves the use of games designed primarily for purposes beyond entertainment, engaging students in learning activities. Learning by making games goes further by enabling students to construct and expand their knowledge through creative activities. Furthermore, the impact of students' weekly gaming hours on their academic performance under different GBPs has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we analyzed pre- and post-science unit assessment data to investigate the effects of serious game-based learning and learning by making games, along with gaming hours, on the science learning outcomes of 129 sixth-grade students in a Midwestern urban school district in the United States. Employing Bayesian paired t-tests and ANOVA, we examined the effects of two GBPs (serious game learning and game-making) implemented by two science teachers and the interaction between each GBP and students' weekly gaming hours. Our findings indicate that both GBPs led to improvements in students’ learning, with those participating in making games showing an average increase of 3.5 points more on the posttests than those engaged in serious game-based learning. Additionally, data on student-reported weekly gaming hours showed that in both GBP conditions, students with medium gaming hours showed the most improvement compared to those with fewer or more gaming hours. There was also a potential interaction between types of GBP and the effect of gaming hours outcomes in that the learning gain difference between the two GBPs was more pronounced among students reporting fewer gaming hours, although this effect was not significant. This study contributes to the GBL field by providing practical design recommendations for integrating GBL into formal Kindergarten to 12th grade (K-12) settings, taking into account teachers' pedagogical agency and students' gaming experiences."
IVANISHCHENKO2024e28704,Understanding factors affecting fundamental school teachers’ use of technology in Luxembourg through a survey study,"Over the last few decades, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have brought about significant disruptions across nearly every industry, including education. Acknowledging the power of the digital revolution to make a positive change, educational policy makers in Luxembourg have made efforts to translate these trends into policies leveraging the potential of technologies while also tackling the challenges they present. However, these efforts and their impact on teacher ICT integration behaviors in Luxembourg are rather underexplored. The aim of the study was to examine and understand factors associated with efficient educational technology practices. The study data were collected through an online survey of 159 teachers and analyzed through a mixed-method approach, including regression and correlation analyses. Findings shed light on the connections between professional use of ICT and a set of interrelated factors such as (a) teacher attitudes followed by (b) subjective norms, (c) teacher self-efficacy beliefs, (d) facilitating conditions, (e) teacher value beliefs, and (f) fundamental pedagogical beliefs. The study also revealed possible deterrents and challenges of ICT integration in Luxembourgish fundamental schools, including gaps between teacher ICT competencies and advanced ICT uses, class management issues, and developed suggestions for professional development training to ensure efficient and advanced ICT uses in the classroom."
TORPEGAARD2022100435,Preschool children’s social and playful interactions with a play-facilitating cardboard robot,"Robots are increasingly finding roles in contexts involving children, including companions in therapy and education. Children’s perceptions of and interactions with robots is a well-researched topic, but more focus is needed on the important role of play in Child–Robot Interaction. Play is essential to how children experience the world and thereby presents both opportunities and challenges for designers who aim to create positive experiences for children involving robots. We present a study investigating how a simple play-facilitating cardboard robot becomes a social interface and create meaningful and playful experiences for preschool children. We observed 214 children engaged in free play with the robot. The analysis produced four social interaction themes and five play patterns, illustrating the most salient reactions. The results show that the robot was successful in enabling play and that the children indeed treated the robot both as a social agent, but also as a material object. In line with existing research, our observations suggest that the children attributed both animate and inanimate properties to the robot, possibly explaining the duality of the observed playground behavior. We use these findings to provide four implications for the design of play-facilitating robots."
LITTS2021100295,Examining the materiality and spatiality of design scaffolds in computational making,"As researchers focus more on engaging youth with advanced technologies to build computational skills, there is a need to develop tools that support youth to become creators of digital content rather than consumers of these technologies. Scholars refer to this shift in becoming creators of technology as computational making, which enables new forms of learning and thinking at the intersection of the physical and the digital. The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making. Our insights highlight a significant need for sharing scholarship and design work on implementing design scaffolds in computational making contexts toward the collective goal of developing a system of design scaffolds to effectively support learners’ thinking across the interdisciplinary, multimodal problem spaces unique to computational making."
KIM2022101202,A systematic review of library makerspaces research,"Despite the abundance of research on library makerspaces, systematic reviews of library makerspace research are lacking. As research on library makerspaces advances, the field needs reliable empirical findings to examine the impact of library makerspaces and identify research areas that are valuable for future research. Guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement, 43 out of 838 records were selected for the systematic review. The overall trend of research methodologies and theories, settings, participants, research purposes, as well as tools, technologies and programming in library makerspace research were identified. The findings reveal that qualitative studies that were descriptive in nature were the predominant approaches. While appropriate literatures were explored, theoretical frameworks were less used. This systematic review contributes new areas and directions for future research, including the need for expansion of research methodologies and theoretical frameworks and investigation of diverse users and types of making."
LI2020103899,Longitudinal clustering of students’ self-regulated learning behaviors in engineering design,"It is vital to develop an understanding of students' self-regulatory processes in the domains of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) for the quality delivery of STEM education. However, most studies have followed a variable-centered approach, leaving open the question of how specific SRL (Self-regulated Learning) behaviors group within individual learners. Furthermore, little is known about how students' SRL profiles unfold over time in STEM education, specifically in the context of engineering design. In this study, we examined the change of students’ SRL profiles over time as 108 middle school students designed green buildings in a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We identified three distinct SRL profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and minimally self-regulated learners. In addition, we found that students with different profile memberships differed significantly in their design performance. Specifically, adaptive self-regulated learners outperformed minimally self-regulated learners on design completeness, whereas reflective-oriented self-regulated learners demonstrated higher design efficiency than minimally self-regulated learners. This study provides researchers with both theoretical and methodological insights concerning SRL dynamics. Findings from this research also inform practitioners about the design of adaptive interventions."
CAKIR2021100812,The effect of robotic coding education on preschoolers’ problem solving and creative thinking skills,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of robotics and coding instruction on preschoolers’ problem-solving skills and creative thinking abilities. Designed as a quasi-experimental research with pretest–posttest control groups, this study was conducted in a preschool in Amasya province of Turkey. A total of 40 preschool students were recruited in this study. The data were collected through ‘the Problem-Solving Skill Scale (PSSS)’ and ‘the Creative Thinking Abilities Test’. The experimental procedure lasted for four weeks, and a total of 32 -h lesson was conducted. During the procedure in the experimental group, WeDo 2.0 Educational Robotics Kit was employed, while pen and paper activities were conducted in the control group. The participants in the experimental group performed ‘GlowingSnail’, ‘Moovingsatellite’, ‘Spacecraft’, ‘Milo Science’, ‘Milo’s Motion Sensory Robot’, and ‘Frog Robot’ activities, whereas those in the control group read such stories as ‘Winnie the Witch under the Sea’, ‘Where Do Emotions and Broken Hearts Go’, ‘the Aliens Activity’, and ‘Timing, and listened to ‘the Planets’ song. The results show that robotics and coding instruction has provided statistically significant contribution to preschoolers’ problem-solving skills compared to the pen and paper activities. Further, imagination and originality factors in the language domain as well as completion, new elements addition, and unconventionality factors in the drawing domain were found to be statistically significant compared to the other factors. Several limitations and recommendations are provided."
HUANG2022104577,Trends and exemplary practices of STEM teacher professional development programs in K-12 contexts: A systematic review of empirical studies,"STEM teachers are critical mediators of knowledge, and their performance can directly impact students' learning experiences and knowledge acquisition. To ensure the quality of STEM instruction, countries worldwide have launched STEM teacher professional development (TPD) programs. It is paramount to know how these programs have been implemented and what lessons can be learned from them. In this study, to capture the trends in publications on K-12 STEM TPD, we systematically reviewed relevant journal papers published in the Web of Science database from 2006 to 2020. We analyzed the (1) knowledge foci, (2) professional development approaches, (3) outcome measurements, as well as (4) data sources of the STEM TPDs. In addition, to inform future professional development designs, we selected and developed narrative descriptions of three exemplary cases. These cases showcased high-quality TPD and covered pre-service and in-service teachers in formal and informal settings. We reviewed the knowledge foci of the STEM TPDs using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The results showed that the types of knowledge delivered in the STEM TPD programs were mostly pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, while a certain number of programs focused on technological content knowledge and technological pedagogical content knowledge. Most of the studies adopted mixed professional development approaches, featuring activities like learning by design, learning by doing, reflective learning, and group work. These approaches emphasized the active participation of teachers in the process, built links between content and classroom practices, and encouraged collective participation in developing expertise. However, the data were mostly collected through interviews or survey instruments. Future research should move beyond analyzing data on teachers’ perceptions to explore processes (e.g., online participation logs, teacher-peer interactions) and products of performance (e.g., lesson plans, handmade crafts) to further examine the effects of STEM TPD activities. It would also be desirable to establish greater consistency in data collection approaches, such as by using validated interview or observation protocols that are generalizable to different school settings."
JINNA2025104141,Bias in online reviews: The roles played by consumers and products in reviewing online games,"Prior research on online reviews has focused on investigating either the bias inherent in providing these reviews or the characteristics of users or products that lead to positive reviews. This study is different in that it controls for self-selection bias and incorporates both consumer and product characteristics, thereby providing a more realistic and holistic view of their impact on both the volume and the valence of reviews. We explore these issues in the context of a rapidly growing industry—online games—and use an uncensored dataset of game purchasers from a large online gaming platform. We examine consumer characteristics including friendship, ownership, and usage and product characteristics such as age, atypicality, and price. We draw on theories from information systems, marketing, and sociology to explain review and rating behaviors and create consumer segments by using the product's atypicality attributes to calculate consumers’ atypicality and variety-seeking levels. By distinguishing between review propensity (volume) and likelihood of a positive review (valence), we conclude that controlling for the propensity to review changes the previously held orthodoxy regarding the likelihood of a positive review. By exploring a more complete set of explanatory factors and testing our hypotheses on a large, uncensored dataset, our work provides a clearer picture of the intermingled influence of consumer and product characteristics on the provision of online reviews and their valence."
BRESSAN2020104475,Evaluation of machine learning methods for lithology classification using geophysical data,"Specific computational tools assist geologists in identifying and sorting lithologies in well surveys and reducing operational costs and practical working time. This allows for the management of professional output, the efficient interpretation of data, and completion of scientific research on data collected in geologically distinct regions. Machine learning methods and applications integrate large sets of information with the goal of efficient pattern recognition and the capability of leveraging accurate decision making. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning methods to the supervised classification of lithologies using multivariate log parameter data from offshore wells from the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). According to the analysis of the lithologies proposed in the IODP Expeditions and for the application of our methods, the lithologies were divided into four groups. The IODP Expeditions were organized into four templates for better results in analyzing the set of expeditions and practical application of the methods. The templates were submitted to training, validation, and testing by multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The evaluation was randomly divided into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) using the classification methods as an evaluation of the results. In the results, it was observed that Template1 (IODP Expedition 362) obtained better results with the MLP method, Template2 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, and 359) and Template3 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, 359, and 362) obtained better results with the random forest method with greater than 80.00% accuracy. For cross-validation, the random forest method performed well in all scenarios. In the practical template, the G2 group obtained a better result with the MLP method with an average accuracy above 85.00%. It is expected that machine learning methods can help improve the study of geology with accurate and rapid answers related to interpreting collected data in different study regions."
RAHIMI2024100258,The role of ChatGPT readiness in shaping language teachers' language teaching innovation and meeting accountability: A bisymmetric approach,"There are some dichotomies surrounding ChatGPT's application and impact on education as a central part of artificial intelligence (AI) integration. Problems concerning negative preconceptions and the limited usage of this form of AI have been reported, as some teachers perceive it as a competitor. This is due to insufficient readiness for its integration and a lack of understanding of how it can facilitate teaching innovation. Due to this, the researchers applied a bisymmetric approach, where necessity conditional analysis (NCA) as a symmetrical approach employs necessity logic to identify the must-have factors required for language teachers' passing accountability, while PLS-SEM as an asymmetrical approach follows additive sufficiency logic to identify the should-have factors that contribute to helping them to pass their accountability. Applying this approach would generate more results from different perspectives in ChatGPT readiness and language teaching innovation with it. In this line, the researchers randomly explored 124 Iranian in-service language teachers ChatGPT readiness and their teaching innovation in helping them pass the external and internal language teaching competencies. The result of the PLS-SEM showed that the more the language teachers were ready to practically use ChatGPT alongside, aware of its opportunities and challenges in English language teaching (ELT), the more they could generate more language teaching methods and approaches with it, apply them to their language teaching procedures, and share them with their colleagues. Moreover, their generational language teaching methods with ChatGPT mediated the correlation between ChatGPT readiness and meeting internal accountability. Additionally, the NCA showed that the generation of language teaching methods with ChatGPT and their implementation through it were among the necessary factors that help language teachers meet both internal and external accountability by teaching language with ChatGPT. Based on these findings, the researchers recommended that stakeholders shift their focus from AI programming to AI teaching, especially for ELT."
WIESE2025100405,AI ethics education: A systematic literature review,"The potential of AI technology to transform human life, well-being, and daily work is faced with numerous risks and challenges yet to be fully accounted for. However, the complexity of AI ethics makes it hard to pin down what to teach, how to teach it, and how to assess its effectiveness. Drawing on an educational perspective, this paper presents a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of the early years of AI ethics education as a formalized field to analyze whether its future trajectory is aligned with educational best practices. Our review highlights core challenges in AI ethics education and the content, assessment, and pedagogy used in real interventions over recent years. We find that efforts to teach AI ethics do helpfully draw on a holistic view (as opposed to a narrow view), and utilize progressive pedagogies like case studies and group projects that aim to meaningfully challenge students’ ethical reasoning skills in applied practices. However, many real- world AI ethics teaching interventions do not leverage well-supported assessment techniques known to support student learning; rather, assessment is conducted primarily for research evaluative purposes. This gap in rigorous assessment raises implications for researchers and practitioners, as responsible development and use of AI will be stymied if educators cannot successfully determine whether students have truly learned relevant AI ethics content or skills."
CHEAH2023103984,"Unpacking K-12 teachers’ technology-supported, equitable practices: A mixed-methods systematic review","We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of research literature from 2009 to 2019 to unpack researchers' conceptualizations about, approaches toward, and environmental supports in place that framed K-12 teachers' technology-supported, equitable practices. Findings revealed that equitable learning with technology was conceptualized as: (1) lifting students up through a neoliberal perspective; (2) attending to individual needs; (3) empowering students’ agency and civic participation; and (4) providing equal learning opportunities. Technology approaches and environmental supports in tandem with these four conceptualizations are articulated. Finally, we discuss the need for teachers to be reflective practitioners and critical enquirers when leveraging technology to promote equitable learning."
OPRISAN2022101642,Interdisciplinary curriculum for computational neuroscience at primarily undergraduate institutions,"Developing interdisciplinary undergraduate courses is challenging at all levels; it requires involving trained faculty who can successfully cover more than one discipline and creating a new curriculum that crosses discipline boundaries. While such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. However, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. As part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called Biophysical Modeling of Excitable Cells (BMEC). The course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. It focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy, and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. This course also provides pedagogical experience for senior Ph.D. students in Neuroscience. BMEC is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates’ ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. The class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biology/psychology and physics/mathematics oriented. The teamwork allows students with more substantial biology/psychology backgrounds to explain to physics/mathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. Simultaneously, students with substantial physics/mathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes. This study expands on Oprisan (2021) by including examples of hands-on activities, student projects, and a brief overview of course assessment tools and results. This study also includes more recent approaches to teaching computational neuroscience using cloud computing."
MURAI2024100631,Making as an opportunity for classroom assessment: Canadian maker educators’ views on assessment,"A growing number of studies have shown that the exploratory, collaborative, and contextualized nature of maker activities create opportunities for learners to engage with knowledge in a uniquely different way from traditional education which largely relies on de-contextualized instructions. The increased integration of making into K-12 curricula has enormous implications not only for instructional design but also for assessment practices. Maker-oriented activities have the potential to shed light on types of learning that previous assessment systems have not captured and examined. Nevertheless, little is discussed on how making can contribute to the assessment and instructional practices at large. This case study investigated educators' experiences with assessment in classrooms integrating maker activities. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with six K-12 educators in Canada, the researchers examined: (1) in what ways does making activities create opportunities for assessment and instruction in K-12 classrooms? (2) in what ways does maker learning become a challenge for assessment and instruction in K-12 classrooms? Our analysis revealed several ways in which teachers experienced the advantages of the making approach for understanding student learning and for helping students become further aware of their own progress. The results also revealed challenges to conducting assessments for maker learning, including administrative challenges like continuing to gain support from the administration, and literacy challenges such as students’ obsession with letter grades. This study provides insights into how making may help improve assessment and instructional practices in K-12 classrooms."
VANDERSTAP2024105103,Towards teaching strategies addressing online learning in blended learning courses for adult-learners,"Blended learning offers a learner-centred approach that employs both in-class learning and digital technology to facilitate online learning. Such an approach is especially advantageous to adult-learners in higher education as it meets their educational needs. However, adult-learners’ participation in blended learning programmes remains challenging due to a general lack of online interaction, and no clear teaching strategies that address this concern. Literature relating to adult-learners’ educational needs and online interaction was consulted in order to design teaching strategies that foster adult-learners’ online interaction. The aim of this study is to further validate these teaching strategies, hence a multiple case study was carried out using a mixed method approach. As such, eight teachers and sixteen students from four courses across three universities in Belgium and the Netherlands were interviewed. Additionally, a questionnaire testing a pre-defined set of variables was distributed to 84 students. The results lead to a set of validated teaching strategies that help teachers to further develop their professional skills and expertise. The teaching strategies can be grouped into three categories, namely 1) the teacher's online presence, 2) collaborative learning activities and preparatory learning activities, and 3) the distribution of learning content and learning activities across online and in-class learning. An elaborate set of validated teaching strategies is included. This study aids towards teacher professional development and adds evidence-based knowledge to teaching strategies and instructional frameworks for adult-learners in higher education.

STARK2024102662,Gaze-based attention network analysis in a virtual reality classroom,"This article provides a step-by-step guideline for measuring and analyzing visual attention in 3D virtual reality (VR) environments based on eye-tracking data. We propose a solution to the challenges of obtaining relevant eye-tracking information in a dynamic 3D virtual environment and calculating interpretable indicators of learning and social behavior. With a method called ""gaze-ray casting,"" we simulated 3D-gaze movements to obtain information about the gazed objects. This information was used to create graphical models of visual attention, establishing attention networks. These networks represented participants' gaze transitions between different entities in the VR environment over time. Measures of centrality, distribution, and interconnectedness of the networks were calculated to describe the network structure. The measures, derived from graph theory, allowed for statistical inference testing and the interpretation of participants' visual attention in 3D VR environments. Our method provides useful insights when analyzing students’ learning in a VR classroom, as reported in a corresponding evaluation article with N = 274 participants. •Guidelines on implementing gaze-ray casting in VR using the Unreal Engine and the HTC VIVE Pro Eye.•Creating gaze-based attention networks and analyzing their network structure.•Implementation tutorials and the Open Source software code are provided via OSF: https://osf.io/pxjrc/?view_only=1b6da45eb93e4f9eb7a138697b941198."
DELGADOMARTIN2022100281,DEIFDC framework: Evaluation of digital education deployment in India in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic,"The Digital Education Index for Developing Countries (DEIFDC) is a compound index that considers nine different variables grouped in three main levers that have been researched relevant to assess the overall state of readiness of Digital Education deployment in a developing country. Digital Education has been approached from an instrumental point of view, focusing on the advantages that the introduction at an early stage of digital tools brings to the teaching and learning processes to ensure children can acquire the required 21st competencies of a future workforce. In the application for the Indian case, social, cultural, economic and educational data obtained through desk research during the first semester of 2021 has been taken into consideration. Despite significant Government efforts on scaling up Digital Education, primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic school closure, the 0.596 DEIFDC score on a 0–1 possible range has shown Inadequate Digital Education Deployment, derived mainly from poor school infrastructure, limited pedagogical capabilities and modest students' skills. Furthermore, the socio-demographic differences observed among school children and the existent digital divide in rural and urban areas demonstrate that major effort needs to be undertaken to ensure vulnerable Indian population does not lag behind under the new rules of the Digital Economy."
LOCKWOOD2021100857,Reinforcing key combinatorial ideas in a computational setting: A case of encoding outcomes in computer programming,"Counting problems are difficult for students to solve, and there is a perennial need to investigate ways to help students solve counting problems successfully. One promising avenue for students’ successful counting is for them to think judiciously about how they encode outcomes – that is, how they symbolize and represent the outcomes they are trying to count. We provide a detailed case study of two students as they encoded outcomes in their work on several related counting problems within a computational setting. We highlight the role that a computational environment may have played in this encoding activity. We illustrate ways in which by-hand work and computer programming worked together to facilitate the students’ successful encoding activity. This case demonstrates ways in which the activity of computation seemed to interact with by-hand work to facilitate sophisticated encoding of outcomes."
CHEN2023100184,Integrating generative AI in knowledge building,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is penetrating in various social sectors, motivating a strong need for teaching AI literacy in younger generations. While substantial efforts have been made to teach AI literacy and to use AI to facilitate learning, few studies have provided empirical accounts of students' nuanced processes of using GenAI for learning. In this study, we engaged a group of high school students in leveraging ChatGPT to support their knowledge building efforts. Following the teacher's pedagogical design, students used ChatGPT for a range of distinct purposes. Student interviews showed detailed processes of using ChatGPT for knowledge building and students' emerging AI literacy in multiple dimensions. This study offers practical implications for the integration of GenAI in K-12 education and urges educators to create spaces and scaffolds for students to mindfully engage with GenAI in the classroom."
GONCHAROW2021316,CS-Materials: A system for classifying and analyzing pedagogical materials to improve adoption of parallel and distributed computing topics in early CS courses,"The NSF/IEEE-TCPP Parallel and Distributed Computing curriculum guidelines released in 2012 (PDC12) represents an effort to bring more parallel computing concepts into early computer science courses. To date, it has been moderately successful, with the inclusion of some PDC topics in the ACM/IEEE Computer Science curriculum guidelines in 2013 (CS13) and mentions of PDC topics in the Computing Curricula 2020. Additionally, some universities in the U.S. and around the world have started to cover some of these topics in early CS courses. Lack of knowledge of or training in PDC topics among instructors, along with the need to align early CS course content with prescribed learning objectives in the curricula, are often cited as hurdles for adoption in early CS courses. There have been attempts at bringing PDC materials, such as textbook chapters, lecture slides, assignments, and demos to assist instructors of early CS classes. However, the effort required on the part of the instructor to figure out what is relevant to a particular class can be daunting. In this work, we contend that simultaneously classifying pedagogical materials against the CS13 and the PDC12 curriculum guidelines can address some of the challenges faced by instructors and can promote broader adoption of PDC materials in early CS courses. We present CS Materials, a system that can be used to categorize pedagogical materials according to well-known and established curricular guidelines. We show that CS Materials can be leveraged 1) by instructors of early CS courses to find materials that are similar to the one that they use but that also cover PDC topics, and 2) by instructors to check the coverage of topics (and gaps) in a course, and 3) by PDC experts to identify topics for which PDC instructional materials do not exist or are insufficient in order to inform development of additional PDC curricular materials."
HSIAO2021102312,Who captures whom – Pokémon or tourists? A perspective of the Stimulus-Organism-Response model,"Since its launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has attracted huge numbers of players, causing a boom in this game market. Although it is not as popular as before, from time to time we still find crowds of players gathered in some spots where Pokémon appear. Numerous reports have explored this Pokémon phenomenon; however, the exact reasons for its popularity remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the post-adoption behavior of Pokémon Go players and its influential factors in the gaming and tourism industries. The theoretical model of stimulus-organism-response was drawn on to examine the impact of the environmental stimuli (social influence and media influence) on players’ internal organisms, which in turn affect their post-experience responses. Moreover, gender differences were also examined in the hypothetical relationships. A total of 342 valid questionnaires from actual gamers were collected in this study, and data analysis was performed using a structural equation model. The results show that stimulus effects, such as social stimuli (critical mass and social interaction) and media stimuli (content timeliness and media richness), have significant impacts on the players’ internal gamified experience (attachment and conformity), which in turn affect their visit intention to catch creatures at certain attractions and to continue playing Pokémon Go. Further, we have also found that players’ intention to visit Pokémon spots is significantly correlated with their intention to continue playing the game. Findings provide links between gamification and tourism literature. Further theoretical and managerial implications are provided."

CHEN2020100002,Application and theory gaps during the rise of Artificial Intelligence in Education,"Considering the increasing importance of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and the absence of a comprehensive review on it, this research aims to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of influential AIEd studies. We analyzed 45 articles in terms of annual distribution, leading journals, institutions, countries/regions, the most frequently used terms, as well as theories and technologies adopted. We also evaluated definitions of AIEd from broad and narrow perspectives and clarified the relationship among AIEd, Educational Data Mining, Computer-Based Education, and Learning Analytics. Results indicated that: 1) there was a continuingly increasing interest in and impact of AIEd research; 2) little work had been conducted to bring deep learning technologies into educational contexts; 3) traditional AI technologies, such as natural language processing were commonly adopted in educational contexts, while more advanced techniques were rarely adopted, 4) there was a lack of studies that both employ AI technologies and engage deeply with educational theories. Findings suggested scholars to 1) seek the potential of applying AI in physical classroom settings; 2) spare efforts to recognize detailed entailment relationships between learners’ answers and the desired conceptual understanding within intelligent tutoring systems; 3) pay more attention to the adoption of advanced deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial network and deep neural network; 4) seek the potential of NLP in promoting precision or personalized education; 5) combine biomedical detection and imaging technologies such as electroencephalogram, and target at issues regarding learners’ during the learning process; and 6) closely incorporate the application of AI technologies with educational theories."

HULSEN202169,Chapter 4 - Challenges and solutions for big data in personalized healthcare,"“Big data” is a term that has been used often in the past decade to describe datasets that are extremely large and complex so that traditional software is unable to store and analyze them in an accurate way. It can refer to “long data,” “wide data,” and both. Big data is of increasing importance in healthcare as well: new methods dedicated to improving data collection, storage, cleaning, processing, and interpretation for medical research continue to be developed. Exploiting new tools and methods to extract meaning from large volume information has the potential to drive real change in clinical practice, and combining this novel data-driven research with the classical hypothesis-driven research will have a large impact on personalized healthcare. However, significant challenges remain. Here we discuss the challenges (and possible solutions) posed to biomedical research by our increasing ability to collect, store, and analyze large datasets. Important challenges include: (1) the need for standardization of data content, format, and clinical definitions, adhering to the FAIR guiding principles; (2) the need for collaborative networks with sharing of both data and expertise, for example through a federated approach; (3) stricter privacy and ethics regulations, in particular the GDPR in the European Union; and (4) a need to reconsider how and when analytic methodology (data science) is taught to medical researchers. Overcoming these challenges will help to make a success of the use of big data in medical and translational research."
IIVARI2023100600,Computational empowerment of children: Design research on empowering and impactful designs by children,"Prioritizing children’s empowerment in and through design has been on the agenda of child–computer interaction (CCI) research for a long time. Recently, the notion of the computational empowerment of children has received attention. However, there are still open issues in our understanding and advocacy of it. A related development is the recent interest in the longer-term impacts of our work. Fast and furious participation of children in design sessions is considered inadequate. We should advocate for longer-term trajectories and possibilities for children to make changes that will influence our world. However, the literature is limited in addressing longer-term impacts. This study taps into these two research gaps and showcases how we have addressed the computational empowerment of children in a project tackling bullying at school through critical design and making. In this paper, we examine in detail the children’s designs and their trajectories from the viewpoint of empowerment and impact: whether and how these children’s designs show potential for the empowerment of those bullied and whether and how their designs have had an impact in the realm of digital technology development. Our study has interesting conceptual and methodological implications for CCI research and practice on the computational empowerment of children and on our design research practice."
ISMAILOVA2021332,Equalities between Combinators to Evaluate Expressions,"One of the aims of this work is to revise the known issues of how to obtain the value of the expression using an applicative computing system. Computation and/or symbolic transformations have undoubtedly become one of the dominant trends in modern computer science. In particular, this refers to the execution of the processes of inference of an object with given properties, which is studied with the formation of sets of equalities leading to a target computational model. At the same time, the mathematical theory of computation gets a target equational description, making the process of studying its properties and capabilities more suitable. A model structure based on the method of indexed expressions is developed and applied using the notions of evaluation mapping and assignments. As shown, this may not be considered as generic notion, but derived using the combinators. Thus, the semantics of computation can be derived from the construction of a combinator-as-process. This is the embedding into a system of combinators. A linking system of equalities between combinatorsl is established, which serving as a generic computational model. This allows us to look differently at the previous cognitive ideas of the semantics of computation disabling an evaluation map and assignments and enabling their replacement by a set of equalities between combinators."
IIVARI2022100408,Critical agenda driving child–computer interaction research—Taking a stock of the past and envisioning the future,"There is a revitalized interest in power and politics around design and technology in the Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) field. Child–Computer Interaction (CCI) research community has also shown arousing interest towards the topic. However, despite this emerging interest, the CCI research community has remained quite silent about the potential of a critical agenda for CCI. Few studies have explicitly addressed critical research or critical design. This study introduces the notion of a critical agenda for CCI research and identifies CCI studies that are linked with the critical agenda, revealing that there are CCI studies showing emerging interests and seeds for addressing the critical agenda. Overall, this study explores the state-of-the-art critical research tradition in CCI and explicates the potential of this tradition for making the world a better place through design and technology in collaboration with children."
LI2020103987,Examining temporal dynamics of self-regulated learning behaviors in STEM learning: A network approach,"From a network perspective, self-regulated learning (SRL) can be conceptualized as networks of mutually interacting self-regulatory learning behaviors. Nevertheless, the research on how SRL behaviors dynamically interact over time in a network architecture is still in its infancy, especially in the context of STEM (sciences, technology, engineering, and math) learning. In the present paper, we used a multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) model to examine the temporal dynamics of SRL behaviors as 101 students designed green buildings in Energy3D, a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We examined how different performance groups (i.e., unsuccessful, success-oriented, and mastery-oriented groups) differed in SRL competency, actual SRL behaviors, and SRL networks. We found that the three groups had no significant difference in their perceived SRL competency; however, they differed in SRL behaviors of evaluation. Both the mastery-oriented and success-oriented groups performed more evaluation behaviors than the unsuccessful group. Moreover, the mastery-oriented group showed stronger interaction between SRL behaviors than the success-oriented group and the unsuccessful group. The SRL networks of the three groups shared some similarities, but they were different from each other in general. This study has significant theoretical and methodological implications for the advancement of research in SRL dynamics."
KNIGHT2020100729,Implementing learning analytics for learning impact: Taking tools to task,"Learning analytics has the potential to impact student learning, at scale. Embedded in that claim are a set of assumptions and tensions around the nature of scale, impact on student learning, and the scope of infrastructure encompassed by ‘learning analytics’ as a socio-technical field. Drawing on our design experience of developing learning analytics and inducting others into its use, we present a model that we have used to address five key challenges we have encountered. In developing this model, we recommend: A focus on impact on learning through augmentation of existing practice; the centrality of tasks in implementing learning analytics for impact on learning; the commensurate centrality of learning in evaluating learning analytics; inclusion of co-design approaches in implementing learning analytics across sites; and an attention to both social and technical infrastructure."
ZHANG2023108553,"Structural renovation of blocks in build-up area of Jiangnan cities, taking Suzhou new district as an example","Summary
The rationality of block scale and structure is the guarantee of vitality and humanization quality, facing complex and diverse problems, and the structure reconstruction of urban built-up areas is one of the most difficult challenges in the process of promoting the block system. The traditional planning-construction strategy, as practice in recent years has demonstrated, faces challenges in terms of construction costs, demolition costs, property rights, and jurisprudence. Based on the interaction of the block structure and external space, the study presents a “implant-reconstruction” model. It investigates possibilities of implanting elements and graphically depicts the potential impact of implant-reconstruction using Space Syntax. The findings indicate that the external space implantation mode may actively encourage the construction of small-scale blocks and has benefits in terms of texture respect, low impact, and ease of operation. The simulation and pre-judgment dynamically illustrate the viable path and gives a scientific reference for block alteration."
LAURIE2022100384,The role of robotic toys in shaping play and joint engagement in autistic children: Implications for future design,"Autistic children are thought to develop social attention skills differently from non-autistic children. Previous work has shown that technology, and specifically tangible toys, could have the potential to support social attention in autistic children. A key challenge is knowing how to design and use interactive and intelligent technologies to support interaction in autistic children, given the heterogeneity in levels of social motivation, social development, and interest in digital technologies. To address this challenge, we examined in detail the interaction between digital features and autistic children’s joint engagement in a real-world setting, exploring the impact of tangible constraints in fostering social interaction. The current study observed autistic children (aged between 12 and 15 years) playing with a digital robotic toy and a non-digital counterpart, and measured social attention and engagement during free play. The results showed that increased and higher levels of joint attention when children had to share a toy between them, on both digital and non-digital interfaces. We found that autistic children individually vary in their propensity to engage in social interactions, as well as their responses to digital features. This work contributes to a growing area of evidence that tangible and smart technologies can create social opportunities for autistic children."
PAL2020105535,Perceived usability evaluation of Microsoft Teams as an online learning platform during COVID-19 using system usability scale and technology acceptance model in India,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a physical shutdown of all types of educational institutes worldwide due to which the education delivery has now shifted to an “online only” exclusivity model. In this perspective, perceived usability of the online learning platforms that are currently being used is an important aspect, especially due to the absence of any physical classes. In this work Microsoft Teams is used as the reference platform for which the perceived usability is evaluated. For the evaluation purpose a dual strategy is followed by using the System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) based approach, and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which is an Information Systems (IS) based approach. Although both these instruments are popular in their respective domains, yet they have not been considered simultaneously in one work for the purpose of usability evaluation. By doing so, this work attempts to streamline and unify the process of usability evaluation. Results that are obtained from a large-scale survey of university students show the similarity and equivalency between the two methodologies, with the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) construct of TAM having greater similarity with SUS. Moreover, this work also considers the digital-divide aspect (mobile vs. web environment) that is prevalent particularly in developing countries like India, and whether it has any effect on the perceived usability. Results show that the consumption platform does not have any effect on the usability aspect."
LAW2021100321,Augmented reality applications for K-12 education: A systematic review from the usability and user experience perspective,"In the past two decades, we have witnessed soaring efforts in applying Augmented Reality (AR) technology in education. Several systematic literature reviews (SLRs) were conducted to study AR educational applications (AREAs) and associated methodologies, primarily from the pedagogical rather than from the human–computer interaction (HCI) perspective. These reviews vary in goal, scale, scope, technique, outcome and quality. To bridge the gaps identified in these SLRs, ours is to meet fourfold objectives: to ground the analysis deeper in the usability and user experience (UX) core concepts and methods; to study the learning effect and usability/UX of AREAs and their relations by learner age; to reflect on the prevailing SLR process and propose improvement; to draw implications for the future development of AREAs. Our searches in four databases returned 714 papers of which 42, together with 7 from three existing SLRs, were included in the final analysis. Several intriguing findings have been identified: (i) the insufficient grounding in usability/UX frameworks indicates that there seems a disconnection between the HCI and technology-enhanced learning community; (ii) a lack of innovative AR-specific usability/UX evaluation methods and the continuing reliance on questionnaire may hamper the advances of AREAs; (iii) the learner age seems not a significant factor in determining the perceived usability and UX or the learning effect of AREAs; (iv) a limited number of studies at home suggests the missed opportunity of mobilizing parents to support children to deploy AREAs in different settings; (v) the number of AREAs for children with special needs remains disappointedly low; (vi) the threat of predatory journals to the quality of bibliometric sources amplifies the need for a robust approach to the quality assessment for SLR and transparency of interim results. Implications of these issues for future research and practice on AREAs are drawn."
STEPHENS2021103466,Landscape changes and their hydrologic effects: Interactions and feedbacks across scales,"Human activities have extensively altered landscapes throughout the world and further changes are expected in the future. Anthropogenic impacts such as land use change, groundwater extraction and dam construction, along with the effects of climate change, interact with natural factors including soil weathering and erosion. Together, these processes create a constantly shifting, dynamic terrestrial environment that violates the assumption of stationarity commonly applied in hydrology. Consequently, hydrologists need to rethink both statistical and calibrated models to account for complex environmental processes. We review the literature on human-landscape-hydrological interactions to identify processes and feedbacks that influence water balances. Most of the papers covered consider only a few of these processes at a time and focus on structural attributes of the interactions rather than the short and long-term dynamics. We identify challenges in representing the scale-dependence, environmental connectivity and human-water interactions that characterize complex, dynamic landscapes. A synthesis of the findings posits connections between different landscape changes, as well as the associated timescales and level of certainty. A case study explores how different processes could combine to drive long-term shifts in catchment behavior. Recognizing that some important questions remain unaddressed by traditional approaches, we suggest the concept of ‘big laboratories’ in which multifaceted experiments are conducted in the environment by artificially inducing landscape change. These experiments would be accompanied by mechanistic modeling to both untangle experimental results and improve the theoretical basis of environmental models. An ambitious program of physical and virtual experimentation is needed to progress hydrologic prediction for dynamic landscapes.
Plain language summary
The Earth’s surface is constantly changing due to human-driven and natural processes. Shifts may be driven by humans directly (e.g. via land use change) or indirectly (e.g. by driving climate change that causes shifts in ecological communities). Other changes are natural, such as certain soil processes that lead to shifts in texture and properties over time. In many places, landscape change is now occurring at unprecedented rates. This impacts the water cycle, creating a need for models that are robust under changing conditions. Our paper synthesizes a wide range of literature on key aspects of landscape change that have wide-ranging implications for hydrology. We focus on the impacts of processes at different spatial and temporal scales, along with feedbacks between various environmental and anthropogenic shifts. We discuss connections between different landscape changes and the timescales over which they each affect the water cycle. A case study is presented to highlight the potential for cascading landscape disturbances that could alter long-term catchment response. Recognizing limitations in traditional data collection and modeling, we introduce the concept of ‘big laboratories’ to conduct environmental experiments under landscape change, providing an avenue for addressing the complex questions around hydrology in a changing world."
DESORDI2022100659,"Dark, down, and destructive side of entrepreneurship: Unveiling negative aspects of unsuccessful entrepreneurial action","Studies associated with critical analyses of entrepreneurship education (EE) highlight the predominance of literatures that focus closely on the positive aspects of entrepreneurship. This can lead to cognitive bias, resulting in students developing more favorable and even enthusiastic perceptions of entrepreneurial action. To reduce this information asymmetry, the intention of this study was to identify and classify the diversity of negative aspects resulting from unsuccessful entrepreneurial action. To this end, we applied the content analysis technique to the transcripts of interviews with former entrepreneurs and stakeholders associated with entrepreneurial action, in addition to the texts of articles from important journals of Entrepreneurship and Small Business identified through a scope literature review. The findings indicate that unsuccessful entrepreneurial action can result in several negative effects for the entrepreneur, both subjectively (psychological and social aspects - dark side) and objectively (material aspects - downside). The study also identified several negative effects that impact other individuals and society (destructive side). The literature review and interaction with former entrepreneurs and professionals who work with entrepreneurs showed 38 negative aspects in the three dimensions known as “Triple Ds” (dark, destructive and downside). A taxonomy tree was developed that integrates these different types and subtypes, as well as software (https://thetripleds.com/) that makes these contents available. These resources can be used by EE professors, managers and technicians of agencies that support entrepreneurs to raise the awareness of potential entrepreneurs regarding the various risks associated with entrepreneurial action."
CARETTE202215,Chapter Two - Embracing the laws of physics: Three reversible models of computation,"Our main models of computation (the Turing Machine and the RAM) and most modern computer architectures make fundamental assumptions about which primitive operations are realizable on a physical computing device. The consensus is that these primitive operations include logical operations like conjunction, disjunction and negation, as well as reading and writing to a large collection of memory locations. This perspective conforms to a macro-level view of physics and indeed these operations are realizable using macro-level devices involving thousands of electrons. This point of view is however incompatible with computation realized using quantum devices or analyzed using elementary thermodynamics as both these fundamental physical theories imply that information is a conserved quantity of physical processes and hence of primitive computational operations. Our aim is to redevelop foundational computational models in a way that embraces the principle of conservation of information. We first define what information is and what its conservation means in a computational setting. We emphasize the idea that computations must be reversible transformations on data. One can think of data as modeled using topological spaces and programs as modeled by reversible deformations of these spaces. We then illustrate this idea using three notions of data and their associated reversible computational models. The first instance only assumes unstructured finite data, i.e., discrete topological spaces. The corresponding notion of reversible computation is that of permutations. We show how this simple model subsumes conventional computations on finite sets. We then consider a modern structured notion of data based on the Curry–Howard correspondence between logic and type theory. We develop the corresponding notion of reversible deformations using a sound and complete programming language for witnessing type isomorphisms and proof terms for commutative semirings. We then “move up a level” to examine spaces that treat programs as data, which is a crucial notion for any universal model of computation. To derive the corresponding notion of reversible programs between programs, i.e., reversible program equivalences, we look at the “higher dimensional” analog to commutative semirings: symmetric rig groupoids. The coherence laws for these groupoids turn out to be exactly the sound and complete reversible program equivalences we seek. We conclude with some possible generalizations inspired by homotopy type theory and survey several open directions for further research."

ALFOUDARI2021104282,Understanding socio-technological challenges of smart classrooms using a systematic review,"Smart classrooms are paradigm innovations for enhanced learning behavior in digital learning environments. These environments offer benefits for inclusive and virtual learning, underscoring the need for assessments of current practices. Although research on smart classrooms propose models and systems for enhancing socio-technological integration, knowledge on socio-technological challenges of smart classrooms remains limited. This article applies a systematic review methodology in line with the PRISMA protocol and analyzes current social and technological challenges based on 105 articles published between 2000 and 2019. The review identifies social challenges that facilitate personalization for external factors and teaching methods, stimulate learner-oriented content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement, and boost interactivity depending on the willingness of learners and instructors. The review also finds technological challenges that concern designing learning environments and integrating intelligent systems, analytical tools and analysis, system models and ontology, and mobile and social media applications. The review suggests areas for future research involving smart classroom design for continuity and consistency, quality attributes of smart classrooms, efficiency and sustainability of smart classroom infrastructure, and the development of a smart classroom modelling language."
MOORE2024493,"Chapter 17 - The application of knowledge in soil microbiology, ecology, and biochemistry (SMEB) to the solution of today’s and future societal needs","This chapter presents an ecosystem-based framework for applying soil microbiology, ecology, and biochemistry (SMEB) principles and processes to address the preservation and sustainability of global soils to meet societal needs in the face of environmental change. The approach is organized around the UN Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on ecosystem services provided by soil microbes and soil biota at the nexus of food, water, and energy. The role of soil biota in ecosystem processes and the impacts of human activities on those processes are presented. The approach promotes conservation and regenerative methods that manage natural SMEB processes to optimize ecosystem services and minimize alterations in natural processes. Adoption and application of sound SMEB science will require a high degree of literacy among different stakeholders to codevelop management practices and regulatory policy. The approach also advocates promoting SMEB science literacy within the education system through reforms in science standards and curricula."
SEAMAN2023591,19 - The Insight Engine 2.0: the body and biomimetic systems as intelligent environments,"The body as an intelligent environment, nested within the larger environment of the natural and man-made world, is discussed. A linked set of embodied processes, where cognition is enacted is articulated. Extended intelligence technologies, interaction with other humans and embodied experience points to sentience in humans as being socially and linguistically framed. Sentience abstraction is used to define a model for Neosentience, a branch of AI exploring synthetic sentience via biomimetics—the reembodiment of the functional entailment structures enabling human sentience to arise. A transdisciplinary database, intelligent search engine (I_E), and a series of visualization strategies are discussed, enabling advanced transdisciplinary research. A new form of bioalgorithm to empower the arising of Neosentience is one goal. The ethics of AI and a series of other research topic areas are articulated. A repurposing of the author's Insight Engine 2.0 into a new version for the development of advanced systems for a healthy environment becomes future research."
ULFERTBLANK2022104626,Assessing digital self-efficacy: Review and scale development,"Today, digitalization is affecting all areas of life, such as education or work. The competent use of digital systems (esp. information and communication technologies [ICT]) has thus become an essential skill. Despite longstanding research on human-technology interaction and diverse theoretical approaches describing competences for interacting with digital systems, research still offers mixed results regarding the structure of digital competences. Self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. Yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness. The present study aims at providing a systematic overview and comparison of existing measures of digital self-efficacy (DSE) to current theoretical digital competence frameworks. Further, we present a newly developed scale that assesses digital self-efficacy in heterogeneous adult populations, theoretically founded in the DigComp 2.1 and social-cognition theory. The factorial structure of the DSE scale is assessed to investigate multidimensionality. Further, the scale is validated considering the nomological network (actual ICT use, technophobia). Implications for research and practice are discussed."

JIANG2022102058,How do mathematics interest and self-efficacy influence coding interest and self-efficacy? A structural equation modeling analysis,"Coding is a highly valued skill used in many disciplines across the globe. However, it is reported that students’ coding interest and self-efficacy are usually low. Theoretically, the affective domain of coding is in its infancy, and very few studies have set out to identify the determinants of coding interest and self-efficacy. This study explored how mathematics interest and self-efficacy, as two important mathematics-related factors, influenced coding interest and self-efficacy. Employing a quantitative cross-sectional survey design, 605 students from two public senior high schools in two big cities in China were investigated. A two-step structural equation modeling approach was adopted to analyze the data. Findings showed that mathematics interest, directly and indirectly, influenced coding interest significantly. In addition, coding self-efficacy was indirectly impacted by mathematics interest and coding interest was indirectly impacted by mathematics self-efficacy significantly. Most importantly, our model has proved to be powerful in explaining coding interest. This study contributes to the theoretical and practical understanding of the relationship between mathematics and coding attitudes, seldom explored in senior high school settings."
SHAH2023100040,The influences of computer gameplay and social media use on computer science identity and computer science career interests,"Computer gameplay and social media are the two most common forms of entertainment in the digital age. Many scholars share the assumption that leisure-time digital consumption is associated with computer science (CS) affinity, but there is a dearth of research evidence for this relationship. Female students generally spend less time on gaming and more time on social media than do male students, so a gender comparison perspective is helpful. Using multinomial logistic regression analysis on a national sample of 10,197 U.S. college students in introductory CS courses, we found that frequent computer gameplay was strongly associated with an increase in the probability of CS career interest relative to a Non-STEM career interest (β = -0.17, se = 0.06, p < .01) for both male (N = 7214) and female students (N = 2659). In contrast, increased social media use predicted a higher CS career interest relative to a Science/Engineering career interest (β = 0.12, se = 0.06, p < .05) for female students by 8%, however, a lower interest for male students by 4%."
VELDHUIS2025100708,Critical Artificial Intelligence literacy: A scoping review and framework synthesis,"The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday life raises concerns for children, other marginalized groups, and the general public. As new AI implementations continue to emerge, it is crucial to enable children to engage critically with AI. Critical literacy objectives and practices can encourage children to question, critique, and transform the social, political, cultural, and ethical implications of AI. As an initial step towards critical AI education, we conducted a 10-year scoping review to identify publications reporting on activities that engage children, between the ages of 5 and 18, to address the critical implications of AI. Our review identifies a wide range of participants, content, and pedagogical approaches. Through framework synthesis guided by an established critical literacy model, we examine the critical literacy learning objectives embedded in the reported activities and propose a critical AI literacy framework. This paper outlines future opportunities for critical AI literacies in the field of child–computer interaction including inspiring new learning activities, encouraging inclusive perspectives, and supporting pragmatic curriculum integration."

HELBING2023102061,"Democracy by Design: Perspectives for Digitally Assisted, Participatory Upgrades of Society","The technological revolution, particularly the availability of more data and more powerful computational tools, has led to the emergence of a new scientific field called “Computational Diplomacy”. Our work tries to define its scope and focuses on a popular subarea of it, namely “Digital Democracy”. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using digital technologies to promote more participatory forms of democracy. While there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. It is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. This paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies. We argue that more research on how digital technologies can be used to support democracy upgrade is needed. Along these lines, we lay out a research agenda for the future."
LOUSTAU2022100544,Characterizing the research-practice gap in children’s interactive storytelling systems,"Storytelling support has been and continues to be a recurring theme in child–computer interaction research, especially as it pertains to education. This work has spilled over into practice, and, in the last few decades, a large number of storytelling systems for children have been developed—both as research prototypes and commercial applications. However, through a systematic analysis of 75 research-based storytelling systems and 39 commercial systems, we find that there remains a problematic gap between research and practice with respect to products in interactive storytelling and child–computer interaction, echoing the well-documented research-practice gap in the general HCI field. We characterize the nature of this gap, highlighting design themes promoted by research-based systems that are not as prevalent in commercial systems, such as tangibility and narrative scaffolds, and vice-versa. Understanding the main areas of discrepancy between research and practice can help focus efforts to close the research-practice gap in storytelling systems for children."
LIANG2023104827,A robot-based digital storytelling approach to enhancing EFL learners’ multimodal storytelling ability and narrative engagement,"Digital technology has brought new opportunities for language education. Multimodal literacy refers to the ability to read, watch, understand, respond to, and generate multimodal texts. Multimodality, promoted by scholars, generates meaning in multiple modes. Hence, digital storytelling (DST) presented with multimodal content has been extensively applied in second language instruction. However, traditional DST is mostly presented in videos with one-way communication; it lacks two-way communication with the audience and is only regarded as a learning method for knowledge acquisition. As a result, the present study proposed a robot-based DST (robot-DST) approach to facilitate the interaction in the DST process and to enhance students' engagement. In order to evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an EFL course at a senior high school. Two classes of 11th graders participated in the experiment. One class with 40 students was the experimental group adopting the robot-DST approach, while the other class with 40 students was the control group adopting the conventional animation-based DST (CA-DST) approach. The results showed that the robot-DST approach could significantly reduce students' communication apprehension, as well as enhance their English speaking ability, storytelling ability, narrative engagement, and communication tendency. The findings show that using robots in the context of digital storytelling design has great potential for promoting learners’ language learning performances. Accordingly, in-depth discussion and suggestions for future research are provided for researchers and school teachers who intend to use robots in educational settings."
KHALAJZADEH2025107570,Accessibility of low-code approaches: A systematic literature review,"Context:
Model-driven approaches are increasingly used in different domains, such as education, finance and app development, in order to involve non-developers in the software development process.

Objectives:
To locate and analyse existing literature on the accessibility of low-code approaches, their strengths and weaknesses and key directions for future research.
Methods:
We carried out a systematic literature review and searched through five leading databases for primary studies. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods for data synthesis.
Results:
After reviewing and filtering 918 located studies, and conducting both backward and forward snowballing, we identified 38 primary studies that were included in our analysis. We found most papers focusing on accessibility of visual languages and block-based programming.
Conclusion:
Limited work has been done on improving low code programming environment accessibility. The findings of this systematic literature review will assist researchers and developers in understanding the accessibility issues in low-code approaches and what has been done so far to develop accessible approaches."
SOSAREYES2022676,"Interdisciplinary approaches to the teaching of forensic science in the Forensic Science Undergraduate Program of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, before and after COVID-19","In 2013, the Forensic Science Undergraduate Program (FSUP) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico was created in response to an alarming criminal situation in Mexico, as well as to the radical reform of its criminal justice system. Its mission is to educate and train ethical, critical, and humanistic forensic scientists capable of conducting inquiries that meet scientific quality standards and assist the justice system in firmly linking legal rulings to the available evidence. At the time, it was the first such program in the country, and the contributions that interdisciplinary forensic scientists could make to criminal investigations were largely unknown among forensic and legal practitioners. During its existence, providing an interdisciplinary, competence-based education to students has been one of the main challenges. To overcome it, teaching and assessment approaches—centered on the achievement of specifically forensic competencies as learning outcomes and the integration of forensic disciplines towards the resolution of simulated cases—have been devised to help develop the professional skill set expected of graduates. The COVID-19 pandemic led to adapting these approaches to distance or hybrid modes of learning, increasing their versatility and enriching the pedagogic repertoire of the FSUP. Currently, the main impact of the program lies in the successful incorporation of some of its graduates to agencies belonging to or related to the criminal justice system, such as the National Prosecutor’s Office, the Commission for Truth and Justice for the Ayotzinapa Case, and the National Commission for the Search of Missing and Disappeared Persons, among others."
LEECULTURA2022100355,Children’s play and problem-solving in motion-based learning technologies using a multi-modal mixed methods approach,"Motion-Based Learning Technologies (MBLT) offer a promising approach for integrating play and problem-solving behaviour within children’s learning. The proliferation of sensor technology has driven the field of learning technology towards the development of tools and methods that may benefit from the produced Multi-Modal Data (MMD). Such data can be used to uncover cognitive, affective and physiological processes during learning activities. Combining MMD with more traditionally exercised assessment tools, such as video content analysis, provides a more holistic understanding of children’s learning experiences and has the potential to enable the design of educational technologies capable of harmonising children’s cognitive, affective and physiological processes, while promoting appropriately balanced play and problem-solving efforts. However, the use of an MMD mixed methods approach that combines qualitative and MMD data to understand children’s behaviours during engagement with MBLT is rather unexplored. We present an in-situ study where 26 children, ages 10–12, solved a motion-based sorting task for learning geometry. We continuously and unobtrusively monitored children’s learning experiences using MMD collection via eye-trackers, wristbands, Kinect joint tracking, and a web camera. We devised SP3, a novel observational scheme that can be used to understand children’s solo interactions with MBLT, and applied it to identify and extract children’s evoked play and problem-solving behaviour. Collective analysis of the MMD and video codes provided explanations of children’s task performance through consideration of their holistic learning experience. Lastly, we applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between various MMD measurements and children’s play and problem-solving behaviours. This research sheds light on the opportunities offered in the confluence of video coding (a traditional method in learning sciences) and MMD (an emerging method that leverages sensors proliferation) for investigating children’s behaviour with MBLT."

WANG2021157,Chapter 5 - Battery state-of-charge estimation methods,"With the large-scale promotion of new energy vehicles, the demand for power batteries such as the lithium-ion type has increased. Its service lifespan is closely related to the service condition. The important embodiment of the service condition is the battery state of charge, which can reflect its residual capacity. Through accurate residual capacity, the battery application strategy can be planned to realize the battery operation of the best condition. The long service lifespan can be realized by adjusting the voltage and current. Therefore, real-time accurate state estimation has a significant effect on battery management. The extended Kalman filtering algorithm is introduced to estimate the state value under complex working conditions. The overview of the state-of-charge estimation is first conducted. After that, the equivalent modeling construction method is explored. The coordinate transformation treatment is implemented in the binary iterative calculation algorithm, according to which the algorithm is implemented. In the extended calculation process, the iterative prediction and correction strategies are introduced into the test. Consequently, the pulse-power characteristic test is conducted to obtain the estimation features, considering a thermal influencing effect, a time-varying current condition, and a complex current rate verification."
PAYDAR2023165,Chapter 3 - Nuclear power reactions driven radiation hardening environments,"Radiation hardening, also known as “rad hardening,” and radiation survivability testing are of critical importance to defense, aerospace, and energy industries. Everyone knows that excessive exposure to radiation can cause severe damage to living things, but high radiation levels can also cause radiation damage to other objects, especially electronics. Ionizing radiation in particular, including directly ionizing radiation such as alpha and beta particles and indirectly ionizing radiation such as gamma rays and neutron radiation, is profoundly damaging to the semiconductors that make up the backbone of all modern electronics. Just one charged particle can interfere with thousands of electrons, causing signal noise, disrupting digital circuits, and even causing permanent physical radiation damage. Radiation hardening involves designing radiation-tolerant electronics and components that are tolerant of the massive levels of ionizing radiation, such as cosmic outer space radiation, X-ray radiation in medical or security environments, and high energy radiation within nuclear power plants. In order to test these components and determine whether they are sufficiently hardened, radiation-hardened electronics manufacturers perform rigorous testing as part of their product manufacturing processes. Components which pass these tests go into production and can be described as “radiation-hardened”; components that do not go back to design."
BARFAR2021113442,Peak cubes in service operations: Bringing multidimensionality into decision support systems,"Companies like Ritz Carlton, Disney and Verizon are among many who have invested in analytics to improve their customers' service experiences with the firms. Extensive data are collected on all aspects of how customers interact or experience the products or services. Research has shown the importance of the “peak-end” rule in service design; that is, providing a customer with good “peak” service levels and “ending” the service experience with high quality can enhance customer satisfaction and build loyalty. However, previous studies have examined this phenomenon only in contexts with unidimensional service levels. We introduce peak cubes, which enable service designers and scholars to pinpoint prominent service levels in multidimensional service experience profiles—thereby extending current research on behavioral economics and service design to more general settings. Results indicate the potential of multidimensional peak-end models to better predict customer satisfaction in various service scenarios. Using Shapley values in coalitional game theory, the resulting models can also inform service designers about the quality dimensions that are critical from the perspective of multidimensional peak-end heuristic and customer satisfaction. Our research contributions and proposed methodology will enhance decision support systems with multidimensional capabilities and have applications to fields as diverse as service operations and healthcare."
MEYER202013,Changing Design Education for the 21st Century,"Designers are entrusted with increasingly complex and impactful challenges. However, the current system of design education does not always prepare students for these challenges. When we examine what and how our system teaches young designers, we discover that the most valuable elements of the designer’s perspective and process are seldom taught. Instead, some designers grow beyond their education through their experience working in industry, essentially learning by accident. Many design programs still maintain an insular perspective and an inefficient mechanism of tacit knowledge transfer. Meanwhile, skills for developing creative solutions to complex problems are increasingly essential. Organizations are starting to recognize that designers bring something special to this type of work, a rational belief based upon numerous studies that link commercial success to a design-driven approach. So, what are we to do? Other learned professions such as medicine, law, and business provide excellent advice and guidance embedded within their own histories of professionalization. In this article, we borrow from their experiences to recommend a course of action for design. It will not be easy: it will require a study group to make recommendations for a roster of design and educational practices that schools can use to build a curriculum that matches their goals and abilities. And then it will require a conscious effort to bootstrap the design profession toward both a robust practitioner community and an effective professoriate, capable together of fully realizing the value of design in the 21st century. In this article, we lay out that path."
HAMILTON2023371,Chapter 16 - Natural Language Processing,"Sensory evaluation is predicated on the use and interpretation of human language. We ask our subjects to describe their sensory experiences and affective responses, which we cannot directly observe. This formulation of sensory science encourages direct engagement with linguistics and in particular, a recent subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence called “Natural Language Processing” (NLP, sometimes “computational linguistics”). In this chapter we will provide an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sensory scientists who wish to employ NLP as a rapid method for sensory evaluation. Because NLP is a large, diverse, and rapidly evolving field, we will begin with a brief, pragmatic overview of the discipline, with an emphasis on key historical and current methods and applications. We will then briefly discuss the linguistic perspective and its application to sensory evaluation, with an aim to motivating the remaining chapter. Following that, we will discuss key areas of NLP, from data collection to processing to analysis to advanced applications. Throughout the chapter, we will use a consistent case study of natural-language descriptions for a food product to provide examples and illustrate NLP methods."
CHEN2021100379,Conceptualization and measurement of digital citizenship across disciplines,"A corollary to the exponential growth of digital technology is the increase in research interest in the construct of digital citizenship (DC) in diverse disciplinary areas. Although the term DC is used widely in research, scholars do not commit to a common definition. This integrative review investigates the conceptualizations and measurements of DC, across disciplines, in the extant literature. A systematic search of 11 databases identified a total of 350 unique items that contain “digital citizenship” in the title or keywords published by December 2018, with the majority published after 2010. Of these, 114 were peer-reviewed journal articles published in a wide range of discipline-specific venues, more than half of which were education-related. In-depth analyses show that each of the dominant conceptualizations of DC has been adopted by different disciplines, albeit with different popularities in adoption. Findings also revealed widely shared stakeholder concerns and research foci in DC research across the disciplines. However, there is a stark lack of empirical research on the young children, and an absence of commonly deployed research instruments in DC-related research. The present integrative review implicates the need for interdisciplinary collaboration for significant advances in DC research to address issues in policy and practice."
GUERRAMACIAS2025e41099,"Development of transversal skills in higher education programs in conjunction with online learning: relationship between learning strategies, project-based pedagogical practices, e-learning platforms, and academic performance","This study investigates the development of transversal skills and their association with academic performance in university students enrolled in on-campus programs with online activities. A cross-sectional, descriptive, and quantitative research was conducted with 252 students from a public university in Mexico. Transversal skills, socioformative project-based practices, learning strategies, and the relevance of online activities were assessed using validated rubrics. The results indicated a low level of development in three transversal skills: research, entrepreneurship, and English, with the latter being the poorest rated. Critical and creative thinking exhibited the highest level of development. In the didactic component, socioformative project-based pedagogical practices and learning strategies showed acceptable levels. Students expressed satisfaction with complementary online activities, showing a preference for interactive videos and short videos under 4 min. Regression analysis and structural equations were used to examine the relationships between various factors. Results demonstrated that socioformative project-based pedagogical practices, learning strategies, and online education positively correlated with the development of transversal skills. Furthermore, a higher level of transversal skills was associated with better academic averages among students. Socioformative project-based pedagogical practices also correlated with academic performance through transversal skills. The study concludes that integrating online activities into on-campus programs, based on the socioformative pedagogical model, can enhance the development of transversal skills and improve academic performance. Further research into the implementation of this educational model and its long-term impact on university education and professional success is recommended."
SALAJ2024298,Competencies for Smart City Challenges,"It is acknowledged that technological innovation is needed in all sectors to cope with new demands. From social innovations, it introduces novel ideas, whether products, services, or models, to fulfil societal needs and foster new partnerships or collaborations. The aim is to enhance social interactions and elevate human well-being. Development of cutting-edge digital technologies is reality. The challenge is on human resource side, how quickly we can prepare employees to adapt to the requirements of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. In the paper, the new competencies were identified with the business stakeholders by conducting a survey among industry partners to recognize the requirements for the future labor market. The stakeholders in the construction field act as target groups for monitoring and development of the competencies. The focus of the result part is on the competencies companies mostly miss from their employees from digital perspectives, e.g. reason to hire highly educated people, training possibilities for digitally upskilling employees, lacking appropriate competencies (critical thinking, systems and analytical thinking, information management, advanced computer/IT skills (AI), ensuring security).

It is highly important to consider the job market needs for development and to adopt the engineering education system to be responsive to the needs of labor market."
NASIR2022100093,Temporal pathways to learning: How learning emerges in an open-ended collaborative activity.,"The learning process depends on the nature of the learning environment, particularly in the case of open-ended learning environments, where the learning process is considered to be non-linear. In this paper, we report on the findings of employing a multimodal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methodology to investigate the temporal learning processes of two types of learners that have learning gains and a type that does not have learning gains in an open-ended collaborative learning activity. Considering log data, speech behavior, affective states and gaze patterns, we find that all learners start from a similar state of non-productivity, but once out of it they are unlikely to fall back into that state, especially in the case of the learners that have learning gains. Those who have learning gains shift between two problem solving strategies, each characterized by both exploratory and reflective actions, as well as demonstrate speech and gaze patterns associated with these strategies, that differ from those who don't have learning gains. Further, the teams that have learning gains also differ between themselves in the manner in which they employ the problem solving strategies over the interaction, as well as in the manner they express negative emotions while exhibiting a particular strategy. These outcomes contribute to understanding the multiple pathways of learning in an open-ended collaborative learning environment, and provide actionable insights for designing effective interventions."
TAN2020101793,A graph-theoretic approach for the detection of phishing webpages,"Over the years, various technical means have been developed to protect Internet users from phishing attacks. To enrich the anti-phishing efforts, we capitalise on concepts from graph theories, and propose a set of novel graph features to improve the phishing detection accuracy. The initial phase of the proposed technique involved the extraction of hyperlinks in the webpage under scrutiny and fetching the corresponding neighbourhood webpages. During this process, the page linking data were collected, and used to construct a web graph which models the overall hyperlink and network structure of the webpage. From the web graph, graph measures were computed and extracted as graph features to derive a classifier for detecting phishing webpages. Experimental results show that the proposed graph features achieve an improved overall accuracy of 97.8% when C4.5 was utilised as classifier, outperforming the existing conventional features derived from the same data samples. Unlike conventional features, the proposed graph features leverage inherent phishing patterns that are only visible at a higher level of abstraction, thus making it robust and difficult to be evaded by direct manipulations on the webpage contents. Our proposed graph-based technique also shows promising results when benchmarked against a prominent phishing detection technique. Hence, the proposed technique is an important contribution to the existing anti-phishing research towards improving the detection performance."
CHANG2022104641,Ten years of augmented reality in education: A meta-analysis of (quasi-) experimental studies to investigate the impact,"Augmented reality (AR) continues to show its impact in education. While systematic review and meta-analysis studies have synthesized the evidence of this impact, most of them did not differentiate how AR may foster various learning outcomes to different degrees. In this study, 134 (quasi-)experimental studies on augmented reality (AR) in education from 2012 to 2021 were reviewed to discern the impact of AR on three levels of learning outcomes, namely response, knowledge and skill, and performance. The 134 studies are the data of this study for meta-analysis, which were obtained following the procedure of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis. Moreover, meta-regression was employed to investigate important factors relating to the variation of the impact, including educational level, subject area, treatment duration, and AR affordance. Findings from the meta-analysis suggest that AR technology has benefited all three learning outcomes, with a larger mean effect size on the outcome of performance. Furthermore, the meta-regression results indicate treatment duration as a significant factor likely relating to the variation in the impact of AR in education. Moreover, AR used to support the learning of languages or social studies is likely associated with higher positive learner responses such as learning motivation or attitude than AR used for science learning. The meta-regression result indicated that use of 3-D visualization in AR needs to be carefully designed and evaluated. The implications of using AR to support learning, the design of AR learning environments, and the future direction of research are discussed."

GAJDZIK202268,Smart Production Workers in Terms of Creativity and Innovation: The Implication for Open Innovation,"ABSTRACT
This paper presents a framework of employee skills and competencies useful for developing occupational profiles for employees of companies transitioning towards Industry 4.0. The paper consists of a discussion of the theoretical and practical parts of case studies. The theoretical portion was created on the basis of a review of scientific literature and research studies regarding the competencies and skills of employees in the ongoing fourth industrial revolution. This part focuses on the skills profile of an Industry 4.0 employee and an Operator 4.0 (O4.0) from a creativity and innovativeness point of view. The link between the theoretical part and the case study analysis was a general framework for building the competencies and skills of the steelworker in the emerging fourth industrial revolution. The case study analysis covered the framework of competencies and skills of a metallurgist in smart manufacturing built into the organization of steel mills. Recruitment offers of a steel company implementing smart manufacturing (SM) projects and educational programmes of technical universities in the field of metallurgy were analysed. The aim of the study was to develop a framework for the profile of an employee working in an innovative company transforming to I4.0. The publication posed the following research questions (purposes/hypotheses): P1. To what extent do Polish companies in the metallurgical sector pay attention to creativity and innovation issues when looking for employees? P2. To what extent do the profile (portfolio) of metallurgy graduates of Polish technical universities turn their attention to the issues related to creativity and innovation?"
ROBSON2022101018,Searching for the principles of a less artificial A.I.,"What would it take to build a computer physician that can take its place amongst human peers? Currently, Neural Nets, especially as so-called “Deep Learning” nets, dominate what is popularly called “Artificial Intelligence”, but to many critics they seem to be little more than powerful data-analytic tools inspired by some of the more basic functions and regions of the human brain such as those involved in early processes in biological vision, classification, and categorization. The deeper nature of human intelligence as the term is normally meant, including relating to consciousness, has been the domain of philosophers, psychologists, and some neuroscientists. Now, attention is turning to neuronal mechanisms in humans and simpler organisms as a basis of a truer AI with far greater potential. Arguably, the approach required should be rooted in information theory and algorithmic science. But as discussed in this paper, caution is required: “just any old information” might not do. The information might need to be of a particular dynamical and actioning nature, and that might significantly impact the kind of computation and computer hardware required. Overall, however, the authors do not favor emergent properties such as those based on complexity and quantum effects. Despite the possible difficulties, such studies could, in return, have substantial benefits for biology and medicine beyond the computational tools that they produce to serve those disciplines."
STRAWHACKER2020100212,Designing with Genes in Early Childhood: An exploratory user study of the tangible CRISPEE technology,"Biodesign, a speculative and creative offshoot from the field of bioengineering, is an area of STEM that is growing in popularity in education settings, primarily because of its unique interdisciplinary lens that connects STEM disciplinary knowledge and creative design practices. Although this trend is currently limited to middle school, high school, and higher education, prior research suggests that children 5 years and older, may yield long-term gains from exploring developmentally-appropriate concepts from novel STEM fields. Although there is little research on educational technologies or resources to support young children’s curiosity and learning in this novel domain, some research suggests that young children may already be forming preconceptions about genetics and biology (e.g., from popular media). Tangible technologies, which provide children qualitatively new, developmentally appropriate ways to engage with ideas and techniques, have been shown to support children’s engagement with foundational ideas relevant to biodesign, including the engineering design process. By applying developmentally appropriate constraints to our technology development (e.g., through frameworks such as the Positive Technological Development), the research team developed and evaluated a novel tangible technology called CRISPEE to introduce young children to concepts of biology and engineering. This article describes an experimental pilot study to investigate (1) how young children interact with the CRISPEE technological prototype, and (2) what prior knowledge the average child might bring to an educational biodesign activity. Implications for ongoing technology development and developmentally appropriate learning goals are discussed."
ROMEROORGANVIDEZ2024112029,Data visualization guidance using a software product line approach,"Data visualization aims to convey quantitative and qualitative information effectively by determining which techniques and visualizations are most appropriate for different situations and why. Various software solutions can produce numerous visualizations of the same data set. However, data visualization encompasses a wide range of visual configurations that depend on factors such as the type of data being displayed, the different displays (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs, and pie charts), the visual components used to represent the data (e.g., lines, dots, and bars), and the specific visual attributes of those components (e.g., color, shape, size, and length). A similar problem arises when designing data tables, where the dimensionality of the data and its complexity influence the choice of the most appropriate structure (e.g., unidirectional, bidirectional). Often, this broad spectrum of configurations requires a visualization expert who knows which techniques are best for which type of data source and what is to be conveyed. Typically, researchers and developers lack knowledge of data visualization best practices and must learn the design principles that enable effective communication and the technical details of the specific software tool they use to generate visualizations. This paper proposes a software product line approach to model and realize the variability of the visualization design process, using feature models to encode knowledge about design best practices in graphs and charts. Our approach involves solving visualization design variability through a stepwise configuration process and evaluating the proposal for a specific software visualization tool. Our solution facilitates effective communication of quantitative results by helping researchers and developers select and generate the most effective visualizations for each case. This approach opens up new opportunities for research at the intersection of data visualization and variability."
ZARESTKY2022100085,Reflective Writing Supports Metacognition and Self-regulation in Graduate Computational Science and Engineering,"Computational Science and Engineering (CS&E) is a relatively new discipline for which no consensus exists on how classes should best be taught. Many CS&E courses are compressed add-ons to existing programs and, consequently, must cover a breadth of topics encompassing modules from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and application disciplines. Additionally, these courses would benefit from embedded 21st century skills, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and lifelong learning behaviors, but such skills are often neglected in course design even though the education and workforce literature are clear about their importance for future careers. The breadth and complexity in course design necessary to incorporate all of these components create a challenge for instructors and students. In this interpretive study, we investigate student experiences and perceived outcomes in a technology-mediated graduate-level CS&E course designed to address the difficulties associated with this wide range of disciplinary topics and professional skills. Our course design is based on reflective practice and principles of metacognition, and applies elements such as a flipped classroom, student journals, and reflective writing exercises; these design goals directly support students’ metacognition and foster self-regulated learning behaviors that, in turn, develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. We evaluate this design using student reflective writing and surveys. Results indicate reflective writing activities in course design helped develop students’ metacognitive awareness, self-regulated learning behaviors, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. This course design can serve as a template for others teaching technology-mediated courses in CS&E and related areas, and aiming to develop students’ 21st century professional skills."
MARCU2022,Barriers and Considerations in the Design and Implementation of Digital Behavioral Interventions: Qualitative Analysis,"Background
Digital behavioral interventions have become increasingly popular for their ability to support patient diagnosis and treatment, chronic disease self-management, behavior change, and adherence to recommended care. However, digital intervention development is impeded by challenges such as limited technical skills, limited access to developers, and cost. The purpose of this study is to elicit in-depth qualitative feedback from intervention developers who have interest in digital behavioral interventions but lack programming skills regarding the barriers they experience and key considerations in the design and implementation of digital interventions.
Objective
This study aims to understand barriers in the design and implementation of digital behavioral interventions, as well as to identify key considerations for researchers who are developing these interventions.
Methods
We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 18 researchers who had experience either designing (but not coding) digital behavioral interventions or running research studies with them. Participants were a convenience sample of users of the Computerized Intervention Authoring System platform, an existing no-code development platform for building digital intervention content, and were recruited through either direct email solicitation or snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted and recorded over videoconference between February and April 2020. Recordings from interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed by multiple coders.
Results
Interviews were completed with 18 participants and lasted between 24 and 65 (mean 46.9, SD 11.3) minutes. Interviewees were predominantly female (17/18, 94%) and represented different job roles, ranging from researcher to project/study staff. Three key barriers in the development of digital behavior interventions were identified during interviews: lack of cross-disciplinary understanding; variability in recipients’ technology access, infrastructure, and literacy; and the idea that evidence-based in-person interactions do not translate directly to digital interactions. Interviewees identified several key considerations that interventionists learned to prioritize, which have the potential to overcome these barriers and lead to successful interventions.
Conclusions
Barriers in the development of digital behavioral interventions are often created by a lack of cross-disciplinary understanding, which can lead to difficulties conceptualizing interventions, unrealistic expectations in terms of cost, and confusion about the development process. Moreover, concerns about research study participant characteristics and access to technology, as well as the translation of in-person interventions to digital, are apparent. Appropriate training in how to work with software development teams may help future digital behavior intervention creators overcome these barriers and may lead to new, exciting innovations in this space."
ALDAAJEH2022102754,The role of national cybersecurity strategies on the improvement of cybersecurity education,"Digital information and telecommunication technologies have not only become essential to individuals’ daily lives but also to a nation’s sustained economic growth, societal well-being, critical infrastructure resilience, and national security. Consequently, the protection of a nation’s cyber sovereignty from malicious acts is a major concern. This signifies the importance of cybersecurity education in facilitating the creation of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem and in supporting cyber sovereignty. This study reviews a sample from world-leading countries National Cybersecurity Strategic Plans (NCSPs) and analyzes the associated existing cybersecurity education and training improvement initiatives. Furthermore, a proposal to adopt the Goal-Question-Outcomes(GQO)+Strategies paradigm into cybersecurity education and training programs curricula improvement to national cybersecurity strategic goals is presented. The proposal maps cybersecurity strategic goals to cybersecurity skills and competencies using the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework. The newly proposed cybersecurity education and training programs’ curricula learning outcomes were generated from the GQO+Strategies paradigm based on the three major cybersecurity strategic goals: Development of secure digital and information technology infrastructure and services, defending from sophisticated cyber threats, and enrichment of individuals’ cybersecurity maturity and awareness. It is highly recommended that cybersecurity university program administrators utilize the proposed GQO+Strategies to align their program’s curriculum to NCSP. Hence, closing the gap that exists with the relevant skills and sustain national cybersecurity workforces."
PARHI2022108062,Factors affecting Industry 4.0 adoption – A hybrid SEM-ANN approach,"Industry 4.0 is a technology-driven digital transformation to enable data-driven decision-making based on real-time data to enhance the competitiveness of traditional manufacturing. Moving forward, adopting Industry 4.0 is an evident requirement for manufacturers to remain competitive. Currently, in the early stages of adoption in most industries and countries, there is an evident lack of foundational Industry 4.0 knowledge among decision-makers. There are few studies on the adoption of Industry 4.0; however, they focus on specific domains like cloud computing, virtual reality, IoT, etc., and are primarily set in developed countries. This research proposes a multi-stage hybrid analytic approach whereby the research model was tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The SEM results were used as inputs for the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to determine significant predictors for the adoption of Industry 4.0 in Indian manufacturing industries. A comprehensive sample of 350 responses from various Indian manufacturers was collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the factors viz. Software Infrastructure (SI), System Flexibility (SF), Operational Accuracy (OA), and the Technical Capabilities (TC) play a dominant role in the successful adoption intentions of Industry 4.0 in India. Manufacturers from India and other emerging economies will benefit from the findings of this study by concentrating and improving on the dominant adoption factors of Industry 4.0. Concluding, we discuss the study’s results and derive lessons learned for stakeholders, including managers, consultants, policymakers, and regulatory authorities."
MOHDAMINUDDIN2023103582,The rise of website fingerprinting on Tor: Analysis on techniques and assumptions,"Tor is one of the most popular anonymity networks that allows Internet users to hide their browsing activity. Hiding browsing activity is essential for Internet users to increase their privacy. Only Tor users should know the website they are browsing. However, an attacker can utilise the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack to identify webpages browsed by Tor users. WF is a significant threat to Internet users' privacy as Tor should conceal the browsed webpages' information. Existing WF studies focused on the investigation to improve the identification capabilities, overlooking the systematic discussion and assessment of existing techniques. In addition, existing surveys and analyses reviewed insufficient variation of WF on Tor techniques. Therefore, this survey paper aims to provide a systematic and thorough review of various WF on Tor techniques. First, we discuss WF on Tor techniques in five primary aspects: threat model, victim target, website realm, traffic feature, and traffic classifier. We analyse and classify the reviewed studies on each WF aspect. The classification facilitates in-depth understanding and comparison between WF on Tor techniques. Furthermore, this paper investigates nine assumptions exercised in WF on Tor: closed-world, sequential browsing, isolated traffic, replicability, traffic parsing, passive webpage, disabled cache, static content, and single webpage. These assumptions limit the WF on Tor's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our analysis and classification indicate that most WF on Tor studies apply these assumptions despite being only suitable in controlled environments or laboratory experiments. In addition, most reviewed studies often lack transparency on the assumptions exercised in their studies, risking misunderstanding the WF on Tor techniques' actual practicality. At the end of this survey, we present WF on Tor taxonomy and highlight 21 WF on Tor research's limitations and gaps with plausible recommendations. We also discuss the WF on Tor studies' contribution category and development phase."
CUEVAS2025147,7 - Basic models,"In this chapter, we will delve into the art of constructing agent-based models (Helbing, 2012). Agent-based modeling is a powerful and versatile tool that allows us to simulate complex systems by representing individual agents and their interactions within a given environment. Here, we will take a step-by-step approach, starting with classic models and gradually moving toward creating customized versions. By understanding how these models work and learning how to modify and extend them, we will gain valuable insights into alternative scenarios and even uncover entirely new phenomena."
FRECHETTE2021137,Executive control in dual language learning preschoolers: The association between Hot and cool executive control and science achievement,"The number of Dual Language Learners (DLLs) in the United States is rapidly increasing, with over 25% of the preschoolers speaking a language other than English at home leading to a need to examine skills that contribute to their achievement. Executive Control (EC), or the ability to regulate attention, affect, and behavior effectively, is one skill that is particularly important for preschool children to develop. EC has been examined for monolingual children as a single construct, and as two related constructs, Cool Executive Control (CEC) and Hot Executive Control (HEC), and is associated with later academic outcomes. The purpose of this study was to extend the EC research to DLL preschoolers, determine if EC is a one or two factor construct in a sample of DLLs, and examine if the construct relates to DLL children’s science achievement. Structural equation modeling was used with a sample of 181 DLL children enrolled in Head Start. In line with previous research on monolingual Head Start children, EC emerged as two distinct latent factors, CEC and HEC. This study also examined the association between concurrent CEC, HEC, and science achievement. CEC was positively associated with DLLs’ science achievement, whereas HEC was not. These findings stress the importance of measuring the two dimensions of DLLs’ EC separately as they differentially relate to science achievement."
ZHANG2024e24168,Mapping the educational Frontier: Unleashing the Potential of artificial intelligence talents through cooperative planning in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao greater bay area,"The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has become an important hub for technological innovation and economic development in China. With the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technology talents, it is essential to develop educational cooperation within the GBA to develop a talent pool that can meet the changing needs in the region. This paper focuses on the development of dynamic demand for AI talents and proposes a strategic planning framework for educational cooperation in the GBA. We use the research idea of common attributes and key chain clustering-factor association selection-analysis of the driving force and subordination among factors-the key characteristics of AI talents. Using collinear analysis of citations and grounded theory methods, an operational definition of the influencing factors of AI talent literacy characteristics is constructed. Using the Interpretative Structural Modeling(ISM) and MICMAC (Matrice d’Impacts Croises-Multipication Applique A Classement), analyze and identify the driving force and subordination of the influencing factors of key traits of talents, and present the combined effect of multi-level factors of key traits of talents. Combined with the educational differences and complementary advantages in the GBA, five strategies and seven implementation suggestions for the GBA's AI talent education cooperation plan are formulated to establish a collaborative ecosystem that promotes the growth and integration of AI in the GBA."
PIWOWARSULEJ2021124008,Human resources development as an element of sustainable HRM – with the focus on production engineers,"The concept of sustainability has been gaining importance and influencing the development of an approach towards employees referred to as sustainable HRM (SHRM). HR development is one of the principles of SHRM that should be implemented consistently along with other SHRM principles, which means, e.g., that the development of employees should be carried out having a long-term perspective in mind. It is crucial to acquire the so-called competencies of the future as the basis for implementing the idea of Industry 4.0. The purpose of the article is to present the development of human potential in an organization against the background of other detailed sustainable HRM principles, to be followed by confronting the theory and the research results on the development of future competencies referring to industrial engineers in Poland as the professional group responsible for implementing the idea of cleaner production and Industry 4.0. The Author analyzed the results of three research projects based on the survey method and representative data from Eurostat and Statistics Poland. The conducted research shows that industrial companies in Poland have more of a short-sighted perspective when it comes to developing the potential of their engineers. The HR development practices focusing only on current needs are not in line with the SHRM principles of a long-term perspective and flexibility. There is also a visible lack of employee participation in the process of making training-related decisions, which is another principle of sustainable HRM. In addition, environmental sustainability remains a neglected area of knowledge in terms of training, and the cooperation with external educational institutions is low. It results in certain implications for HR managers and educational institutions. The article also presents directions for further research."
WAITE2020103838,Difficulties with design: The challenges of teaching design in K-5 programming,"Teachers in England are required to ensure that learners from the age of five are taught about algorithms and program design. Yet, there is evidence that despite teachers reporting that design is important, they are not converting this into classroom practice. This paper describes a survey study, in which we explored teachers’ difficulties in using design. We surveyed 207 teachers asking them free-text questions on their use of design in teaching programming and their views of pupils’ responses to using design. In the survey, we also investigated teachers’ understanding of the term algorithm, an essential concept which may be a contributing factor in their difficulties with design. We provide underpinning data on the difficulties of using design that teachers of pupils aged from 5 to 11 years old (Grades K to 5) have in teaching programming. Difficulties with design identified include pupil resistance, a lack of time, a lack of pupil and teacher expertise, conflicting pedagogical choices and a general confusion over what an algorithm is. There were statistically significant differences in selection of the term ‘algorithm’ to describe programming artefacts whether a teacher was a specialist or a generalist, what training they had received on programming or design, the age group taught and programming language used. Teachers were more likely to call a complex code snippet an ‘algorithm’ than a simpler one and more likely to select the term to describe code snippets than a design artefact. We make suggestions of how to alleviate the problems including that teachers are introduced to the idea of ambiguous representations of algorithms and a process which refines the representation from ambiguous to unambiguous as the design progresses."
ALE2022100478,A systematic survey on embodied cognition: 11 years of research in child–computer interaction,"Embodied cognition is a concept that has been extensively explored by scholars within the Child–Computer Interaction community. However, there is a lack of a synthesis of this research to clarify the field’s benefits and drawbacks. This paper presents a survey of articles published between 2010 and 2020 in the Interaction Design and Children (IDC) conference and the International Journal of Child–Computer Interaction (IJCCI). We retrieved 158 papers using the keyword ”embodied cognition” and its derivatives. Further screening narrowed these down to 43. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current landscape of ‘embodied’ research by reporting the most common subject areas of application, forms, and modes of embodiment, and the role of children and adults. Our contribution is twofold: we highlight the main trends around these themes within the field, and we provide eight critical areas of future research. By illustrating new challenges and opportunities, we aim to support the growth of this area of research within the CCI community."
ADORNI2024100466,Development of algorithmic thinking skills in K-12 education: A comparative study of unplugged and digital assessment instruments,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital competencies, the need for a robust and universal method to assess students’ algorithmic thinking (AT) skills has become increasingly pronounced. Algorithmic thinking refers to the ability to analyse a problem and develop a step-by-step process to solve it. This research investigates the efficacy of the Cross Array Task (CAT) as an assessment tool for AT skills within Switzerland’s compulsory education system. Originally conceptualised as an unplugged activity, where students performed the task without digital technologies (e.g., by using gestures on paper) and an administrator manually assessed them, the CAT evolved into a digital activity that runs on an iPad. The CAT’s digital transformation has automated the scoring of student responses and data collection, streamlining the assessment processes and facilitating efficient large-scale assessments. It has also enhanced scalability, making the CAT suitable for widespread use in educational settings. Furthermore, it provides immediate feedback to students and educators, supporting timely interventions and personalised learning experiences. Our study aims to comprehensively investigate algorithmic competencies in compulsory education, examining their variations and influencing factors. This research examines key variables, such as age, sex, educational environment and school characteristics (e.g., the level and grade of education), and regional factors (e.g., the canton of the school) in Switzerland, and characteristics related to the specific assessment tool, including the type of artefact used, the complexity of the algorithms generated, and the level of autonomy. Additionally, it seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the unplugged and digital approaches in assessing AT skills, specifically comparing the unplugged and virtual CAT versions, aiming to provide insights into their advantages and potential synergies. This investigation delineates the developmental progression of AT skills across compulsory education, emphasising the influence of age on algorithm development and problem-solving strategies. Furthermore, we reveal the impact of artefacts and the potential of digital tools to facilitate advanced AT skill development across diverse age groups. Finally, our investigation delves into the influence of school environments and sex disparities on AT performance, alongside the significant individual variability influenced by personal abilities and external circumstances. These findings underscore the importance of tailored educational interventions and equitable practices to accommodate diverse learning profiles and optimise student outcomes in AT across educational settings."
CANNAVO2020102450,A visual editing tool supporting the production of 3D interactive graphics assets for public exhibitions,"The introduction of interactive assets in public exhibitions is capable to significantly enhance the visitors’ user experience. However, the creation of interactive applications could represent a challenging task, especially for users lacking computer skills. Visual programming languages (VPLs) – one of the instruments belonging to the broad categories of methods and tools devised to support end-user development (EUD) – promise to offer an intuitive way to overcome these limitations, by providing easy-to-use and efficient interfaces for encoding applications’ logic. Moving from these considerations, this paper first analyses pros and cons of tools devised so far to support the generation of interactive contents. Then, it presents the design of a new tool named Visual Scene Editor (VSE), which allows users with little to no programming skills to create 3D interactive applications by combining available assets through an interactive, visual process. Both objective and subjective measurements have been collected with both skilled and unskilled users to evaluate the performance of the proposed tool. A comparison with existing solutions shows a reduction in the time required to complete the assigned tasks, of the complexity of the logic created, as well as of the number of errors made, confirming the suitability of the VSE for the said purpose."
CHEN2025205,"Application of machine learning in higher education to predict students’ performance, learning engagement and self-efficacy: a systematic literature review","Purpose
In recent years, studies have shown that machine learning significantly improves student performance and retention and reduces the risk of student dropout and withdrawal. However, there is a lack of empirical research reviews focusing on the application of machine learning to predict student performance in terms of learning engagement and self-efficacy and exploring their relationships. Hence, this paper conducts a systematic research review on the application of machine learning in higher education from an empirical research perspective.
Design/methodology/approach
This systematic review examines the application of machine learning (ML) in higher education, focusing on predicting student performance, engagement and self-efficacy. The review covers empirical studies from 2016 to 2024, utilizing a PRISMA framework to select 67 relevant articles from major databases.
Findings
The findings show that ML applications are widely researched and published in high-impact journals. The primary functions of ML in these studies include performance prediction, engagement analysis and self-efficacy assessment, employing various ML algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks. Ensemble learning algorithms generally outperform single algorithms regarding accuracy and other evaluation metrics. Common model evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1 score, recall and precision, with newer methods also being explored.
Research limitations/implications
First, empirical research literature was selected from only four renowned electronic journal databases, and the literature was limited to journal articles, with the latest review literature and conference papers published in the form of conference papers also excluded, which led to empirical research not obtaining the latest views of researchers in interdisciplinary fields. Second, this review focused mainly on the analysis of student grade prediction, learning engagement and self-efficacy and did not study students’ risk, dropout rates, retention rates or learning behaviors, which limited the scope of the literature review and the application field of machine learning algorithms. Finally, this article only conducted a systematic review of the application of machine learning algorithms in higher education and did not establish a metadata list or carry out metadata analysis.
Originality/value
The review highlights ML’s potential to enhance personalized education, early intervention and identifying at-risk students. Future research should improve prediction accuracy, explore new algorithms and address current study limitations, particularly the narrow focus on specific outcomes and lack of interdisciplinary perspectives."
SHUTE2021106647,Stealth assessment of creativity in a physics video game,"Creativity has been of research interest to psychologists dating back many decades, and is currently recognized as one of the essential skills needed to succeed in our complex, interconnected world. One medium that has affordances to assess and support creativity in young people is video games. In this paper, we briefly discuss the literature on video games and creativity and provide an example of current work being done relative to measuring creativity in the context of a game called Physics Playground using stealth assessment. To validate the stealth assessment of creativity, we conducted a one-group pretest-posttest study with 167 8th and 9th graders from a K-12 school in Florida. Results suggest that our stealth assessment of creativity is valid (i.e., our stealth assessment estimate significantly correlated with our external performance-based measures of creativity). Additional analyses revealed that creativity (i.e., estimated using our stealth assessment of creativity) significantly predicts in-game performance (e.g., number of levels solved), game enjoyment, and learning of physics content. We conclude with a discussion of future directions in this line of creativity research."
HUANG2024152294,Machine learning in energy storage material discovery and performance prediction,"Energy storage material is one of the critical materials in modern life. However, due to the difficulty of material development, the existing mainstream batteries still use the materials system developed decades ago. Machine learning (ML) is rapidly changing the paradigm of energy storage material discovery and performance prediction due to its ability to solve complex problems efficiently and automatically. Various excellent works are constantly emerging in the field of ML assisted or dominated development of energy storage material, such as exploring of new materials, studying of battery performance, investigating of battery aging mechanism. In this paper, we methodically review recent advances in discovery and performance prediction of energy storage materials relying on ML. After a brief introduction to the general workflow of ML, we provide an overview of the current status and dilemmas of ML databases commonly used in energy storage materials. The typical applications and examples of ML to the finding of novel energy storage materials and the performance forecasting of electrode and electrolyte materials. Furthermore, we explore the dilemmas that will be faced in the development of applied ML-assisted or dominated energy storage materials and propose a corresponding outlook. This review systematically summarizes the current development of ML-assisted energy storage materials research, which is expected to point the way for its further development."
ZITO2021100222,Leveraging tangible interfaces in primary school math: Pilot testing of the Owlet math program,"This paper presents pilot testing of Owlet, a math program based on two original, tangible interface devices for primary school math and their accompanying apps. We built on prior work that demonstrated promising outcomes regarding manipulatives in math education and tangible user interfaces in a variety of applications. The Owlet program was pilot tested in ten classrooms, spanning students ages 5 to 11. We found that teachers used the exploratory activities to introduce the program, and other activities to encourage differentiated, student-paced practice of math concepts. Students were interested and engaged in using Owlet during the pilot tests, leading to student driven generation of challenges. Through development, Owlet, as a whole program, spanned more math concepts by prioritizing flexibility in one tangible interface and concreteness in the other. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each tangible device."
ANTLE2022100374,Research in Child–Computer Interaction: Provocations and envisioning future directions,"In the 21st century the academic field of Child–Computer Interaction (CCI) arose alongside burgeoning interactive technology and digital media industries that targeted children. We believe that the field of CCIU is at an important point in its development, analogous to when a child becomes a teen. Over the last few years we have each had many informal conversations with other CCI researchers in which we discuss issues such as, what is our responsibility as researchers beyond academe? What values underlie our conceptions of a ”good” childhood and the role of interactive technology in it? And, how do we ensure that our field continues to grow and evolve in ways that are consistent with our responsibilities and values? To address these and other complex questions that have been drawing our attention we came together to reflect, discuss and create a position paper for our community, in which we outline some of the issues we see facing our community at this time. To inform our deliberations with opinions beyond our own we conducted an informal consultation with 25 members of the CCI community. Our responders spanned junior to senior researchers, represented diverse geographies and included industry practitioners. These diverse responses provided further content for our reflections, and helped us see perspectives beyond our own. The result of this informal process is this speculative paper in which we propose a series of seven provocations that aim to disrupt some of the normative assumptions held in our field. Our goal in doing this is to open up dialogue in our community about these issues and promote consideration of the alternative visions we present for where we might focus our attention and efforts. We see our contribution not as truth or a definitive statement of a vision for the field, but rather as our opinion about some of the complex issues we face and that we think should be considered through dialogue as we move into the next phase of our development as an academic and scholarly community. We believe that it is urgent and critical for our field that we take up these questions, explore diverse perspectives, and critically work towards decisions and actions that will define our identity and the value of our contributions as we move forward into the next 20 years of research in CCI."
STRYCKER2020e04358,K-12 art teacher technology use and preparation,"Largely absent from educational/instructional technology journals, this study focused on how K-12 art teachers in a southern state used technology to support teaching and learning, uses they found to be the best, and what kinds of technology training they received as part of their initial teacher preparation. Findings indicated that presentation and resource access technologies had transformed the way art teachers in the study work with students and materials. They also had little use of technology to support students with special needs and had limited technology experiences in their own training. Elementary art teachers were found to have more examples of student higher-order thinking skills promoting technology use, while secondary art teachers had more student media creation and a desire to implement digital portfolios. Additional findings and interpretations are offered."
LEPRI2021102249,Ethical machines: The human-centric use of artificial intelligence,"Summary
Today's increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. Algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be influenced by prejudice, conflicts of interest, or fatigue. However, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. In this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric AI: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy."
PINSKI2024100062,"AI literacy for users – A comprehensive review and future research directions of learning methods, components, and effects","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought transformative changes to various aspects of human life, leading to an exponential increase in the number of AI users. The broad access and usage of AI enable immense benefits but also give rise to significant challenges. One way for AI users to address these challenges is to develop AI literacy, referring to human proficiency in different subject areas of AI that enable purposeful, efficient, and ethical usage of AI technologies. This study aims to comprehensively understand and structure the research on AI literacy for AI users through a systematic, scoping literature review. Therefore, we synthesize the literature, provide a conceptual framework, and develop a research agenda. Our review paper holistically assesses the fragmented AI literacy research landscape (68 papers) while critically examining its specificity to different user groups and its distinction from other technology literacies, exposing that research efforts are partly not well integrated. We organize our findings in an overarching conceptual framework structured along the learning methods leading to, the components constituting, and the effects stemming from AI literacy. Our research agenda – oriented along the developed conceptual framework – sheds light on the most promising research opportunities to prepare AI users for an AI-powered future of work and society."
PDELOPE2021100429,A novel UML-based methodology for modeling adventure-based educational games,"In the last years, serious games have been successfully exploited in different areas. However, in spite of the powerful tool that this kind of video games has proved to be in the classroom, a few methodological efforts have been conducted in order to involve pedagogues or educators in the design loop of these games or, one step further, include students in the co-design process to promote learning through design as a context. With this objective, this paper presents a set of metamodels that could facilitate the conceptual design of this type of games. To this end, a complete graphical notation based on the UML standard (with adaptations) is defined for representing the components of this type of games; having in mind to improve the collaboration between the team of educators/students and the technical team during the design process. Finally, the design diagrams defined during the production of a specific serious game, titled Uranus, are illustrated, in order to show the feasibility of the proposal. In addition, a validation experience was conducted with educators and computer engineering students in order to test the value of the proposed graphic notation to design educational games."
MARKAUSKAITE2022100056,Rethinking the entwinement between artificial intelligence and human learning: What capabilities do learners need for a world with AI?,"The proliferation of AI in many aspects of human life—from personal leisure, to collaborative professional work, to global policy decisions—poses a sharp question about how to prepare people for an interconnected, fast-changing world which is increasingly becoming saturated with technological devices and agentic machines. What kinds of capabilities do people need in a world infused with AI? How can we conceptualise these capabilities? How can we help learners develop them? How can we empirically study and assess their development? With this paper, we open the discussion by adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. Our team of 11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written discussion. Engaging in a semi-independent and semi-joint written polylogue, we assembled a pool of ideas of what these capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop them. Simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine our hypothetical views. In synthesising these ideas, we propose that there is a need to move beyond AI-centred views of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values."

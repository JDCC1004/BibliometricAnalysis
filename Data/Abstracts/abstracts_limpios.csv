7044224,Scratching the surface of digital literacy… but we need to go deeper,"the popularization of digital educational devices with low barriers to entry has encouraged the development of many training activities oriented towards the incorporation of technology in schools. in some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. however, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. this study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like scratch. for this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of scratch programming achieved by the students of the school of education of vitoria-gasteiz and their engagement with scratch. we also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in scratch workshops with us. after this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. since we consider scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status."

10343894,How to Develop CT Skills Using Robotics Projects Combined with Arts - a Pilot Study,"with the introduction of distance learning during the lockdown, teachers faced a number of problems on how to implement the teaching. educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. in our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. however, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. as a similar situation occurred in several european countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. the methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. in this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity a project using the currently developed methodology. the results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. the project combined the theme of greek myths with robotics using lego spike prime. during the validation, we focused primarily on students work with basic programming concepts. our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. the paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes."
8155009,Idea Garden: Situated Support for Problem Solving by End-User Programmers,"although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. we hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. therefore, in this paper, we describe the idea garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. the idea garden has its roots in minimalist learning theory and problem-solving theories. our proof-of-concept prototype of the idea garden concept in the coscripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. it does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted."

7757410,"A review of models for introducing computational thinking, computer science and computing in K-12 education","computer science is becoming ever increasingly important to our society. computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at k-12 level entails. also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. in this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their k-12 education. the countries are australia, england, estonia, finland, new zealand, norway, sweden, south korea, poland and usa. the studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. the most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. a few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school."
7504696,Programming moves: Design and evaluation of applying embodied interaction in virtual environments to enhance computational thinking in middle school students,"we detail the design, implementation, and an initial evaluation of a virtual reality education and entertainment (edutainment) application called virtual environment interactions (venvi). venvi is an application in which students learn computer science concepts through the process of choreographing movement for a virtual character using a fun and intuitive interface. in this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. a subset of those students (16) participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in venvi. in creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within venvi facilitated students edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence. students also showed increased interest and excitement regarding the computing field at the end of their summer camp experience using venvi."
7393614,Teaching Structured Authoring and DITA Through Rhetorical and Computational Thinking,"background: the diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the darwin information typing architecture (dita). this teaching case describes how component content management and dita were integrated into the creating user documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. research questions: how can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach english and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow how can computational abstraction be combined with students previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the dita to create technical documentation situating the case: the development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between dita, computational thinking, and rhetorical genre theory. specifically, the concept of layers of abstraction guides the development of the courses structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. how the case was studied: the case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from fall 2012 through fall 2013. about the case: initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an english department. an affordable solution was adopting the open-source dita standard, using free trials or open-source editors. the intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students previous rhetorical knowledge: layer 1: developing quality documentation, layer 2: separating content from design, layer 3: authoring granular content with xml, layer 4: authoring and linking component content management modules with dita, and layer 5: single-sourcing and content reuse. this case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. results and conclusions: although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. the teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students existing knowledge of genres and their constraints."
8190652,Exploring computational thinking assessment in introductory programming courses,"several instruments have been used for assessing computational thinking (ct) abilities. in this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure ct abilities. bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote computer science and ct. the test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. our broad research question is whether we can evolve bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure ct abilities. in this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: is bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses is there any correlation between bebras performance and students grades do students improve their performance in bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated bebras tests. the first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. the second one was applied at the end of the term. the results suggest that the performance on bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. we conclude that it is not very likely that ct measures can be derived from the bebras test as it is currently designed. while further research is needed on how we can leverage the bebras effort to extend it into a ct assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of item response theory (irt) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. we expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on ct assessment as well as to the bebras effort to educate ct."

6032639,Collaborative teaching of globally distributed software development: community building workshop (CTGDSD 2011),"software engineering project courses where student teams are geographically distributed can effectively simulate the problems of globally distributed software development (dsd). however, this pedagogical model has proven difficult to adopt or sustain. it requires significant pedagogical resources and collaboration infrastructure. institutionalizing such courses also requires compatible and reliable teaching partners. the purpose of this workshop is to foster a community of international faculty and institutions committed to developing, supporting, and teaching dsd. foundational materials presented will include pedagogical materials and infrastructure developed and used in teaching dsd courses along with results and lessons learned. long-range goals include: lowering adoption barriers by providing common pedagogical materials, validated collaboration infrastructure, and a pool of potential teaching partners from around the globe."
10211374,A Teacher-Focused Impact Assessment in Scratch4All Project,"the scratch4all project aims to reduce school dropout rates by encouraging and motivating students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary schools to achieve academic success. in addition, the project promotes true equality of opportunity in terms of educational resources. a learning environment that contributes positively to the improvement of educational results is created through the use of new technologies, specifically programming in the scratch language and robotics. impact indicators were developed and used as project evaluation tools based on theory of change. this paper presents and analyzes the changes observed from the perspective of the projects teachers stakeholders during the 20202021 school year. this group of beneficiaries is critical to the projects success and continuation, not only because of the special relationship they have with the students, but also with their families and the school. the assessment of impact is very positive in terms of indicators such as school success and motivation, particularly in mathematics and portuguese language, as well as in the reduction of inequalities, access to new technologies, and contribution to gender equality."
9829452,Applications of Machine Learning to Form-giving in Industrial Design,"machine learning is a key technology to design and develop products, systems, and even services. in particular, image classification using deep learning has been successfully applied to many fields. although industrial designers might learn this is an opportunity for their best practice, studies demonstrating how to integrate the technology into the design process are rare. thus, we discussed the need to introduce ml to industrial design by presenting examples and ml tools with lower scientific thresholds such as weka that is preferable for industrial design students and practitioners. a five-stage process of applying ml to product form-giving is presented to illustrate the bridging of ml to the design process. further technical details and industry case studies are needed to demonstrate evidence of the advantages of ml in form-giving. the implication is not only in sharpening the tools of product form-giving but also in rethinking the theories of industrial design."
9272475,Bridge to Computing: An outreach program for at-risk young men,"in 2017, our police department and the give back organization (gbo), a local non-profit, contacted our university about hosting a game development summer camp. the camp was proposed to keep boys ages 12-15 living in a community with high levels of gang enrollment off the streets while providing an opportunity to learn about college and computing careers. the police also wanted to improve officer-youth r elations. our lab provided camp counselors, space, and content for the camp. each camp supported a total of twelve african-american boys. over three years, we refactored the curricula and organization of the camp and present our lessons learned from the experience."
9490241,Teaching Machine Learning in K–12 Classroom: Pedagogical and Technological Trajectories for Artificial Intelligence Education,"over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of ai-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in k-12 computing education, too. as machine learning enters k-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. but as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in k-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. despite the central position of machine learning and ai in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. this is especially true of the k-12 curriculum space. this article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in k-12 education. the article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that k-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. the article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader k-12 computing curricula. a crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based traditional programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking."
9529183,"Applying Game Learning Analytics to a Voluntary Video Game: Intrinsic Motivation, Persistence, and Rewards in Learning to Program at an Early Age","learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of computational thinking. game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. these aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust computational thinking curricula. with this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. the analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. it was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. in terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards."
8783523,Teaching and Learning Computer Science for Primary School Teachers: an Argentine Experience,"in this work, we present a line of research focus on the didactics of teaching and learning of computer science for primary school. our approach combines the training of teachers in computational thinking with unplugged activities (without the use of computer) and plugged ones, involving programming of computers and other devices. as a first instance of training, we presents the design and implementation of the higher level teaching specialization in didactics of computer science, approved by the educational ministry of santa fe, argentine. the objective of this specialization is that the primary teachers can appropriate of computational thinking skills and the potential of programming, to include them in their educational practices in a contextualized, interdisciplinary and inclusive way. as results, an opinion poll is presented on a first stage of this training, from which it is possible to extract positive opinions of the teachers regarding the contents and didactics of the specialization that they are carrying out."
9994685,Do Structured Flowcharts Outperform Pseudocode? Evidence From Eye Movements,"computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. one step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. this article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. in our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. in addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. the difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. for complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills."
6824112,Analyzing the Learning Process in Online Educational Game Design: A Case Study,"educational game design environments are used for teaching computational thinking and software engineering concepts to novices. in software engineering education, there has recently been calls for innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses (http:2014.icse-conferences.orgseet). however, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. in line with the new educational opportunities provided by the web such as massive open online courses (moocs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. to understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. while the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums."
8659041,Effects of Professional Development on Programming Knowledge and Self-Efficacy,"this research full paper presents the effects of our weeklong professional development class on the programming skills of nineteen high school teachers, their confidence in programming, and their confidence for teaching programming. a primary objective of the cs10k and cs for all initiatives is the education of k-12 teachers in aspects of computer science and computational thinking so they can teach cs courses in their schools. many of these educators have degrees in disciplines other than computer science, such as math, science, and business, so preparing them to teach cs is a challenge, particularly since most k-12 teachers have limited time to devote to learning new curriculum. this study describes how we managed a short course in computational thinking and programming to a group of high school teachers. we illustrate through survey data assessment and evaluation that significant gains in skill level and self-efficacy can be realized within a short but intensive week of face-to-face training. five months later we follow-up with the same cohort to see if earlier achievements remain evident over time. discussion throughout the paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of the training week, which is useful to others planning to undertake similar pd offerings."
9637170,Adapting an OER Textbook for the Inverted Classroom Model — How To Flip the Classroom with BBC micro:bit Example Tasks,"full paper research-to-practice the current covid-19 crisis has created significant challenges for schools. the growing importance of flipping the classroom and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. to meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. the open educational resource (oer) textbook computational thinking with the bbc micro:bit was developed for the introduction of computational thinking (ct) for 10-14-year-old pupils in austrias secondary schools. example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. this article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the inverted classroom model (icm) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons the respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with icm. the central advantage of the icm is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. it allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. the textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment makecode. additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. the many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. a design-based research (dbr) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. teachers, who are already familiar with the bbc micro:bit and the oer textbook, were trained on how to use the flip-version of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. the didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of dbr. results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale."

9569250,Identifying Preliminary Design Principles for a Robotics-based Learning Environment,"in recent years, the interest in introducing programming activities into the classroom has increased, emphasizing the importance of promoting computational thinking in young learners. robotics-based learning environments are intended to facilitate the learning of programming at the primary level and support developing skills such as collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving thinking in a cross-curricular approach. an austrian research project focuses on developing and implementing a robotics-based learning environment using the educational design research approach to gain insights into the introduction of computational thinking in primary education. this paper reports on a study to identify preliminary design principles of the learning environment that form the basis of the prototyping cycle of the overall research. data were collected by interviewing seven experts who have theoretical and practical expertise on educational robotics in primary education. the resulting six preliminary design principles describe the first insight into the design of robotics-based learning environments."
8783592,Production of Scratch Learning Objects by Elementary School Students,"the development of computational thinking through visual programming using resources such as scratch has been used frequently in teaching and learning contexts due to the important contributions to these processes. in order to integrate the work of development of computational thinking into the curricular pedagogical content and the protagonism of the students, this paper presents practical suggestions for using scratch as a tool for learning objects production by students for students. the suggestions are the result of the experience developed in a school of the public school of cascavelpr whose results show that this integration promotes interest in the content and commitment of the students, making learning meaningful."
10714578,RULER: Prebugging with Proxy-Based Programming,"while block-based programming has successfully eliminated critical syntactic barriers to programming, it remains unclear how effectively it aids in overcoming semantic, logical, and pragmatic programming challenges that hinder computational thinking. these challenges are likely to far outweigh the syntactic ones. with the goal of creating a highly accessible programming tool for young students using mobile devices, we explored the concept of pragmatic prebugging to begin addressing these challenges. by pragmatic prebugging, we refer to proactive debugging tools designed to prevent logical errors. this article introduces ruler.game as a computational thinking tool with built-in pragmatic prebugging, enabling novice programmers to create games through a paradigm we call proxy-based programming. a small study exploring error rates found statistically significant performance improvements of proxy-based programming compared to block-based programming."
10654434,Problem-Solving Through Pair-Programming: The Mediational Role of ChatGPT,"in this study the pair computational problem-solving between the student and chatgpt was analyzed. the three university students who were experienced in using python program in computational problem-solving participated in the study. in data collection, a problem involving limit and sequence from calculus was used to examine students collaboration with chatgpt. students were asked to construct a program that produces a solution to this problem in python, and meanwhile, it was stated that they could work in pairs with chatgpt. the responses provided by chatgpt to the students in the computational problem-solving were evaluated in both computational and mathematical contexts and a list of cases in which chatgpt could and could not support students in the computational thinking practices was created. aside from the incorrect or implicit answers provided by chatgpt, in general, it was determined that chatgpt supported the students performance in computational thinking. it was deduced that it was important for the student to make a rational problem-solving plan and to guide the chatgpt with the appropriate prompts in order to use rational questioning that leads to productive argumentation with chatgpt."
10569899,The Importance of Algorithmic Thinking Development in Primary Education,"advances in computer technology have expanded our capacity to solve problems on a scale never imagined, using strategies previously unavailable to us. todays digital natives have grown up in a world where technology is rapidly evolving, creating new fields of study, new types of jobs, and requiring new skill sets. algorithmic and computational thinking are foundations for solving different problems from all domains and are not always closely related to computers and programming. they are currently primarily used in teaching computer science and stem subjects but can be applied to all subjects and in all life situations. the paper presents the need to develop computational thinking in various subjects of primary education, with particular emphasis on combining digital (plugged) and non-digital (unplugged) activities, as well as on the development of algorithmic thinking. four methodological scenarios with activities for the development of algorithmic thinking in primary education are presented."
10578599,Information Encoding in Computer Science Education Using the Cup Song,"problem solving plays a central role in computer science classes, whereby the problems to be analyzed are often already available in encoded form. the initial process where the learners have to parse information into symbols using adequate representations, has hardly been considered systematically so far. however, encoding development is essential for the understanding of sign processes and for general education. this paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called cup song encoding designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. it simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters computational thinking of students. the material of the teaching unit is available online. the teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in k-12 during which the students solutions were recorded and examined. the outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to k-12 computer science education. the results also show how computational thinking methods can be integrated in computer science classes."

8735739,DeepStealth: Game-Based Learning Stealth Assessment With Deep Neural Networks,"a distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students competencies through evidence-centered design. in evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using bayesian networks. this article presents deepstealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. deepstealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. we investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (lstms) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (ffnns). we compare these models predictive performance for inferring students knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (crfs) and nave bayes models. we perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models early prediction capacity. the framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. results indicate that lstm-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. we find that lstms, ffnns, and crfs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures."
7940091,Computational Creativity Exercises: An Avenue for Promoting Learning in Computer Science,"computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both within and outside of computer science (cs). the goal of the project discussed here is to increase students achievement in cs courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (cces). in this paper, the framework of cces is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. students in introductory cs courses completed cces as part of those courses. students in study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in study 2 were engineering majors. a profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the cces could be accounted for by differences in students motivated and self-regulated engagement. overall, cces had positive impacts on students grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the cces was generally consistent across profiles. the cces appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory cs courses. implications and directions for future research are discussed."

9223343,When Positive Perception of the Robot Has No Effect on Learning,"humanoid robots, with a focus on personalised social behaviours, are increasingly being deployed in educational settings to support learning. however, crafting pedagogical hri designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. as a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called justhink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. justhink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robots behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. to this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants engagement with the activity (intrinsic motivation inventory-imi), their mutual understanding (imilike) and perception of the robot (godspeed questionnaire); (ii) participants performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. we carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. surprisingly, we observe that while a teams performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities."
9202832,Automatic Formative Assessment in Computer Science: Guidance to Model-Driven Design,"adaptive online learning can facilitate students support by responding immediately to the users interactions. good feedback to students helps closing the gap between actual and desired performance. in this paper we analyze how to introduce online adaptive formative learning in computer science, a discipline with well documented challenges that are hard to tackle with traditional classroom methods. specifically, we developed illustrative learning items teaching model-driven design and implemented them in an online system that implements a model for automatic formative assessment developed by university of torino. the model takes advantage of an automatic assessment system initially designed for stem disciplines, then adopted for teaching languages and other disciplines too. the key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. these features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects. we chose mdd because it is a topic of computer science education connected with computational thinking, software design, and formal methods, which are three of the core areas in need of enhanced support."
6377388,Using Microworlds to Introduce Programming to Novices,"introduction to programming is a traditional and compulsory course for first year computer science students. however, research in the field of computer science education has highlighted that many students lack on problem solving and computational thinking skills. these issues provoke questions in the academic community as to whether the learning methodology of introductory to programming courses is appropriate. as regards the pedagogical procedure in general, the teacher-centered model was amended with the introduction of interactive learning environments, which promote distributed learning. in this paper, we examine the fundamental skills needed for introductory to programming courses. additionally, we focus on some of the most popular micro worlds and evaluate them in terms of educational suitability."
7474667,A case study on cooperative problem solving processes in small 9th grade student groups,"it is one of a teachers challenges in lesson planning to consider all levels of learning involving students team skills while taking the actual subject content into account. this descriptive study examines how the student-centered approach can be utilized as supportive classroom climate and how it can be combined with cooperative team tasks for solving computational thinking problems using an easy accessible computer-coding environment. drawing on existing concepts and research methods this study applies a case study approach with mixed methods to investigate students development of team-attitudes and characteristics of team cooperation. it turned out, that students identified the quality of cooperation in their teams as beneficial and productive while from an outside point of view their teamwork seemed to be unorganized and not cooperative. these contradicting results were clarified in a classroom meeting, where it became clear, that the student-centered classroom climate still could have influenced students team attitudes in a way that students felt comfortable to express themselves in their, sometimes not so nice, youth language during problem solving tasks but while be able to solve problems effectively."
8622634,Automating the Detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Japanese-American WWII Incarceration Camp Records,"we describe computational treatments of archival collections through a case study involving world war ii japanese-american incarceration camps. we focus on automating the detection of personally identifiable information or pii. the paper also discusses the emergence of computational archival science (cas) and the development of a computational framework for library and archival education. computational thinking practices are applied to archival science practices. these include: (1) data creation, manipulation, analysis, and visualization (2) designing and constructing computational models, and (3) computer programming, developing modular computational solutions, and troubleshooting and debugging. we conclude with pii algorithm accuracy, transparency, and performance considerations and future developments."
10054368,A Systematic Literature Review in Robotics Experiential Learning With Computational and Adversarial Thinking,"the rise of the industrial revolution 4.0 and the increasing reliance on the digital economy drive the need for a new set of skills, especially in robotics learning, that includes computational thinking (ct) and adversarial thinking (at) for the young generation. the need for ct-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. therefore, adopting robotic learning with ct and at can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. this paper presents a systematic literature review on ct and at practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. this study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: acm, scopus, ieee xplore, and sciencedirect. sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase ct and at skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. the studys findings show that ct and at are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. these considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. the study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. the findings suggest that ct and at can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. for future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with ct and at applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of ct and at applications."
8659071,Sol y Agua: A Game-based Learning Platform to Engage Middle-school Students in STEM,"full paper, research-to-practice. with the nations continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (stem) education at all levels. contributing factors to the low representation in stem areas are the lack of hispanic youths exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. in addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a filter that prevents many students from pursuing advanced stem courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring stem subjects and careers later in their education. this paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to stem fields in a majority hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. the platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules. the concepts introduced in the platform are universal enough to be successfully employed in other geographical regions with different student demographics."

8268242,Data-structure validator: An application of the HY-DE model,"in knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. however, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. national and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. the essence of the hy-de model is to aid the students learning process with the help of the teachers purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). one aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the hy-de model, entitled data-structure validator hy-de model (dasva hy-de). in the introductory phase, the dasva model focuses on how the hy-de attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. in the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. the automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. the final result of this conversion process isare well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. the application of the original hy-de model would lead us to its modification. in the advanced phase of the dasva hy-de model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. with this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep andor mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status."

9764091,Implementing Blended Learning in K-12 Programming Course: Lesson Design and Student Feedback,"computational thinking (ct) has been widely integrated into k-12 classrooms through programming education. numerous initiatives have been developed to lower down the threshold for learning programming, yet instructors may still feel ill-prepared. blended learning approach, a combination of student-centered learning and teacher-centered instruction, has proved to be an effective teaching approach for k-12 programming courses. with the purpose of providing practical insights for the design of blended programming lessons, this study introduced an instructional unit of a k-12 programming course in a secondary school in china. it elaborated the course regarding lesson design, learning assessment, and course evaluation. the course contains 9 plugged sessions and 24 unplugged sessions, and each session consists of 1) a preview, 2) hands-on activities, and 3) a lesson summary. student learning was evaluated with performance-based assessments, and a questionnaire was employed to collect students feedback for the course. the results indicated that students with low performance were the benefit the most from the course, and students tended to like visual programming tool and stage-mode learning format. also, students with different learning backgrounds showed different preferences for the instructional elements. suggestions are provided for further research and course design practices."
9962388,A Python-based lab module to conduct thermodynamic cycle analysis,"a python-based lab activity was developed for a remote thermodynamics course to add computational thinking to traditional analytical problem solving. python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. combining python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. a five-week python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. the module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. the lab module began with an introduction to python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard rankine, gas turbine, and vapor compression cycles. the lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using google colab. this paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. results indicate a strong positive impact on python programming learning outcomes. students acquired a working knowledge of python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. at the same time, the student feedback indicated students resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers. nevertheless, the positive learning outcomes were encouraging. whether students pursue a career in thermodynamics or in a broader engineering field, this lab experience equipped them with tools that can augment their engineering skills."

9637257,Mutual Improvement between Teaching Materials and Assessment Tools for K-12 Programming Education,"this innovative practice full paper presents an approach to improve teaching materials and assessment tools for k-12 programming education together by creating a virtuous cycle. improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development. in this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. the assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. this kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. in japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in april 2020 in elementary schools and in april 2021 in junior high schools respectively. they will be implemented in april 2022 in high schools. since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. however, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. in order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, dc-motors, leds, and sensors. in our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students computational thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. we have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together."
9911432,Modelling Assessment Rubrics through Bayesian Networks: a Pragmatic Approach,"automatic assessment of learner competencies is a fundamental task in intelligent tutoring systems. an assessment rubric typically and effectively describes relevant competencies and competence levels. this paper presents an approach to deriving a learner model directly from an assessment rubric defining some (partial) ordering of competence levels. the model is based on bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. we illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills. the simple elicitation of the model starting from the assessment rubric opens up the possibility of quickly automating the assessment of several tasks, making them more easily exploitable in the context of adaptive assessment tools and intelligent tntorino systems."
9904876,An Ontology to Formalize a Creative Problem Solving Activity,"our study is set in an educational context: to better teach and assess 21st-century skills, such as computational thinking or creative problem solving, we propose to formalize a specific activity that involves these competencies. this activity, referred to as creacube, is presented as an open-ended problem which consists of assembling a set of robotic cubes into an autonomous vehicle. we not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. the chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. this allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments. this operationalization of a creative problem-solving activity is part of an exploratory research action. in addition, an effective proof of concept is described in this study."
10892884,Notional Machines for Inclusive Learning,"understanding computing concepts is one of the foundational elements of computational thinking, which helps students formulate logic and algorithms for effectively developing and designing codes. however, novice learners often struggle to understand basic computing concepts, such as variables, loops, arrays, conditionals, and functions. this is often caused by the invisibility of the computing mechanism and the complexity of language syntax and conventions. moreover, challenges in learning computing concepts can be compounded for learners with atypical conditions (e.g. visual, cognitive, and learning impairment, attention deficit, and neurodivergence). to tackle this, teachers of typical ability learners frequently use notional machines (nms) - simplified representations (e.g. diagrams, flow charts, and analogies) created to assist novice programmers in understanding abstract concepts, program execution, and dynamics. in addition, traditional learning activities may need assistive learning interventions (alis) and learner-oriented practices like physical tactile models, computing artifacts, and interactive learning tools. nm approaches tend to focus on the explanation of concepts from instructor to learner, while alis tend to focus on learner support in activities. both methods can provide advantages for learning, and we expect that a combined approach would provide even greater synergy for all learners. however, little consideration has been given to how nm and ali approaches could be effectively combined. this research investigates how nm and ali can be effectively brought together more holistically as an inclusive pedagogical tool - notional machines for inclusive learning (nmil). in this full paper, we develop the conceptualization of nmil, grounded in previous nm and ali research. we also propose a structured method for creating nmil. finally, we also develop a physical nmil model, based on the structured nmil creation method, to teach lists in python, as part of an introductory computer science course."
10258248,Towards Data-Driving Multi-View Evaluation Framework for Scratch,"as one of the most popular visual programming languages, scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. at the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. most of the existing evaluations on scratch are carried from three perspectives: computational thinking (ct) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. among them, the assessment of ct and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. the single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. in this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. we quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions."
10834323,"Impact of Enhanced Learning Approaches on STEM-Focused Education for School Children in Assam, India","in todays growing digital era, young students emphasis on science and technology has multi-folded into the development of computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving mindset, and better learning outcomes. traditionally, young children who tend to perform well academically are expected to become more successful in their careers rather than the skill set they learn and develop their cognition for better opportunities. on the contrary, skill set also plays a significant role in enhancing student engagement towards stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education. implementing educational robots and artificial intelligence in stem classrooms as teaching tools represents a transformative approach to modern teaching methods. incorporating a fun-based, hands-on learning environment using programming, designing, and problem-solving tasks for students to enhance their cognitive abilities can stimulate curiosity and innovation among them. the novelty of this study is that it analyses two case studies on introducing robotics and artificial intelligence among school children of rural-based schools in assam, india, which enhances the participating students self-efficacy, technical knowledge, and problem-solving attitude. this study aims to analyze the impact of an enhanced learning approach on school students regarding knowledge gain, self-worth, and innovative thinking compared to traditional teaching methods. academicians from the indian institute of technology guwahati have been a part of the sessions provided to children. the data collection and analysis have been approved by the participants and their school teachers. a set of questions was developed to understand some knowledge-based and perception-based parameters through prepost-tests and draw-a-robot activity. this study demonstrates positive effect sizes (cohens d 1.64 and 5.41) from both case studies and statistic t-values to support the alternate hypothesis on a greater effect of implementing enhanced teaching methods for stem education."
9511416,An Advanced Intrusion Detection System for IIoT Based on GA and Tree Based Algorithms,"the evolution of the internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale internet of things (iot)-based ecosystems, such as industrial iot (iiot). the iot and, by virtue, the iiot, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. so it is crucial to develop intrusion detection systems (idss) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of iiot networks. in this research, we propose an ids for iiot that was implemented using the genetic algorithm (ga) for feature selection, and the random forest (rf) model was employed in the ga fitness function. the models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the rf, linear regression (lr), nave bayes (nb), decision tree (dt), extra-trees (et), and extreme gradient boosting (xgb). the ga-rf generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. the unsw-nb15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. the experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the ga-rf achieved a test accuracy (tac) of 87.61 and an area under the curve (auc) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. these results were superior to existing ids frameworks."
10190587,The Deep Sleep Optimizer: A Human-Based Metaheuristic Approach,"owing to the no free lunch theorem, no single optimisation algorithm can solve all optimisation problems accurately, so new optimisation techniques are required. in this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (dso) is proposed. the deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. the dso is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. the mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. the performance of dso is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesmans problems. additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the wilcoxon rank sum, and the friedman test. lastly, the dso is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including ga, pso, tlbo, and gwo. the dso fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics."

10287938,SecFedIDM-V1: A Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model With Blockchain and Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network,"cloud computing is a technology for efficiently using computing infrastructures and a business model for selling computing resources and services. however, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the internet, a single intrusion detection system (ids) can be overwhelmed. despite the various deep learning (dl) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. this work proposes a secure federated intrusion detection model version 1 (secfedidm-v1) using blockchain technology and bidirectional long short-term memory (bilstm) recurrent neural network (rnn). the cobourg intrusion detection dataset (cidds) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. the developed secfedidm-v1 was later deployed as a python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. the attack packets are recorded in a hyperledger fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. from the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 bilstm network performed better than gru with a precision of 0.99624, recall of 0.99906, f1 score of 0.99614, false positive rate (fpr) of 0.00094, false negative rate (fnr) of 0.00395 and true positive rate (tpr) of 0.99605. the secfedidm-v1 can be deployed alongside firewalls in a federated cloud computing environment to reinforce the security of the infrastructure."

7474546,Code to learn with Scratch? A systematic literature review,"the use of computer programming in k-12 spread into schools worldwide in the 70s and 80s of the last century, but it disappeared from the educational landscape in the early 90s. with the development of visual programming languages such as scratch, this movement has emerged again in recent years, as teachers at all educational levels and from different disciplines consider that the use of programming enhances learning in many subjects and allows students to develop important skills. the systematic literature review presented in this article aims to summarize the results of recent research using programming with scratch in subjects not related to computing and communications, as well as studies analyzing the kind of skills students develop while learning to code in this environment. although the analyzed papers provide promising results regarding the use of programming as an educational resource, this review highlights the need to conduct more empirical research in classrooms, using larger samples of students that allow to obtain clear conclusions about the types of learning that could be enhanced through programming."

9127262,Coding Strip: A Pedagogical Tool for Teaching and Learning Programming Concepts through Comics,"the abstract nature of programming makes learning to code a daunting undertaking for many novice learners. in this work, we advocate the use of comicsa medium capable of presenting abstract ideas in a concrete, familiar wayfor introducing programming concepts. particularly, we propose a design process and related tools to help students and teachers create coding strips, a form of comic strips that are associated with a piece of code. we conducted two design workshops with students and high school computer science teachers to evaluate our design process and tools. we find that our design process and tools are effective at supporting the design of coding strips and that both students and teachers are excited about using coding strip as a tool for learning and teaching programming concepts."
7426241,Collaboration and Gender Equity in Game-Based Learning for Middle School Computer Science,"game-based learning environments can deliver robust learning gains and have a significant capacity to engage students. yet, they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior game experience. this article presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can effectively address this problem at the middle school level. in an iterative, designed-based research study, the authors first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the engage game-based learning environment and then deployed engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at supporting all students during computer science learning. in early phases of the intervention, male students outpaced female peers in learning gains. however, female students caught up during a multiweek classroom implementation. these findings provide evidence that gender differences could dissipate over time within collaborative game-based learning experiences in computer science."
8725135,Engaging Students in Computer Science Education through Game Development with Unity,"learning how to code by creating video games promises high motivation, engagement and fun for the students. in this study, the unity game development environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. the research design for the game development activities followed a design-based research approach. the learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support collaboration amongst the students. the results of the first iteration of design-based research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. from the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like unity in secondary education. besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. this seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games."
8615190,Effectiveness of Physical Robot Versus Robot Simulator in Teaching Introductory Programming,"this study reports the use of a physical robot and robot simulator in an introductory programming course in a university and measures students programming background conceptual learning gain and learning experience. one group used physical robots in their lessons to complete programming assignments, while the other group used robot simulators. we are interested in finding out if there is any difference in the learning gain and experiences between those that use physical robots as compared to robot simulators. our results suggest that there is no significant difference in terms of students learning between the two approaches. however, the control group that uses the physical robot shows a more positive response in their attitudes towards computing. we discuss the implications of our findings in relation to engaging students and challenges in using physical robots from the learner perspectives and ways to alleviate this. finally, by considering the insights from students comments, we also suggest an alternative that may give both benefits of using both physical robots and robot simulators."
8956465,Robot Analytics: What Do Human-Robot Interaction Traces Tell Us About Learning?,"in this paper, we propose that the data generated by educational robots can be better used by applying learning analytics methods and techniques which can lead to a deeper understanding of the learners apprehension and behavior as well as refined guidelines for roboticists and improved interventions by the teachers. as a step towards this, we put forward analyzing behavior and task performance at team andor individual levels by coupling robot data with the data from conventional methods of assessment through quizzes. classifying learnersteams in the behavioral feature space with respect to the task performance gives insight into the behavior patterns relevant for high performance, which could be backed by feature ranking. as a use case, we present an open-ended learning activity using tangible haptic-enabled cellulo robots in a classroom-level setting. the pilot study, spanning over approximately an hour, is conducted with 25 children in teams of two that are aged between 11-12. a linear separation is observed between the high and low performing teams where two of the behavioral features, namely number of distinct attempts and the visits to the destination, are found to be important. although the pilot study in its current form has limitations, e.g. its low sample size, it contributes to highlighting the potential of the use of learning analytics in educational robotics."
8615288,Seeking the Treasures of Theoretical Computer Science Education: Towards Educational Virtual Reality for the Visualization of Finite State Machines,"as metaphorical representations showed beneficial effects on several parts of computer science, this paper focuses on the question: how can metaphorical representations in vr enhance the understanding of theoretical computer science concepts a concept for an immersive educational virtual environment for learning the theoretical computer science concept of finite state machines is presented. a first draft for the virtual reality aims to immerse students in a world of islands (states) with treasure islands (final states). each symbol from the input alphabet is illustrated through another boat on every island. students navigate through the islands by looking at one of the boats on the current island using a head-mounted-display. they then take the shipping route of the selected boat (the state-transition function) by pressing a button on a controller. the goal of the game can either be to reach treasure island and open the treasure chest or to complete the map."
7296496,Leveraging collaboration to improve gender equity in a game-based learning environment for middle school computer science,"game-based learning environments can deliver robust learning gains and also have a unique capacity to engage students. yet they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior gaming experience. this is especially concerning in computer science education, as certain underrepresented groups (such as female students) may on average have less prior experience with games. this paper presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can successfully address this problem at the middle school level. in an iterative, designed-based research study, we first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the engage game-based learning environment, and then deployed engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at serving all students. in earlier phases of the intervention, male students outpaced their female peers in learning gains. however, female students caught up during a multi-week classroom implementation. these findings provide evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach may, over time, compensate for gender differences in experience and lead to equitable learning experiences within game-based learning environments for computer science education."
9195777,The Best Laid Plans or Lack Thereof: Security Decision-Making of Different Stakeholder Groups,"cyber security requirements are influenced by the priorities and decisions of a range of stakeholders. board members and chief information security officers (cisos) determine strategic priorities. managers have responsibility for resource allocation and project management. legal professionals concern themselves with regulatory compliance. little is understood about how the security decision-making approaches of these different stakeholders contrast, and if particular groups of stakeholders have a better appreciation of security requirements during decision-making. are risk analysts better decision makers than cisos do security experts exhibit more effective strategies than board members this paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a teams cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets. using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). we find that no group of experts makes significantly better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work."
9273959,Developing a Critical Robot Literacy for Young People from Conceptual Metaphors Analysis,"this research-to-practice full paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. this study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. it takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. the first activity involved the robots beebot, bluebot and ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. the second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. they designed, built and programmed a robot. young peoples representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of lakoff and jonhson. three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. a metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. it is then essential to deconstruct young peoples representations of the machine. this can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions."
7881360,Making CS Inclusive: An Overview of Efforts to Expand and Diversify CS Education,"computer science (cs) seems to be everywhere - in our smartphones, apps, cars, watches and so much more. it is integrated into almost every discipline and has a growing importance in our daily lives, yet even with top salaries, exciting companies, and promising careers, the job market remains underpopulated and under-representative of women. though its applications are everywhere, cs is an often misunderstood field due to lack of exposure and knowledge. this paper explores the misperception associated with computer science and examines the efforts to make it more inclusive by attracting women, introducing cs earlier at the k-12 level, and improving entry-level college courses."
9125219,Visual block programming languages and their use in educational robotics,"visual block programming environments can be defined as those programming environments that rely on objects rather than words to code the program. these types of environments are characterized by facilitating the task of the people who carry out the programs. this is mainly since they are more visually friendly. in addition, with this type of environment the person who makes the programs will not get the famous syntactic errors that characterize the programming tasks with textual programming languages. along this paper, a set of tools commonly used in educational robotics are showed. furthermore, a deep analysis in two of these tools are detailed. additionally, some educational scenarios are detailed, as long as their relationship to students competencies and how to drive the scenarios in order to accomplish with the competencies. finally, a study of the results from experience is included."

9272418,NYC CS4All: An Early Look at Teacher Implementation in One Districtwide Initiative,"computer science for all initiatives have broadened the participation of students enrolled in elective computer science (cs) courses and introduced compulsory cs instruction in many areas of the united states. however, there is a shortage of k-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach cs. to build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only cs content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. in this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple cs professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. the teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement cs. though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for cs education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing cs, in a large, urban school system. the results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement cs in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering cs instruction (even in a district where cs education is a priority). they also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. these differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing cs for all initiatives."
9028393,Connections and Influences Among Topics of Learning How to Program,"this full paper of innovative practice research shows results that could help to avoid some challenges faced by those who seek to learn how to program. to help improve learning, educators need a deep understanding of the obstacles students must overcome; otherwise, teaching strategies will be uncertain. moreover, a shallow understanding of topics learned in introductory programming courses can negatively influence the learning of future topics. with the above motivation, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with instructors who teach introductory programming courses and we also collected diaries kept by 110 students during their studies. the qualitative analysis of these data revealed connections between the studied contents such as dependencies. our analysis shows that many difficulties arise from the incorrect application of the knowledge necessary in learning new content, usually because the student has not learned earlier topics or learned them superficially. the main contribution of this paper is a theory that describes the connections among topics of learning how to program, showing the influence that knowledge about one can have on others."
9454149,Using Augmented Reality in programming learning: A systematic mapping study,"coding skills have become the new language of communication for the tech world. at an educational level, applying the concepts and logic of programming is a complex task for the student. the investigation of this problem was carried out with the intention of knowing if there are tools that could help the student understand programming by using augmented reality technology. for this purpose, a systematic mapping study was carried out to identify, filter and classify the information through a query applied in different ways of research. as a result, 34 articles were selected and classified. the main results show that: a) programming learning is not limited in terms of the students age; b) augmented reality has potential advantages in programming learning; c) due to the extensive content of the programming, applications focused on specific topics were found according to the level of studies; d) the software used in the development of ar applications, mostly uses unity with vuforia; and, e) augmented reality contributes to different learning techniques and styles that improve the way information is perceived and visualized. in conclusion, augmented reality technology has proven to have positive consequences in the programming learning process, providing a starting point for the development of a tool that contributes to the programming learning based on the characteristics found and analyzed in this document."
9028612,Using Visualization to Reduce the Cognitive Load of Threshold Concepts in Computer Programming,"this full paper in the research to practice category reports on an empirical empirical study in which novel educational tools and techniques were employed to teach fundamentals of problem decomposition - a cognitive task transcending disciplines. within the discipline of computer science, problem decomposition is recognized as a foundational activity of software development. factors that contribute to the complexity of this activity include: (1) recognizing patterns within an algorithm, (2) mapping the understanding of an algorithm to the syntax of a given programming language, and (3) complexity intrinsic to the problem domain itself. cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. in the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students cognitive load. novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain. performance on outcome measures (a quiz and assignment) were compared between the new method and the traditional teaching method demonstrated that students were significantly more successful at demonstrating mastery when using the new instructional method."
9648320,Massive Remote School Trips: A Case Study,"during the height of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, schools throughout europe have been closed for several months, leaving teachers with the responsibility of providing distance learning through video conferencing and remote-presence systems, while parents were scrambling for appropriate tools and support. school outings have also suffered from the limited mobility of students given by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. in this paper we present a set of technologies developed to reproduce the school trip experience, allowing students to stay at home or in school and requiring only a web browser and internet access, while integrating communication tools that allow participants to actively be engaged in interactive lessons and educational experiences. in 2020 the tool has been used during the codytrip event, a two-day visit to the town of urbino, attended by more than 15.000 students, followed up with a series of events in 2021 with over 115.000 participants. results from the pilot events show very high engagement and demonstrate the feasibility of organizing online visiting experiences with massive participation without compromising the perceived interactivity of the proposed activities, which can be equally engaging for different audience demographics. findings also suggest that this solution may be adopted not only as a contingent substitute for traveling during the pandemic, but as an effective tool to widen the scope and appeal of cultural tourism."
9249431,Empirical Evidence of the Usage of Programming Languages in the Educational Process,"contribution: a systematic literature review on the empirical evidence regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is presented. the review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. background: learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. this is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. research questions: 1) what empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (epls) 2) in what context is the research performed 3) how is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying epls 4) what pedagogical goals are achieved by using epls methodology: following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. a total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. findings: after performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of epls. some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-weird (western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts."
8070426,Difficulties of Programming Learning from the Point of View of Students and Instructors,"computer programming courses are mandatory for many majors. however, the high rate of failures shows that students have difficulties in assimilating the topics. the objective of this research is to understand these difficulties. analyzing diaries filled out by students and interviews with instructors, we identified difficulties related to language and understanding and some strategies used to mitigate them. the analysis and understanding of the difficulties may support the creation of teaching strategies and tools to facilitate the teaching and learning of computer programming."
9637325,SE-First: A New Approach to Software Engineering Education,"in this innovative practice full paper, we note that the way software is developed has changed significantly in the past 50 years. software developers today cannot just be good at writing code; they must also possess non-technical skills in order to work successfully within diverse teams and have an appreciation for the tools and processes needed to build and maintain complex systems. in this work, we describe a novel first-year software engineering-first (se-first) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. to assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. we assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a d or f course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program."

6960872,Polar Codes: Speed of Polarization and Polynomial Gap to Capacity,"we prove that, for all binary-input symmetric memoryless channels, polar codes enable reliable communication at rates within an additive gap varepsilon 0 to the shannon capacity with a block length, construction complexity, and decoding complexity, all bounded by a polynomial in 1 varepsilon . polar coding gives the first known explicit construction with rigorous proofs of all these properties; previous constructions were not known to achieve capacity with less than exp (1 varepsilon ) decoding complexity except for erasure channels. we establish the capacity-achieving property of polar codes via a direct analysis of the underlying martingale of conditional entropies, without relying on the martingale convergence theorem. this step gives rough polarization (noise levels approx varepsilon for the good channels), which can then be adequately amplified by tracking the decay of the channel bhattacharyya parameters. our effective bounds imply that polar codes can have block length (and encodingdecoding complexity) bounded by a polynomial in 1 varepsilon . the generator matrix of such polar codes can be constructed in polynomial time by algorithmically computing an adequate approximation of the polarization process."
7365445,Capacity of Non-Malleable Codes,"non-malleable codes, introduced by dziembowski et al., encode messages s in a manner, so that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output s or a message that is independent of s. while this is an impossible goal to achieve against unrestricted tampering functions, rather surprisingly non-malleable coding becomes possible against every fixed family p of tampering functions that is not too large (for instance, when ii 22n for some ; 1, where n is the number of bits in a codeword). in this paper, we study the capacity of non-malleable codes, and establish optimal bounds on the achievable rate as a function of the family size, answering an open problem from dziembowski et al. specifically, we prove that for every family p with ifi ii 22n, there exist non-malleable codes against p with rate arbitrarily close to 1- this is achieved with high probability (w.h.p.) by a randomized construction. we show the existence of families of size exp(no(1)2n) against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 - (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size). we also show that 1 - is the best achievable rate for the family of functions, which are only allowed to tamper the first n bits of the codeword, which is of special interest. as a corollary, this implies that the capacity of non-malleable coding in the split-state model (where the tampering function acts independently but arbitrarily on the two halves of the codeword, a model which has received some attention recently) equals 12. we also give an efficient monte carlo construction of codes of rate close to 1 with polynomial time encoding and decoding that is non-malleable against any fixed c 0 and family p of size 2nc, in particular tampering functions with, say, cubic size circuits."
9576399,Removing the Walls Around Visual Educational Programming Environments,"many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. however, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue http requests. but in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. this paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the internet of things, and cybersecurity to novices. by thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. the paper presents netsblox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing."
8907854,Modeling and Analysis of First Aid Command and Dispatching System of Cloud Medical System,"nowadays, with the phenomenon of the world ageing getting serious, the demand for intelligent medical treatment becomes higher than past. a series of smart bracelets have been launched for the health of the elderly, which can detect the health condition of the elderly in real-time. when an abnormal phenomenon occurs and the rescue will be needed, it can transmit the signal to the medical platform of the hospital or the mobile phone of its guardian, and then the hospital would send an ambulance and relevant doctors to rescue the patient. this paper mainly studies the starting bracelet sensors to collect data to rescue behavior of the entire process, proposes a petri net model of distributed resource allocation based on cloud medical system. through the structural analysis of the model and the construction of the algorithm, the rationality and efficiency of the whole system model are verified, and the case study shows that the model can effectively find the optimal scheduling path and each part of the system can respond well."
10636140,Navigating the Pitfalls: Analyzing the Behavior of LLMs as a Coding Assistant for Computer Science Students—A Systematic Review of the Literature,"in recent years, large language models (llms) have been employed significantly in different domains of computing education. nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. however, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing llm behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. this article addresses this gap systematically and details how different llm-based coding chatbots, such as chatgpt, codex, copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. to achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. these objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. the findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. these limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness. the finding also reports multiple research directions that can be considered in future research related to llms in computing education."
7739687,Skill progression in MIT app inventor,"this paper contributes to the growing body of research that attempts to measure online, informal learning. we analyze skill progression in mit app inventor, an informal online learning environment with over 5 million users and 15.9 million projectsapps created. our objective is to understand how people learn computational thinking concepts while creating mobile applications with app inventor. in particular, we are interested in the relationship between the progression of skill in using app inventor functionality and in using computational thinking concepts as learners create more apps. we model skill progression along two dimensions: breadth and depth of capability. given a sample of 10,571 random users who have each created at least 20 apps, we analyze the relationship between demonstrating domain-specific skills by using app inventor functionality and generalizable skills by using computational thinking concepts. our findings indicate that domain-specific and generalizable skills progress similarly; there is a common pattern of expanding breadth of capability by using new skills over the first 10 projects, then developing depth of capability by using previously introduced skills to build more sophisticated apps."
7296518,Employing narratives to trigger interest in computational activities with inner-city girls,"there has been a well-documented and persistent drop in the number of women in computer science and engineering courses 1. young peoples decisions about participation often start early and have been linked to particular experiences 2. for some young people, these experiences are less than encouraging. in the us, high school computer science courses are overwhelmingly male dominated 3. schools serving minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle to even offer such classes 4. even when opportunities exist, many girls and underrepresented populations face barriers such as negative stereotypes and dearth of role models and community 5. the digital youth divas program was created to address these issues through intentional design. the program is developed to trigger situational interest 6 in girls through a combination of community, project-based instruction, on- and offline learning spaces, and narrative stories. triggered situational interest is critical as an opening to move on to subsequent phases that are more independent of environmental factors. understanding potential effective triggers for girls, minorities, and youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds is critical to engaging such populations in stem learning. (1) community: middle school girls interested in fashion and design are recruited, especially from areas that have traditionally been underserved. adult mentors who are not engineers, but share cultural connections with the girls and have gone through curriculum and pedagogical training, attend to specific practices of encouraging, helping to troubleshoot, and developing community. (2) project-based instruction: the program combines principles of fashion, design, and dance with the power and possibilities of electronic circuits and programming to develop interactive e-fashion projects and virtual programmed choreographies. scaffolded challenges work through stages of design and computational thinking, including paper prototyping, implementation, feedback, and revision. (3) integrated on and offline learning spaces: girls work through projects in a shared physical space using supplied materials. an online system, iremix, is the mechanism for independent work and leveling up. (4) interactive narrative stories: narratives can provide context that helps relate abstract concepts to real-world issues 7, increase motivation and positively contribute to girls science identity 8, and provide focus for design by communicating tasks, specifically when readers can identify with the stories 9. compelling stories conveyed in text and multimedia (video, audio, images) is employed to engage middle school girls in activities involving computational thinking. the stories center on a group of middle school girls involved in the digital youth divas program, and combines aspects of contemporary young adult fiction (mystery, social and emotional issues) with content, topics, and project work from the e-textiles and programming curricula. the interactive narratives unfold through the iremix platform: girls launch narratives and at intervals are prompted to engage in project-based work. the girls solve challenges by submitting work online, and receive and respond to messages from characters. our early exploratory research suggested that narratives prompted discussions of identity, and contributed to participant interest in the program content and motivation to engage in project work."
4402039,Human Being Properties of Saplings Growing up Algorithm,"the human culture and cognition are consequence of the thinking capability of human, and thinking is a social activity. people have similar idea and opinion interacts, and interactions force people to have similar idea and interaction take place locally. however, its effect is global. in this study, we try to determine define the computational thinking for saplings growing up algorithm (sgua) which belongs to evolutionary algorithms. thinking capability can be defined based on the process interaction for similar solutions. sgua has four operators: mating, branching, vaccinating and surviving. we determined the computational thinking capability for each operator. finally, we determined computational thinking capability of sgua."
9962737,Interdisciplinary Computing Education: An Introductory Programming and Data Science Course for Postdoctoral Researchers in the Biosciences,"this innovative-practice full paper presents the curriculum development of an introductory course in programming and data science for postdoctoral researchers (pdrs) in the biosciences. the use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. however, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for pdrs in biology and medicine. the primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in pdrs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. this course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either python or r - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. further, pdrs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in python or r. we also report the feedback from the enrolled pdrs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education."
5508834,Transforming the Instruction of Introductory Computing to Engineering Students,"computer science as a discipline encompasses the study and creation of computational techniques for problem-solving. unfortunately, much of the benefit of these techniques to engineering students is lost in translation, in part due to the disconnect between introductory computing courses and the disciplinary courses that introduce problems that could benefit from computational techniques. a considerable body of literature has documented the ineffectiveness of traditional programming courses in transferring usable knowledge to students, specifically where problem-solving skills and computational thinking are concerned. this paper describes a transformative change to the instruction of introductory computing to engineering students, in the context of a single non-major course. in the proposed architecture, a core lecture is supplemented with plug-in domain-specific modules and problems that are presented in domain-specific recitationlaboratory sections. the focus of the lecture component of the course is to introduce the core concepts and skills required for computational thinking, including algorithms and software engineering techniques. the recitationlaboratory component encourages and guides the application of these skills to introductory problems in engineering. the objective is to shift the emphasis from the minutia of the syntax of textual programming languages to computational thinking."
6826147,Use of cutting edge educational tools for an initial programming course,"programming skills are an important component of an engineering curriculum, not only because they enable the customization of software tools to be used in the profession, but also (and perhaps more crucially) because of the computational thinking and problem solving capabilities that are ideally developed by young students who learn to program for the first time. the necessity to expand the computing curriculum across a wider range of schools and university courses for students who are not majoring in computer science (cs) ) it is well-documented in literature 1, as is the difficulty of teaching 21st century skills (www.p21.org. this work presents an educational approach to teaching initial programming based on the development of fundamental and transversal skills and computer science skills, including creative and computational thinking as well as problem solving and critical thinking. the approach is based on cutting-edge educational tools, namely the visual programming frameworks scratch, appinventor, byob, and the well-known cc language; curriculum material is drawn from csprinciples pilot courses, cs unplugged, school level preparation material for the international olympiad in informatics, and are complemented by supplementary information. the pedagogical approaches used in the course are based on constructivist learning theory, experiential learning and guided inquiry. this paper presents a year-long teaching experience in a 10th13th grade high school with 14 to 16-year-old students. ways to extend the experience to a university course are also presented. an initial analysis of the course results, both qualitative (based on two student surveys) and quantitative (based on formal written examinations) is presented and discussed. results are encouraging, showing how visual programming languages help students to improve their problems solving skills and reasoning practices. exposing the younger generation to computational concepts is fundamental in order to improve the mastering of these concepts and increase the success rate in university studies."
7044089,"""AliCe-ViLlagE"" Alice as a Collaborative Virtual Learning Environment","there is a growing literature demonstrating the importance of collaboration and teamwork in the process of learning computational thinking and the foundational aspects of computer science. while collaborative virtual environments are becoming widespread in the software development professional domain and in various areas of advanced learning, their use in the introductory stages of learning computing is still very limited. on the other hand, in recent years, there has been a blooming of attractive programming environments specifically designed to expose young students (e.g., middle school age) to computational thinking. alice is a very popular introductory programming environment, focused on programming through animations and story-telling. this paper introduces a novel extension of the alice framework that enables interaction and collaboration among students in the development of programs. in particular, the new version of alice described in this paper provides support for virtual pair programming. the modified version of alice allows two students to remotely share a virtual world, and interact in its construction; the system supports roles assignments, to allow teachers to control activities and contributions of the two students in the creation of a programming project."
7760705,Interactive learning environment for practical programming language based on web service,"as the needs of education of programming language increase, the importance of the learning environment has been emphasized. based on the social trends, various web services for the education of programming which improves the computational thinking of a student. among the web services, block-based programming languages are well known as an effective educational tool for a primary student though a freshman in the university. these tools are proven to be useful tools since the tools provide same programming environment to the students and the teachers anytime and anywhere. however, the environments may be insufficient for learning practical programming languages, such as cc and java, because they are not the block-based programming languages. this paper introduces a block-based learning environment for c programming language using web services. the environment fills the gap between building computational thinking and learning the syntax of the programming language. the programming environment provides the equivalent environment to teachers and the students during the programming hands-on."
8511891,An Automated Evaluation System for App Inventor Apps,"more and more k-12 schools are paying attention to the training of computational thinking. a considerable amount of k-12 use blocked-based visual programming platforms such as scratch, app inventor, alice and etc. mit app inventor is one of the more popular mobile application visualization programming platforms. visual programming is based on the you see what you get doctrine. its simplicity and ease of use coheres with k-12 teaching principles and allows students to access to computational thinking without the burden of learning coding grammar. recently app inventor is gaining momentum and traction in china at a very high speed and is expected to grow even faster in the future. teachers using app inventor for teaching face the problem of having to go through a very high number of app inventor apps without any way to catalogue them. the 2017 google app inventor competition alone received over 1300 entries. this article aims to devise an automated scoring method based on tf-idf and clustering to help teachers evaluate app inventor apps, thus greatly reducing their workload. evaluating the method gives us an 75.42 with space for further improvement in the future."
9481012,Bluetooth Communications in Educational Robotics,"in a world in a continuous and rapid change, it is absolutely necessary for our students to keep up with the rapid progress of new technologies: internet of things (iot), robotics, artificial intelligence (ai), virtual reality (vr), augmented reality (ar) etc. the rapid evolution and diversification of these emerging technologies has recently led to their introduction into the educational offer of the school curriculum for the gymnasium. the discipline of information and communication technology (ict) has already been implemented, a discipline that involves both the formation of skills to use new technologies and the formation of computational thinking necessary for the efficient and intelligent use of these technologies. in order to teach and learn physics from a stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) educational perspective, we initiated optional school courses of iot, robotics and ai (approached through machine learning). these courses stimulate, at the level of students, computational thinking, creativity and innovation and lead, from an interdisciplinary perspective, to the development of emerging specializations such as mathematics-physics-automation, mathematics-physics-electronics, mathematics-physics-informatics-robotics etc. in this paper we presented a method of approaching, in the school educational space, the study of wireless communication technologies between smart devices, through an educational robotics project. the project consisted of creating a wireless controlled mobile robotic platform (robot car) via a bluetooth module connected to an arduino uno board."
9273818,Tracking Representational Flexibility Development through Speech Data Mining,"in this work-in-progress research we exploited and investigated a virtual reality (vr) based, flexibility learning environment (fle) in which adolescents with autism use, customize, and design an assortment of simulation games that represent and exemplify the application of forces and newtons laws of motion. the simulationgame modeling and making tasks acted as the primers of practicing and assessing representational flexibility in solving the engineering design problems with computational thinking. the participants participation behaviors and verbal utterances during the intervention sessions have been archived via screen and webcam recordings. the current study findings indicated that two approaches of speech or text data mining, multi-label classification and similarity index, can act as the in-situ performance assessment methods to evaluate the representational flexibility development for engineering design and computational thinking of a heterogeneous learner group."
10343283,Coding Like a Data Miner: A Sandbox Approach to Computing-Based Data Science for High School Student Learning,"personal health tracking devices and internet-based digital platforms with the capacity to collect, aggregate, and store data at massive scales are examples of tools that have broadened priorities in computing to include data science. in response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. this is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like cs4all, code.org, bootstrap: data science, exploring computer science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand big data. this is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. this is further complicated by the persistent shortage of k-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. to address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like scratch and electronic textiles (e-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. the literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. this latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. in this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, coding like a data miner (cldm)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. in this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students access, analyze and make sense of big data sets of their own. we collaborated with high school teachers in a west texaspaso del norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) what affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners (2) which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out cldm activities, (3) which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in cldm (4) how do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in cldm we use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions."
8985981,Providing Equitable Access to Computing Education in Mississippi,"to maintain competitiveness as a nation, the united states must broaden participation in computing education and career pathways. integrating computational thinking and computer science in k-12 classrooms is becoming increasingly essential to the development of a responsible and innovative workforce. further, with increased recognition of the need for computing competency, workforce development programs that target the emerging workforce that may not be on a college pathway and those citizens who want to retool for the digital economy are also essential. this study examines work by researchers and practitioners in mississippi to engage all public school students and the workforce with computational thinking, computer science concepts, and cybersecurity, providing pathways for learning that make computing education accessible for all citizens. the state of mississippi has the lowest median wage in the nation, and one of the lowest rates of stem employment. with half of the public school children identified as african american, and half of them female, there is much opportunity for broadening participation in computing. assessments from a k-12 teacher professional development programs will be discussed, in addition to outcomes from one year of a workforce development program."
10578608,How Various Educational Features Influence Programming Performance in Primary School Education,"in the digital age, programming education has become increasingly important, even in primary schools. however, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. educational data mining (edm) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. a notable gap in the current literature about edm in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students programming capabilities. a more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. we found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in information technology, followed by psychometric data on students learning attitudes and motivation. computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. its worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like olympic mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. this is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success."

8190558,Learning Java in a New York City immigrant engineer retraining program,"this research explores the psychology of programming and the pedagogical environment in a certificate granting urban immigrant engineer retraining program in new york city. the program is aimed at teaching under-represented immigrant engineer students to learn how to program in the java programming language. the programming concepts and the fostered pedagogical environment were implemented in three-hour evening sessions over 15 weeks in which the students were encouraged to develop programming communities while working on computational thinking concept strands. the research findings that we report are threefold. first, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. we found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning java. our findings provide unique insights into intervention constraints for an urban retraining program which can be used to guide and inform further retraining computer learning program research."
10343256,Enculturation of Students to Engineering and COVID's Impact Associated,"enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as asee or ieee. enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. this culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. an approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. this model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. during the spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a u.s. southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of covid on engineering students. eight likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). the model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematicalphysical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmiccomputational thinking. additional likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of covid on their educational experience. the research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) how are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications, and (b) how is enculturation associated with the covid impact on students preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 15 and 7) increase by students school classification. this means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 15 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. in terms of the perceived impact of covid, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact the factors were ethics and algorithmiccomputational thinking. in other words, the worse the students perception of covids impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. while these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. the researchers expect to engage the fie community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model."

9388156,8 Computational Heterogeneity: A Radical Reflection,"in experience and education, dewey argued that humankind is given to formulating its beliefs in terms of either-ors, between which it recognizes no intermediate possibilities. not surprisingly, educational computing is no exception. one such either-or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 a keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator judy robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational thinking as the centerpiece of computational literacy. focusing only on creating scratch programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a machine. childrens drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the k-12 levelssuch as variables and loopsdoes not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. what gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and softwareand many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing."
10869207,Gamification Elements in Virtual Simulation Integrated Learning: A Quantitative Evaluation with the 5E Instructional Model,"programming and robot building are two crucial components in an ai curriculum, while students learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement are important dimensions to measure students learning outcomes. in previous teaching practice, virtual simulation platforms are often used as teaching aids, and the operational difficulty of the platforms may reduce students interest in learning, thus lowering the learning effect. therefore, based on the 5e teaching model, this study combines gamification elements with virtual simulation integrated learning to explore its effects on the three dimensions of students learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement."

9668057,Intelligent Traffic Light System Using Image Processing,"nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. the traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. it is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. the organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. the paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. lazarus and opengl were used to program based on pascal language. the software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. it is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. this investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35. in addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. the project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of stem education with using iot and artificial intelligence."
7344376,Virtual experiments for introduction of computing: Using virtual reality technology,"introduction to computing is a public course for the first-year non-major undergraduate students, aiming at training students for the abilities in computer science and technology with computational thinking. however, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. as computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. in this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. for example, turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. however, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of turing machine and understand the related concepts. another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. however, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. therefore, 3d modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of china since 2013. the evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing."

9274139,First steps into STEM for young pupils through informal workshops,"in this work in progress paper we present an example of innovative practice in organizing informal stem education workshops with young children. the workshops were divided into two learning scenarios, unplugged programming and hands-on robot play. unplugged programming encourages understanding of the core concepts of programming such as algorithms and computational thinking rather than focusing on the programming language. in the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - thymio and codey rocky. the aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. the pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. the post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops. combining unplugged activities with robots helps bridging the gap between imagination and reality, therefore improving learning."
8120407,Authoring feedback for novice programmers in a block-based language,"we present a block-based language for specifying feedback to novice learners about the programs they are constructing in a block-based programming language. in addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). a feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the students block program for a given problem. the paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level computational thinking class. the feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in blockpy, a dual blocktext programming environment for a subset of python."
6684986,Can utilizing social media and visual programming increase retention of minorities in programming classes?,"this paper discusses how social digital literacy is being used in cs1 to teach critical and computational thinking by delivering content to students through the use of social media. social digital literacy (sdl) is the way in which people use social media to enhance their social network, effectively increase their knowledge base, while communicating clearly and professionally through the use of social media. the increased popularity of social media amongst college students makes it an opportune time to consider a new form of literacy based on how technology is used by students, the devices that students interact with on a daily bases and the mainstream acceptance of social media in daily life. in order to retain students in computing classes, students are taught in an efficacious manner how to capitalize on the technology that they use on a daily basis. by increasing their sdl proficiency to become a more informed student, a well versed employee and consciously aware of what they post to social media. the expectation is that the approach being used can be implemented in any introductory programming course."

8970131,An Ontology based approach to teach Computational Thinking,"this paper is focused on the teachinglearning process of computational thinking at primary and secondary schools. it is generally accepted that programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. however, teaching computer programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. to overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in computer science is defending the importance of teaching computational thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an ontology (ontocne) that describes in detail the concepts computational thinking and programming, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. we believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. so a main investment to educate people in computational thinking is on the choicecreation of those convenient resources. in particular we intended to investigate the impact of augmented reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. in that direction we will also discuss the development of a web platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. on the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level."

7930065,Automated Personalized Feedback in Introductory Java Programming MOOCs,"currently, there is a boom in introductory programming courses to help students develop their computational thinking skills. providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. however, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in massive open online courses (moocs), prove this task a challenge. one solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. automatic techniques focus on: a) functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices, b) software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors, and c) comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. this paper presents a semantic-aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions. these snippets are modeled as subgraph patterns with natural language feedback attached to them. submissions are transformed into extended program dependence graphs combining control and data flows. we leverage subgraph matching techniques to compute the adequate personalized feedback. also, constraints correlating patterns allow performing fine-grained assessments. we have evaluated our method on several introductory programming assignments and a large number of submissions. our technique delivered personalized feedback in milliseconds using a small set of patterns, which makes it appealing in real-world settings."

9163380,A Computation Model for Learning Programming and Emotional Intelligence,"introducing coding in early education improves the logical and computational thinking in kids. however, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. the current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. in our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. however, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. this research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kids emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. we proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. the model provides a curriculum and related tools. for evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. these students were divided into five groups (a, b, c, d, and e), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. the children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. the research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface."
9661274,"Novelette, a Usable Visual Storytelling Digital Learning Environment","educational digital storytelling is widely recognised as a powerful approach in developing literary skills, experiencing problem-solving and computational thinking, information and knowledge visualisation, building creativity and divergent thinking supported by technological solutions. however, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. the main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone elses story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. this paper focuses on the assessment of novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. as a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. results demonstrate that novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the system usability scale, a.k.a., sus, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. we can conclude that novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity."
7942991,How can a simulation game support the development of computational problem-solving strategies?,"game-based learning using interactive environments to impart theoretical and applied knowledge for introductory programming courses is divided in two popular approaches: game making and game playing. various studies have been conducted following greatly the former approach in secondary and tertiary education with controversial results. however, there has been relatively little research shown about how game playing can be associated with the development of computational thinking and how fundamental programming concepts can be supported by playing games. this work investigates how a simulation game should be designed to support the development of computational problem-solving strategies through the medium of learning fundamental computer science concepts, by proposing a theoretical game playing framework."
9637460,My Robot can tell stories: Introducing robotics and physical computing to children using dynamic dioaramas,"from time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. rural children in india, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. the process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. in this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural india in a personally meaningful manner. children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the scratch programming language. they learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. the author observed that such an intervention improved the childrens sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. the author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in india on the childrens perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. the results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion."
9583623,Teaching and Learning Tools for Introductory Programming in University Courses,"difficulties in teaching and learning introductory programming have been studied over the years. the students difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. the problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. the main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. there are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. in this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. this work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities."
9006170,Extending the Scope of Computational Archival Science: A Case Study on Leveraging Archival and Engineering Approaches to Develop a Framework to Detect and Prevent “Fake Video”,"thousands of videos are posted online every day. the affordability of video editing tools and social networks has facilitated the creation and spread of videos carrying disinformation, i.e. fake videos. previous attempts to categorize disinformation have focused on content analysis and ascertaining the intention of creators. to extend these approaches, it is beneficial to incorporate the perspective of other fields that study the trustworthiness of records, such as archival science, to help detect and categorize fake videos. this paper proposes to leverage archival science in combination with computer engineering to devise a new framework for detecting and categorizing fake videos. in doing so, the paper offers a case study of the way in which computational archival science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake videos."
9125187,Effects of a Hackathon on the Motivation and Grades of CS1 Students,"many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. however, it is not always easy to engage non-cs students in coding. hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and cs in general. thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a cs1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades) in this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students grades. we discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. we also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of cs1 students."
9274172,Educational Pyramid Scheme – A Sustainable Way Of Bringing Innovations To School,"full paper. one of the biggest challenges in education is the transfer of innovations and new didactic approaches into the school system. to ensure a high standard of teaching, it is essential that the teachers expertise, pedagogical content knowledge as well as digital competences are continuously improved by further training. in-service training for teachers is offered in different settings (short-, middle- and long term), with advantages and disadvantages. two aspects that correlate positively are the costs and the sustainable outcome of these trainings. with these aspects in mind the educational pyramid scheme (eps) is currently being developed and implemented as part of an erasmus plus project. it is an innovative concept that aims at spreading new learning contents and methods in a relatively short time within the school system, with low costs and high effect. it is inspired by the economical pyramid scheme, which is designed to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities. the transaction content of the educational pyramid scheme refers to methods or strategies that are being exchanged, and to the resources and capabilities that are required to enable the exchange. according to a train-the-trainer principle, teachers and pupils will be qualified to be trainers, who then spread their knowledge and skills to people in their school and beyond. the eps contains three different functions or roles: multipliers (teachers and scientists), mentors (teachers) and tutors (pupils). the motivation to participate is maintained with a benefit system adapted for each target group. the training of target groups follows high qualitative standards and therefore presents different phases: input, practical phase and reflection. this paper describes the development of the eps and its first implementation in the framework of the austrian mandatory curriculum basic digital education including computational thinking and programming. it presents some qualitative results gained so far from interviews and observation, which are satisfactory and deliver good arguments for the further implementation of the eps."

8067823,Transdisciplinary learning in technology degrees,"this paper outlines a new kind of degree that has technology at its core, but is transdisciplinary in nature. rather than students learning knowledge in discrete disciplinary blocks, they are exposed to ideas and practices from a wide variety of disciplines, and use these to create new ways of working that are underpinned by capabilities in computational thinking, complex systems, data and reasoning."
10444509,Human-Centered Digital Sustainability: Handling Enumerated Lists in Digital Texts,"in advance to the present study, the authors introduced a method which makes it possible to calculate the entropy of natural language digital texts, focusing on word-processed texts, presentations, and webpages. this entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. it was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. this finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. to resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data generated by negligent text management. furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. to prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group ( 2times67 hours). with this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. to correct documents, we present the error recognition model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. all our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students and end-users computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability beyond hardware and software development and recycling with a focus on the human factor. recently, the error recognition model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. however, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate."
8659237,Reflecting on the Impact of a Course on Inclusive Strategies for Teaching Computer Science,"as the number of teachers teaching computer science grows, it is increasingly important to be mindful of the training they receive with respect to broadening participation in computer science. through our program, we have trained over 50 teachers in the greater boise metropolitan region, who have in turn taught over 1400 students computing concepts through courses such as exploring cs, ap cs principles, and ap cs a. these courses have an excellent curriculum that contains a mix of computational thinking concepts such as a focus on creativity, abstraction, coding, as well as increasing awareness about the cyber footprint of the students with respect to security and privacy. while the curriculum is excellent, we need to be more mindful about incorporating pedagogical strategies that promote inclusive teaching especially for women and minorities who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.to address the challenges associated with teaching a truly inclusive course, we developed a new course titled inclusive strategies for computer science education that draws attention to the strategies that have been studied over the years in stem and cs education literature. we present the contents of the course along with a post-hoc qualitative survey on the applicability and practicality of the material discussed in the course."
10139678,Hands-on Active Learning Approach to Teach Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning to Elementary and Middle School Students,"the last decade has seen a surge in expanding access to computer science (cs) education, especially for k-12, with many states even stipulating student learning standards in cs and computational thinking (ct). our 21st century k-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of cs and ct. at the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by artificial intelligence (ai). ai in the form of machine learning (ml) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. in higher education, aiml courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. to an extent, some high schools (grades 912) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. as for middle (grades 68) and elementary school (grades k-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. in this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate aiml lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. we want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs. we describe a detailed aiml lesson plan based on standards and framework, ai4k12 big ideas, art and science of curriculum design, active learning, and culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy. then we discuss our experiences in teaching the same to boldsymbol4mathbfth grade students in an elementary school."
8001845,An Exploratory Study on the Influence of Cognitive and Affective Characteristics in Programming-Based Making Activities,"programming-based making activities are at the core of teaching strategies to engage young students in learning programming for developing computational thinking skills. despite the initial evidences of enthusiastic participation in such activities, more systematic studies are needed to better understand drivers of students intentions to participate in programming-based making activities. in this paper, we present an exploratory study which aim to address this issue by examining the interrelations among cognitive (i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and affective (i.e., enjoyment) characteristics for both boys and girls. to this end, we build on complexity theory and configuration theory, present a conceptual model, and employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca) on a sample of 105 young students, to identify such interrelations. the findings provide insights on how the examined factors may have a different influence for boys and girls, an outcome that can be used to re-design educational programs targeting maximizing engagement regardless gender."
7344030,"Empowering teachers to teach CS — Exploring a social constructivist approach for CS CPD, using the Bridge21 model","this paper describes current research exploring the adaption of the bridge21 pedagogical model for the provision of a computer science (cs) continuing professional development (cpd) programme for post-primaryhigh school teachers in the republic of ireland. this paper outlines the design of the programme and explores the delivery of two, week long cs cpd interventions delivered in the authors home institution over the summer of 2014. the interventions were designed to help teachers develop expertise in areas such as computational thinking, programming and game design, text based programming and hardware configuration. the bridge21 learning and activity models were used throughout each workshop delivery and teachers were invited to use the same models in their own delivery of cs classroom activities. an exploratory case study approach, using evaluation theory, informed data collection, coding and analysis procedures. teacher reactions towards the bridge21 cs cpd programme were investigated. analysis indicate that teacher reaction towards the programme was positive and that teachers intended to use elements of the bridge21 learning and activity model for cs delivery in the classroom."
8658572,Encouraging Women to Pursue a Computer Science Career in the Context of a Third World Country,"this innovative practice full paper presents a set of engaging actions aimed to encourage women to pursue a computer science career in a city of a third world country (manaus, brazil). despite worldwide efforts to promote gender equality, typically, women account for less than 30 of the workforce in technological areas. in third world countries, the situation is much more unbalanced. poor educational and economic conditions, allied with a chauvinism culture contaminated by sexism and stereotypes, are strong forces that repel the young girls from it areas. as a result, the percentage of women in local computer science majors is lower than expected. the authors detail a program to involve girls from all school levels in computer science career, which is indeed the adaptation of a national program, combined with indigenous elements. the mentioned adaptation was a key success factor to catch the attention of students and local educators. some activities that are included in this program are lectures at scientific, technological and gender discussion events, realization of dynamics in schools for the dissemination of computational thinking in children and young students, training students to take part in programming contests and develop knowledge into real computational applications. these actions resulted in highlights achieved in programming contests and prizes obtained through application development, and have provided a more conducive academic environment to discuss issues related to the female gender in science and technology fields. besides the fundamentals of the program, the authors present the results of the last three initiatives, which happened in conjunction with local events, and the promising opportunities perceived in computer science major of a local university."
10005170,Abstracted Power and Responsibility in Computer Science Ethics Education,"as computing becomes more powerful and extends the reach of those who wield it, the imperative grows for computing professionals to make ethical decisions regarding the use of that power. we propose the concept of abstracted power to help computer science students understand how technology may distance them perceptually from consequences of their actions. specifically, we identify technological intermediation and computational thinking as two factors in computer science that contribute to this distancing. to counter the abstraction of power, we argue for increased emotional engagement in computer science ethics education, to encourage students to feel as well as think regarding the potential impacts of their power on others. we suggest four concrete pedagogical approaches to enable this emotional engagement in computer science ethics curriculum, and we share highlights of student reactions to the material."
6220928,Development and Application of a Simulation Environment (NEO) for Integrating Empirical and Computational Investigations of System-Level Complexity,"network exchange objects (neo) is a new software framework designed to facilitate development of complex natural or built distributed system models, where the system model is represented as a graph, through which currencies (e.g., coding information) flux. this paper introduces system-level hypothesis (slh) testing as a form of computational thinking that will drive integration of computational and empirical sciences to promote efficient, self- correcting inquiry into the operations and behavior of complex systems. to demonstrate neo, we examine the problem of maximizing the productivity of a software development organization by measuring growth in the total lines of code (loc) contributed by developers. we develop a software framework (neo) that allows rapid creation of model variants representing alternative slhs. neo is designed to investigate systems we describe as complex adaptive hierarchical networks (cahns - complex systems represented as networks that route and store multiple interactive currencies). models built atop neo, are organized collections of individual values (model variables) and algorithms (model logic). modelers systematically combine algorithms to create alternative model formulations at runtime. thus, neo is a simulation framework that can be used in any domain of expertise, where systems are represented as interdependent entities that store and flux multiple currencies."
10143930,The Artificial Intelligence Learning Anxiety and Self-Efficacy of In-Service Teachers Taking AI Training Courses,"this research explored the degree of learning self-efficacy of machine learning experience (mlse) and artificial intelligence learning anxiety (aila) of elementary and junior high school teachers. the participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. this research applied the ai2 robot city, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. the learning content was image classification for ai application. elementary and junior high school teachers operated the mit app inventor(mai) and personal image classifier(pic) platform, and trained the model for practicing ai to implement supervised machine learning on the pic platform. the learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of mai. they completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the ai2 robot city board game. in order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the ai teacher training workshop, the mlse and aila scales were administered before and after the classes. a total of 28 samples were collected. the results showed that there was no significant difference between the mlse of the elementary and junior high school teachers. however, the average aila degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. it was found that aila was significantly negatively correlated with mlse. the elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study ai-related courses. however, the aila of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. therefore, more teacher training workshops on ai application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with ai application. future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their aila and mlse with time and as training courses increase."
9155812,A Machine Learning Platform for Multirotor Activity Training and Recognition,"machine learning is a new paradigm of problem solving. teaching machine learning in schools and colleges to prepare the industrys needs becomes imminent, not only in computing majors, but also in all engineering disciplines. this paper develops a new, hands-on approach to teaching machine learning by training a linear classifier and applying that classifier to solve multirotor activity recognition (mar) problems in an online lab setting. mar labs leverage cloud computing and data storage technologies to host a versatile environment capable of logging, orchestrating, and visualizing the solution for an mar problem through a user interface. this work extends arizona state universitys visual iotrobotics programming language environment (viple) as a control platform for multi-rotors used in data collection. viple is a platform developed for teaching computational thinking, visual programming, internet of things (iot) and robotics application development."
7760759,Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability,"spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. this is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. however in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. this limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, r1c1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. this paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. we propose that this concept is termed gradual structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. in this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. in programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. it is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. likewise gradual structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. the key language feature required to enable gradual structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. this concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-pasted in spreadsheets. moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. the ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. however these applications do not enable gradual structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet."
8102343,Introducing computer programming in secondary schools: A case study of NAMTOSS,"most countries in the southern africa development community (sadc) have adopted national development plans that recognize ict as the main driver for economic development. for ict to effectively contribute to the national development agenda however, there is a need to ensure that citizens are ict literate. as a result, a number of countries have developed subject policy guidelines aimed at introducing computer studies at secondary school level. while most of these guidelines are carefully crafted, actual implementation in secondary schools has proved troublesome; having under-maintained or non-existent ict infrastructures along with inadequately trained teachers as major obstacles. subsequently, most african students first exposure to computer programming occurs in the first year of university education, thus entering the computer science major without any prior hands-on experience. the namibian technology outreach to secondary schools (namtoss) initiative is a pilot program started by the school of computing (soc) at the university of namibia (unam) in march 2016. namtoss is a partnership between secondary school teachers, learners and the staff members of the school of computing at unam that is designed to introduce computer programming skills and computational thinking at secondary school level. namtoss attempts to address the structural and systemic issues raised by previously unsuccessful outreach efforts conducted in southern africa. in this paper, we enumerate the successes and failures of our initial outreach efforts and suggest several enhancements to our program that we feel will lead to its success."

9962584,Design an Assessment for an Introductory Computer Science Course: A Systematic Literature Review,"this research full paper presents a literature review on introductory cs assessments. as computer science (cs) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory cs courses to follow the trend. however, students have different levels of exposure to cs when they start cs in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. this disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. in the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. cs professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. therefore, cs departments need an assessment to measure students cs knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate cs introductory courses. though a vast number of research papers discuss cs introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). this paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory cs contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students understanding of introductory cs concepts, and some existing assessmentsconcept inventories. by reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. we collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. we found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. multiple-choice and code writing questions, which are more popular than code explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students knowledge. scratch is commonly used as a cs0 assessment language, while python, java, c, and pseudo-codes are employed in cs1 assessments. fcs1, scs1, and bdsi are existing assessmentsconcept inventories for cs1 or cs2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of cs0 (computational thinking), cs1 (fundamentals), and cs2 (data structure). designing a comprehensive cs0cs1cs2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use."
9794193,Exploring Diversity in Introductory Programming Classes: An Experience Report,"digitization is becoming part of almost everyones life, ranging from smartphones and tablets, smart devices automatically collecting information, to tools and scripting languages that are widely available and easy to use. this has recently been reflected in various university curricula, where courses such as computational thinking, and basic programming classes are now included in a broader range of (non-computer-science) programs. however, these programs often face challenges in such courses due to their diverse student body, with students often lacking profound digital competencies and technical background. while gender diversity aspects have been broadly studied in the past, other diversity dimensions such as ethnicity, age, or educational background have largely been neglected thus far. in this paper, we report on our experiences in teaching an introductory programming course to first-year business informatics bachelor students. after undergoing fundamental changes in our teaching concepts and the provided learning material, we explore what diversity factors play an important role when teaching programming to non-computer science students, and how diversity is perceived by lecturers and tutors. our analysis confirms that a collaborative teaching concept positively supports female students and students with language barriers."
7140058,A Distributed Robot Garden System,"computational thinking is an important part of a modern education, and robotics provides a powerful tool for teaching programming logic in an interactive and engaging way. the robot garden presented in this paper is a distributed multi-robot system capable of running autonomously or under user control from a simple graphical interface. over 100 origami flowers are actuated with leds and printed pouch motors, and are deployed in a modular array around additional swimming and crawling folded robots. the garden integrates state-of-the-art rapid design and fabrication technologies with distributed systems software techniques to create a scalable swarm in which robots can be controlled individually or as a group. the garden can be used to teach basic algorithmic concepts through its distributed algorithm demonstration capabilities and can teach programming concepts through its education-oriented user interface."
7017829,Algorithmic thinking observation: How students of applied informatics break the mystery of black box applications,"the black box is a system with the internal organization and behavior about which the observer has no information. however, it is possible to impact the whole system via its inputs and observe its reactions via its outputs. the paper is concerned with the implementation of black box type of activities to teach computational thinking. the main idea is to give the students the puzzles and ask them to play with the inputs and observe the outputs enough to determine the internal mechanisms or principles that produce particular outputs from given inputs. first year students were asked to define a formula or describe a principle, based on which the input transforms itself into the output. there were four different types of answers: the student could be able (1) to state a formal proof, (2) to state a verbal proof, (3) to state a basic concept of algorithms, or (4) not to state any type of correct solution. we found out that a lot of the students were not able to think about the concept of the application functioning and were not able to create any formal description of algorithms."
7943092,A computing education approach for geography students in context of GIS,"we present an educational design for an undergraduate university course meant to engage geography majors with computing and computational thinking. for that matter, we use the pedagogical principle of contextualization, relating computing topics to the discipline of geography using climate change modeling with geographic information systems as a context. following a design-based research approach, we first present considerations and arguments that form the basis for our educational design, and then discuss initial results of implementing and teaching a corresponding course to geography education majors."
9766768,Evaluating Usability and Educational Effectiveness of a Serious Game for Programmers Using Alternative Interfaces and Types of Activities,"this paper presents a serious game that has been developed for programmers aiming to analyze and examine the effectiveness and the perceived usability of two different game interfaces. this game presents a drag-and-drop interface and a classical typing interface and towards this approach, four different versions of the same game were developed. each version of the game focuses on either creating a part of code or debugging (finding the errors in the code provided). the game enables the players to advance their programming skills and computational thinking by engaging them in problem-solving activities during the gameplay. this paper provides insight and focuses on the evaluation of different interfaces in a serious game that is developed for programmers and targets fundamental programming concepts."
9969519,A Case Study on Learning Visual Programming With TutoApp for Composition of Tutorials: An Approach for Learning by Teaching,"teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. in particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. in this article, the tutoapp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on learning by teaching, where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. the hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. an experiment with a preposttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use tutoapp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used tutoapp). the findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with tutoapp significantly improved students academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. however, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. the results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students."
6974114,Minimal role playing logic in Role-Based Collaboration,"role-based collaboration (rbc) is a computational thinking methodology where roles provide an underlying mechanism to facilitate abstraction, classification, separation of concerns, dynamics, and interactions. from a meta theoretical perspective, the specification of groups, roles and agents is a critical element of rbc. in consideration of the relationships and hierarchies faced by groups, roles and agents, we propose a minimal role playing logic system (mrpl) through substructural logic, which is polynomial in complexity, in support of rbc. from mrpl and rpls extending from it, there are three levels of application, i.e., the global level governing how people organize agents to form a group; the concatenative level for role assignment with respect to logic and algebra, and the operational level governing properties, relations and structures that should appear in collaborative system design. from mrpl to rpls, one can extend it to suit other appropriate applications."
10342942,Motivating the New Generation: Using Flipped Classroom and ARCS Model to Enhance Block-Based Programming Education,"this research-to-practice full paper presents an explorative study investigating the effects of flipped learning on the learning motivation of primary school students enrolled in a block-based programming course. technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. however, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. to learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. this may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. to accommodate different learning styles and increase students motivation, this study employed the arcs motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students motivation and improve teachers teaching effectiveness. the study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. the studys findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the arcs model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction."
9453965,Build your own robot,"this research to practice full paper presents a pilot test framed in educational robotics where parents and child work together during the same session. in recent years, an educational movement has emerged that is related to the introduction of computational thinking, programming, and robotics in schools. educational robotics is presented as one more resource that serves as a support in the different curricular subjects and facilitates the emergence of skills such as socialization, creative spirit and personal initiative, allowing participants to find answers to the problems that may arise in their reality. it is for this reason that a pilot test was carried out where we included the participants parents in a session. to do this we used the crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. this platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. from the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people. at the end of the experience, the assistants completed the assembly of their own robot. the article contains a study of the state of the art of using educational robotics. it also includes an analysis of the different tools mostly used in educational robotics. also, throughout the article the learning methodology used, the different educational resources and the results obtained from the experience are described."
9018582,Robotics in the Resocialization of Youngsters and Teenagers in Socio-Educational Measures,"this paper presents a proposal and an experience report of an educational robotics course integrated to the process of resocialization of youngsters and teenagers in socio-educational measures. this proposal adopts a teaching approach oriented to the development of comprehension, analysis, logical reasoning, creativity and collaboration skills in order to develop in these young people real world problemsolving skills. the main challenge of this proposal is to favor the assimilation of the contents and the development of robotics practice outside the classroom, since, in accommodation, no course material is accessible from paper and pencil to robotics practice instruments. thus, the main differential of this work is literally working the computational thinking in spaces of deprivation of liberty in order to develop ideas for problem solving tasks. the results of this developed experience point to excellent opportunities for resocialization and professional orientation of young people in socio-educational measures through the teaching of robotics."
9973573,Integrating Computer Science and Physical Education in Elementary Schools with Data Science Learning Modules Using Wearable Microcontrollers,"with limited time in the school day to meet required state-level objectives across subjects, it is challenging to meet the need to address declining physical activity levels and to incorporate additional computer science instruction in elementary schools. project movesmart uses a web-based platform to integrate opportunities for physical education with computer science and computational thinking (csct) learning activities. fourth grade students who underwent a single-day intervention experienced a significant improvement in their interest in coding and their perceptions of coders. this paper presents a series of three new lessons in the fifth grade movesmart curriculum that allow students to create and improve a physical activity monitor. we employ a project-based learning approach to expose students to data analysis and machine learning in the framework of classification and pattern recognition."
9028486,Algorithmic Expressions for Assessing Algorithmic Thinking Ability of Elementary School Children,"this research to practice full paper presents the development of the algorithmic expressions for the assessment tools for assessing algorithmic thinking ability of elementary school children. in japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. the purpose of this programming education is to nurture computational thinking (ct) for elementary school children in japan. however, almost no discussion has been conducted in japan on how to measure the level of ct an elementary school child has acquired. since the definition of ct is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of ct. therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of ct. among the concepts of ct in those operational definitions, algorithmic thinking was chosen as a representative of ct, and the assessment tools for evaluating algorithmic thinking ability have been developed in this research. the assessment tool was conducted in the experimental computer science unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in japan. there were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. by answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15. the scores were statistically analyzed."
9962664,CS Pathways: A Culturally Responsive Computer Science Curriculum for Middle School,"in this research-to-practice full paper, we report on cs pathways, a middle school computer science (cs) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the northeast usa. the curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. the partnership focuses on bridging the gap between stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and community and gender gap within stem. the project is based on culturally responsive pedagogy (crp), which includes the importance of recognizing students culture in all facets of learning. the project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (rpp) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.the project curriculum was collaboratively developed by cs researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. using the rpp process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.the curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. the curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code 1. the curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of computer science for all. this paper advocates for the need for culturally-responsive computing, describes how it is integrated into teachers instruction, and presents the cs pathways curriculum design."

10578653,Exploring the Interplay of Computational Thinking and Mathematics in Early Childhood Education: A Systematic Review,"in recent years, educational research has emphasized the significance of computational thinking (ct) and mathematics knowledge acquisition for students learning in engineering subjects. pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. while the relationship between ct and mathematics has been extensively studied at the k-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ece) contexts. our research aims to investigate the potential development of early ct through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. to commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between ct and mathematics during early childhood. using the seven powerful ideas from early ct proposed by bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardwaresoftware, and representation are the most studied ct competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. the complex relationship between early ct and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of ct in young children. although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early ct within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field."
9690630,Research on the Educational Model of Computational Thinking Cultivation in Primary and Middle Schools Oriented to Production-Based Learning,"project-based learning and steam education are widely favored by schools and teachers because both of them are student-centered learning models by allowing students to collaborate and explore around issues in order to promote the development of students learning in the 21st century. however, in practical pedagogical applications, specific educational models and implementations are highly dependent on exceptional teachers with innovative abilities, especially in the cultivation of implicit higher-order thinking of students still lacking a better landing point. in the context of the current era of rapid development of information technology, the educational changes caused by the new development of smart education mean that more attention should be paid to the level of thinking and operational skills of students. as a result, the problem-based learning for computational thinking development model for primary and secondary schools (ctpbl), which is interdisciplinary, contextual, innovative, experiential and humanistic in nature, has emerged. as a new educational model, ctpbl helps integrate the advantages of existing project-based learning and steam education, crack the dilemma of teachers choice of the inherent educational model, and realize the cultivation of students information literacy and the improvement of their comprehensive ability. however, it still needs to be further explored, such as its operation mechanism, technology carrier, and teachers roles."

10423685,Neuroeducation: Guidelines for Computational Thinking training,"computational thinking (ct) skills are a key competency for all citizens, but for computer programming students these abilities are crucial. several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the ct skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. for that purpose, teachers responsible for the childrens education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training ct skills. there are already many learning resources (lr) for this training, however, we believe that neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these lr in the teaching and learning process. currently, educational neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. this important knowledge about the brains learning process can be turned into principles applicable in education. this paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative ct training. neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. the guidelines inspired by neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in lr, in order to promote more effective training. one concrete lr for primary school, created by our masters students in computing education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal."
9620553,A Typology of Models for Integrating Computational Thinking in Science (CT+S),"in order to expand opportunities to learn computer science (cs), there is a growing push for inclusion of cs concepts and practices, such as computational thinking (ct), in required subjects like science. integrated, transdisciplinary (csctx) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to cs and ct learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective cs coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of cs work. emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in cs. yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for cs and ct integration contribute to desired outcomes. there has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine ct integration in science (ct s). the purpose of delineating a typology of cts integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of ct and science. for each model in the typology, we characterize how cts integration is accomplished, the ways in which ct learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms."
9744486,The Effect on Computational Thinking Using SRA-Programming: Anticipating Changes in a Dynamic Problem Environment,"this article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (sra) among primary school pupils when programming robots. research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (ct). the literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply sra-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. in order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of sra-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (staticdynamic). in these conditions, pupils use lego ev-3 robots and mindstorms software to solve programming problems. as a post-measurement, a lego challenge is applied. in this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of ct skills. furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. it is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes sra-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. the influence of sra-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of ct."

9900775,Efficacy of a ‘Misconceiving’ Robot to Improve Computational Thinking in a Collaborative Problem Solving Activity: A Pilot Study,"robot-mediated learning activities are often designed as collaborative exercises where children work together to achieve the activity objectives. although miscommunications and misunderstandings occur frequently, humans, unlike robots, are very good at overcoming them and converging to a shared solution. with the aim of equipping a robot with these abilities and exploring its effects, in this article we investigate how a humanoid robot can collaborate with a human learner to construct a shared solution to a problem via suggesting actions and (dis)agreeing with each other. concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. the results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms."
10604485,A Systematic Approach to Catalogue Learning Resources that Promote Computational Thinking,"computational thinking (ct) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for computer programming. we believe that ct skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. however, to promote the development of ct it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call learning resources (lr). for a more efficient development of ct, it is important that the lr are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. scientific evidence from neuroeducation can be used to fully explore lr. there are many lr available to promote ct, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific ct skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. this paper aims to present an approach to categorize these lr so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific ct skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate lr more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. this characterization approach is based on ontocne ontology. ontocne was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop ct (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). this paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the lr characterization. to illustrate our approach, we will follow ontocne statements to categorize a set of lrs. with this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of lr more effectively promote ct skills on children."

10893178,WIP: Professional Learning in Computational Thinking for Early Childhood Teachers in Latin America,"this research to practice work in progress paper explores changes in teachers knowledge of integrating computational thinking (ct) into early childhood education in a professional learning (pl) initiative. the main goal of the program is to prepare teachers to develop ct practices into early childhood learning environments by fostering several key components: recognizing the significance of ct development from early childhood, applying pedagogical practices (i.e. unplugged activities, use-modify-create), identifying socially constructed roles and stereotypes surrounding toys, implications of screen and device usage in learning, and developing skills to design ct learning activities tailored for their own classroom settings. to achieve our goals, the research team designed, implemented, and evaluated an online 30-hour pl program with educators from latin american countries. approximately 80 teachers completed the online pl program. the participating teachers engaged with the pl program weekly by providing written journal reflections. in the final week, they were asked to design a lesson based on what they learned and implement it into their classroom. teachers completed a pre- and post-survey surrounding their self-efficacy and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (tpack) in ct. data sources include pre- and post-surveys, teacher journal reflections, and lesson plans developed by teachers. in this paper, we analyzed their journal reflections to qualitatively develop an understanding of how teachers progressed in the pl. the lesson plans will be analyzed to identify: (1) the learning goals for the students, (2) which activities teachers preferred to implement, and (3) how they assessed student learning in ct in their classroom. preliminary findings demonstrate the types of ct activities they implemented in their classrooms. teachers also created lessons that met their students needs which further provides examples of how ct is integrated within the existing curriculum surrounding student interest and culture. many pl programs often teach about ct concepts, but do not offer a chance to implement a lesson plan and reflect on their experience. this process helps teachers develop self-efficacy for teaching ct in an elementary classroom and teachers reported that they would continue to integrate ct within their future instruction. also, this program contributes to the reduction of the gender gap in ct, promoting equitable practices in early childhood education."
9962505,When Does Collaborative Interaction Support Learning of Computational Thinking Among Undergraduate Students,"collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. however, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. this qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (ct) class. in analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the differentiating overt learning activities (dola) framework developed by chi was used as a starting point. several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connectplan) suggested by chis overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. however, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the dola framework also emerged. these are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding."

NA2024100650,Validating a performance assessment of computational thinking for early childhood using item response theory,"despite growing interest in early childhood computational thinking (ct), there is a lack of validated assessments for children who are emerging readers. this paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of ct using item response theory (irt) from 272 children aged 48. using a two-parameter logistic model irt model (2pl irt), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. item analyses revealed a high discriminability (m 2.26, sd 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (m 0.21; sd 0.86), on average, across 19 items. reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx 0.87). differential item functioning (dif) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated childrens item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. however, we confirmed gaps in latent ability () of ct by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of ct than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess ct for children who are emerging readers."
XU2022101041,Relations of computational thinking to reasoning ability and creative thinking in young children: Mediating role of arithmetic fluency,"computational thinking (ct) is an important and essential skill for human beings to master in the 21st century. although ct has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between ct and other cognitive abilities for young children. to provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that ct was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of ct to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. this study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 56 years. consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that ct and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between ct and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics orand abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between ct and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining ct skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. therefore, despite the root in computer science, ct is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including ct into early school education."

KONG2024105126,Dynamic interplays between self-regulated learning and computational thinking in primary school students through animations and worksheets,"recent studies identify self-regulated learning (srl) as a key factor in enhancing cognitive development, particularly within computational thinking (ct) literature. however, research gaps remain in understanding how srl and ct interact from a developmental perspective. our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students learning and cognitive development. using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 hong kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising srl and ct in a large-scale ct program. additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher srl skills enhance cognitive ct abilities, and vice versa. complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the ct program significantly boosted students srl and cognitive development. these findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. schools should consider implementing srl strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students cognitive development. furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with edtech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. these insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive srl environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education."
HOLSTEIN2025101772,Scratch teachers' perceptions of teaching computational thinking with school subjects in a constructionist approach,"in recent years, there has been increasing interest in integrating computational thinking (ct) into elementary schools. however, few studies have focused on teachers perceptions. this study aims to examine teachers perceptions to bridge the gap between theory and practice. the study analysed teachers perceptions of integrating ct into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using scratch a leading programming platform inspired by resnicks lifelong kindergarten constructionist model. over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. the teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. the findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. however, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students learning engagement and personal development. by addressing the identified challenges, teacher education designers, curriculum developers, and schools can develop practices for closing the gap between theory and practice."
SUHERMAN2024101591,Role of creative self-efficacy and perceived creativity as predictors of mathematical creative thinking: Mediating role of computational thinking,"in the field of education, research has consistently emphasized mathematical creative thinking as a crucial component of 21st-century skills. thus, this cross-sectional study examines the predictors of such thinking by specifically focusing on the roles of perceived creativity, creative self-efficacy, and computational thinking. the participants consisted of 896 secondary school students (52.9 female; 47.1 male) in indonesia who were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires and tests. for analysis, structural equation modeling was employed, demonstrating satisfactory construct validity and instrument reliability. based on the results, there was a positive association between computational thinking and mathematical creative thinking. in addition, perceived creativity had a positive impact on mathematical creative thinking, whereas creative self-efficacy showed a negative association. as for the empirical model, it revealed that computational thinking plays a mediating role, connecting perceived creativity and creative self-efficacy to mathematical creative thinking. the findings suggest that incorporating these skills and related variables into the mathematics curriculums in schools is essential for preparing students for success in the 21st century."
WANG2025101729,Cognitive foundations in the interplay between computational thinking and creativity: A scoping review,"previous studies have explored the relationship between computational thinking (ct) and creativity. however, a consensus has yet to be reached since both ct and creativity varied in ideation and assessment. to uncover the cognitive mechanism underlying the interplay between ct and creativity, we conduct a scoping review of 26 empirical studies published in 20062024. our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between ct and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on ct skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in ct neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks. although executive functions (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) play a crucial role in both ct and creativity, their contributions to the ct-creativity interplay are still rarely studied. future research should explore the ct-creativity relationship from the perspective of neuroscience."
LEE2022102008,Computer science education and K-12 students’ computational thinking: A systematic review,"this systematic review examined how computer science (cs) education was implemented in schools and its efficacy for developing students computational thinking (ct). sixty-six papers were selected for this systematic review and analyzed for patterns in relation to the implementation of cs education in k-12 schools and its impact on the development of students ct skills. although educational interventions have not always been successful in cs education, this review provides strong evidence that overall, cs education promotes the development of students ct in the k-12 setting while improving their creative and critical thinking skills. we recommend early access to cs education, various innovative instructional approaches to cs education and appropriate support and guidance for student learning."
SUN2024101542,Comparative experiment of the effects of unplugged and plugged-in programming on computational thinking in primary school students: A perspective of multiple influential factors,"recently, the development of computational thinking (ct) skills has become widespread in the whole world. there is a consensus to develop students ct skills through unplugged and plugged-in programming. however, the choice of programming approaches taught in schools is arbitrary and few studies have compared the effectiveness differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming. this study aimed to explore the differences between unplugged and plugged-in programming in developing ct skills of students in grades 1-2 students. it also explored the joint effects of students gender, programming experience, programming interest, and programming confidence with different programming approaches on ct skills. the quasi-experimental research approach was used to conduct 10 weeks of unplugged, plugged-in, and regular programming activities with 124 grades 1-2 students. the results found that unplugged programming promoted ct skills more in the early primary grades than plugged-in programming. we found that boys and students with programming experience in unplugged group performed significantly better in ct skills than in plugged-in group. moreover, the improvement of ct skills of students in unplugged group was positively correlated with the level of their programming interest and programming confidence. however, these were not observed in plugged-in group. the results of this study can provide precise guidance for teaching ct skills to early primary school students and provide references for ct education."
SCHLAUCH2025100704,More than words: Conceptualizing narrative computational thinking based on a multicase study,"this paper presents an investigation that compares and analyzes the interactions of three groups of pre-and-primary school children with three different storytelling systems. we identify emerging patterns through which they engaged in what we refer to as narrative computational thinking. the latter describes broadened aspects of narrative literacy practices that are linked to computational thinking. by applying a multicase study approach and through various vignettes, we illustrate how children applied computational thinking to understand and influence the narrative possibilities offered by the different tools. our results illustrate circumstances under which digital storytelling activities provide a favorable basis for narrative computational thinking, and that when computational thinking functions as a scaffold for story creation, it encourages a blend of creativity and computational thinking, providing a compelling approach to introducing emerging digital literacies to young children in a narrative context."

ZHANG2024105039,A metaphor-based robot programming approach to facilitating young children’s computational thinking and positive learning behaviors,"in the artificial intelligence age, cultivating young childrens computational thinking (ct) has sparked tremendous attention. programmable robotics is a developmental-appropriate and screen-free means that provides young children with great opportunities to learn programming and develop ct. however, it is reported that young children might have difficulties learning abstract ct concepts. as a helpful pedagogical facilitator, metaphors can help turn abstract concepts into more concrete and clear concepts that learners are familiar with. therefore, this research proposed a metaphor-based robot programming (mrp) approach and explored its impact on young childrens ct and behavioral patterns. a total of 118 children aged 56 were recruited in this experiment with two conditions: the experimental group adopted the metaphor-based robot programming (mrp) approach while the control group used the conventional robot programming (crp) approach. results revealed that children who adopted the mrp approach outperformed children who adopted the crp approach on ct. in addition, behavioral analysis indicated that the proposed mrp approach could facilitate childrens superior learning performance and more positive learning behaviors, so as to help them achieve learning objectives. accordingly, this study can provide insightful guidance and inspiration for future research on effective programming teaching and ct development for young children."
WANG2023101269,The role of computer supported project-based learning in students’ computational thinking and engagement in robotics courses,"computational thinking (ct) is a necessary skill for students. it is as important as the other essential skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. however, how to improve students ct in robotics is still to be explored. hence, this study examined the effects of computer supported project-based learning (cspbl) on students ct and learning engagement through comparing students ct and engagement in two courses instructed by the same instructor (one instructed with a traditional method, the other instructed with cspbl). participants were seventy-nine students from a university in china. questionnaires, interviews, and project analysis were used to measure students ct and learning engagement. the comparative results of self-reports and final projects indicated that the cspbl enhanced students ct. the simulation project training based on the sensestudy learning platform in cspbl helped students debug the programming code, optimize the algorithm design, and improve their algorithmic thinking, cooperation, and problem solving during the program error correction. the cspbl also improved students engagement in learning, especially for those with more than one year of programming experience. it was found that the cspbl was effective in terms of improving students ct and engagement in robotics learning. this study provides teachers with practical suggestions to conduct effective robotics instruction."
UNG2022104379,Computational thinking for teachers: Development of a localised E-learning system,"malaysia has introduced computational thinking skills as part of a curriculum integration update to meet the global trends in 21st-century education, focusing on empowering digital literacy. nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. the study explores the feasibility of developing a localized e-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. an e-learning system, termed as myctgwbl, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teachinglearning repertoire to the teachers. the hypothesis is that myctgwbl would develop teachers computational thinking and its position in teachinglearning understanding. myctgwbl relevance was tested through delone and mcleans information system and urbachs collaboration quality construct. to determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. a total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. participants understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. the closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using spss statistics 22.0. a significant improvement in teachers computational thinking teachinglearning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. the e-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and computational thinking (ct) knowledge benefits. results demonstrate that myctgwbl could be used to guide future planning when establishing ct knowledge acquisition initiatives, particularly among teachers."
WU2024105012,Enhancing English writing and higher-order thinking skills through computational thinking,"efforts to incorporate computational thinking (ct) into academic courses have been gaining popularity. ct is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. ct may be used to support language education. courses in english as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. to address the problems, ct, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. the experimental group was instructed using the ct teaching model based on cts essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. in total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. a combination of writing, ct skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. the collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the maxqda 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. the results of this study indicate that incorporating ct into an english writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students. the ct concepts helps students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating the text and identifying potential issues or improvements. additionally, it allows students to use their skills to create unique writing solutions, which can boost english writing creativity."
SUN2025101852,Comparative study of codecombat-based python programming and scratch programming effects on sixth graders' Computational thinking: interaction effects of gender and programming experience,"text-based python and block-based scratch programming have received significant attention in primary school computational thinking (ct) education. however, few studies have compared the differences between codecombat-based python and scratch programming approaches and knowledge of their relative effectiveness is lacking. this study aimed to explore differences in the impact of codecombat-based python and scratch programming on sixth grade students ct. the influence of students gender and programming experience was also considered. therefore, we conducted an 11-week quasi-experimental study with 87 students. they were divided into two groups to participate in codecombat-based python and scratch programming teaching activities respectively. the results showed that both codecombat-based python and scratch programming activities significantly improved students ct skills, but python programming had more effective and sustained effects on students ct development. we also found that scratch programming eliminated differences in ct from programming experience. in contrast, codecombat-based python programming amplified the influence of programming experience and benefitted the ct development of students with programming experience. more interestingly, there was no gender difference in students ct in the python group, but there were significant interaction effects between gender and programming experience. we found that girls with programming experience improved significantly more in ct than boys with programming experience, breaking gender stereotypes in ct. this study enriches researchers and frontline teachers understanding of codecombat-based python and scratch programming and provides empirical evidence for future teaching approach choices."
SU2023100122,A systematic review of integrating computational thinking in early childhood education,"computational thinking education has become an increasingly popular topic among practitioners and researchers. however, rare is known how to effectively teach and learn computational thinking in early childhood education. to address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. the content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance childrens computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination. this systematic review informs future endeavors in theorizing a digital learning framework that can integrate computational thinking into early childhood education."
KONG2025105281,A latent profile analysis of teachers’ knowledge about and perceived usefulness of computational thinking and how teacher profiles relate to student achievement,"teacher competencies encompass the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, yet few studies have analysed teachers latent profiles in relation to the interaction between these two dimensions. latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (ct) as a method for identifying student profiles. however, the latent profiles of ct teachers have not yet been analysed. we therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in ct, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of ct. three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. qualitative data further triangulated these findings. we also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in ct. they also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using ct for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. as few studies have explored teachers latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of ct."
ROBLEDOCASTRO2023102329,Effect of COGNI-MACHINE computational thinking training on executive functions in children aged 9 to 11: Protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial,"we designed a controlled trial protocol that seeks to contribute to cognitive science by studying the effect of thought training on childrens executive functions. the study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation, with two parallel groups: an experimental group and a tau control group. with three measures, pre-test, post-test, and follow-up after three months. the participants will be children aged 9 to 11. the allocation will be randomized by groups and not individually. the sample will be a minimum of 44 participants. the primary measures will be neuropsychological tests to assess executive functions. secondary measures will be a computational thinking test, neuropsychological tests to assess metacognition and attention, and an acceptability scale. the experimental group will participate in the cogni-machine computational thinking training designed by the first author. the training frequency will be twice a week in 60 min sessions for 12 weeks. the tau control group will receive computer science classes as usual during the same time as the experimental group. the evaluators taking the measurements will be blinded to the assignment. the investigators in charge of the intervention will be blinded to the results of the evaluations."
YOUJUN2024101624,Relieving negative Chinese transfer in EFL syntactic writing through negative feedback based on computational thinking,"negative feedback can temporarily relieve negative chinese transfer (nct) in english as a foreign language (efl) syntactic writing by focusing only on the surface writing constructs, neglecting that efl writing is an embodiment of the process by which higher-order thinking operates. to solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (igda) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (ct), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the nct in efl syntactic writing. we analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the nct obtained through repeated-measure anova and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. the results indicated that igda in the form of negative feedback based on ct principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the nct, (2) improve learners efl writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. this innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the efl writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education."
BROZA2023101285,“Start from scratch”: Integrating computational thinking skills in teacher education program,"in the digital age, our lives become more dependent on technology, yet the digital gap is intensifying especially because most people lack digital literacy. as a modest step to handle this challenge, we designed a course named play with me in code to develop pre-service teachers (psts) thinking skills and expose them to learning by creation using computational thinking and programming as part of the constructionism paradigm. the added value of using scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. the present study aims to examine 25 psts attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with scratch. to this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged psts use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game. studys conclusions relate to the importance of providing psts opportunities to experience learning by programming for raising their awareness of the importance of enhancing thinking skills and creativity in the future."
CHEN2023101224,Visualising trends in computational thinking research from 2012 to 2021: A bibliometric analysis,"using the analytical tool citespace, this review study conducted a bibliometric analysis of the characteristics of 249 studies on computational thinking (ct) indexed in the web of science from 2012 to 2021. the multi-dimensional analytical approach provided a holistic view of the scope of ct research and its progression,and enabled the major topics, themes, disciplinary domains, and prominent authors, institutes, countriesregions, and papers to be identified. based on the general descriptive data analysis, the results showed that ct has gained increasing influence as a field of research over the past decade. a clustering analysis of the retrieved keywords showed that the development of ct in k-12 education was the most frequently discussed topic. the co-occurrence knowledge maps identified the 11 main research themes and their progress. the research was from a wide spectrum of disciplines including education, science education, computer science, interdisciplinary application, psychology, engineering, and information systems. the highest co-citations were found in the journals of communication of the acm, computers and education, and computers in human behaviors. the researchers, institutes, and countriesregions that have made the most significant contributions to ct research and the 10 most highly cited ct studies were also identified. overall, the findings of this review study indicate the paths for future research on developing ct in the classroom."
CHENG2023104794,Enhancing student's computational thinking skills with student-generated questions strategy in a game-based learning platform,"computational thinking (ct), a way to think about solving problems, is recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. although game-based learning (gbl) has been shown to improve students ct skills, students may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to develop higher-order thinking. also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the ct core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students problem-solving thinking. as the adoption of student-generated questions (sgq) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a gbl platform that uses this strategy to enhance students ct skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. for this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental ct activities. this study shows that the experimental group using the sgq strategy with a gbl platform exhibited significantly higher ct skills than the control group. in addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. this confirms that integrating the sgq strategy and ct core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities."
PEREZ2023312,"CT for equity: situating computational thinking, computer science, and social justice in a math and science teacher education program","teacher preparation programs currently struggle to (a) address the challenges preparing students to use computing principles, and (b) do so in ways that apply a critical lens toward societal inequities. in this paper, we describe our (1) integrated stem and computational thinking (ct) teacher preparation program; (2) response to barriers educators face in preparing students to critically use computing principles; and (3) examples of the pedagogical practices teacher candidates developed through the program. we contribute an approach to preparing and empowering educators to support students understanding and use of ct as a lens for advocating for social justice in their lives."
KONG2021106836,Item response analysis of computational thinking practices: Test characteristics and students’ learning abilities in visual programming contexts,"computational thinking (ct) practices have gained increasing importance in primary school education. however, there are few tools to measure primary school students ct practices that are based on rigorous psychometric approaches. this study developed an operational definition for ct practices by exploring the key dimensions of their composition and, more importantly, developed and validated a generic test tool that can effectively assess students ct practices. items to measure ct practices were developed using the evidence-centered design (ecd) approach. these items prompted students to exhibit behaviors that demonstrated their skills in the four dimensions of ct practice, namely testing and debugging, algorithmic thinking, reusing and remixing, and abstracting and modularizing. a test consisting of these items was administered to 13,956 grade 46 primary school students from 56 public schools in hong kong. the data were analyzed based on the item response theory (irt) approach, together with other psychometric tests. a bi-factor three-parameter logistic model was ultimately adopted for test validation, as it fitted the data better than the corresponding two-parameter and one-parameter logistic models. the results validated the four-dimensional structure of the ct practices test. the reliability, test item characteristics, and ct practice abilities of students are also discussed."
CELIK2023102026,"Exploring the Determinants of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Literacy: Digital Divide, Computational Thinking, Cognitive Absorption","to effectively utilize artificial intelligence (ai)-based technologies such as chatgpt and realize their novel ethical issues, individuals must have a variety of knowledge and skills about ai. such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of ai literacy. despite the importance of ai literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. to better understand the determinants of ai literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. the model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. as a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of ai literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating ai-based technologies. moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (icts) are more expected to use and recognize ai. also, motivation and skills in using icts enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of ai-based technologies. the findings also showed that convenient access to icts contributes to a deep involvement with ai-based technologies in the use. further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use ai technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies."
ISRAELFISHELSON2022104353,Studying interrelations of computational thinking and creativity: A scoping review (2011–2020),"both computational thinking (ct) and creativity have been recognized as key skills for todays learners. over the last decade, research of both skills in a single context has emerged. in this paper, we present a scoping review of 62 such empirical from 2011 to 2020. our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both ct and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the us and prominence of developed european countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on stem-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of ct spread. we also found that when studying ct and creativity jointly, it is most common to define ct in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, ct is barely referred to as such. taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of ct and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders. doing so may build a bridge between ct and creativity in a way that will benefit both."
ODGAARD2023100598,Who programs whom?—Computational empowerment through mastery and appropriation in young children’s computational thinking activities,"this paper sheds light on 35-year-old childrens enactments of computational empowerment (ce) in activities with computational thinking (ct). ct is widely elaborated on as a universal problem-solving approach and a skill set necessary for thriving in todays digitized societies. scholars claim that ct for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young childrens learning of ct. based on 1.5 years of co-designing for childrens situated ct in two danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. the findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend childrens mastery of ct in any narrow sense. this is examined as situated enactments of ce; as childrens critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives. the paper concludes that childrens various enactments of ce deserve scholarly and professional attention, both as an important prerequisite for, and as a necessary limitation to, the implementation of ct in kindergartens."
JOHNLEMAY2021100056,Instructional interventions for computational thinking: Examining the link between computational thinking and academic performance,"teaching computational thinking (ct) has become a priority for educators and policymakers tasked with educating and training students for future jobs which are predicted to be increasingly automated. recent research on effective instructional interventions for developing computational thinking skills, including algorithmic and critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and cooperativity, suggests that teaching and learning ct can improve student academic performance. in fact, the extant literature is quite sanguine about the topic of ct. however, few studies have attempted to establish a relationship between ct skills and academic performance. in the present cross-sectional study, we employ path analysis to model the structural relationship between self-reported ct skills and academic performance of a sample of 81 computer science undergraduates enrolled at a southwestern american university. we found few direct relationships between ct skills and academic performance. we only find a significant positive relationship between creativity and academic performance and a significant negative relationship between cooperativity and academic performance. our findings are surprising considering the abundant research promoting computational thinking as a key component of 21st century skills. the findings call for further in-depth analysis of computational thinking and the influence on students learning and learning outcomes. we discuss our results with respect to recent educational mandates for including ct and instructional alignment in school curricula. our findings contribute to the existing discussion by helping to clarify the relationship between ct skills and academic performance in higher education."
HU202381,Scaffolding young children's computational thinking with teacher talk in a technology-mediated classroom,"although studies have shown that computational thinking (ct) can enhance learning processes and outcomes across traditional subjects, they have not shown how teachers might scaffold childrens ct processes in a technology-mediated learning context. this exploratory study examined how teacher talk and technologies impacted the ct of three children (6 to 8 years old). seven videotaped 90-minute sessions of weekly project-based activities yielded 4,842 turns of talk (2,974 by children). statistical discourse analysis revealed the following results. after a teacher command, the children more often executed a sequence of actions toward a solution but less often demonstrated problem understanding than otherwise. following a teachers open question, the children were more likely to offer logically organized ideas. in response to a teachers rhetorical question, they more often searched for information. these results inform educators regarding when to use each type of teacher talk to scaffold childrens ct processes."
YILMAZ2023100147,"The effect of generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool use on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy and motivation","chatgpt (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (ai) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. however, the effect of using chatgpt in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. this study investigated the effect of programming education using the chatgpt on students computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. the research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. the research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. students were randomly divided into experimental (n 21) and control (n 24) groups. while the experimental group students benefited from the chatgpt during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. research findings revealed that the experimental group students computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. in line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from ai technologies such as chatgpt in programming trainings. the research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of ai support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard."
HOOSHYAR2024122283,ImageLM: Interpretable image-based learner modelling for classifying learners’ computational thinking,"predictive learner modelling is crucial for personalized education. while convolutional neural networks (cnns) have shown great success in education, their potential in learner modelling via image data is unexplored. this research introduces a novel and interpretable approach for image-based learner modelling (imagelm) using cnns and transfer learning to model learners performance and accordingly classify their computational thinking solutions. the approach integrates grad-cam, enabling it to provide insights into its decision-making process. findings show that our custom cnn outperforms other models (namely resnet, vgg, and inception), with 83 accuracy in predicting solution correctness. more importantly, the imagelm approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy ai for education. these results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle."
KOPCHA2023100156,Children's computational thinking as the development of a possibility space,"in this paper, we explore how the theoretical notion of possibility space offers a way to study how childrens computational thinking develops as a process. drawing on embodied notions of cognition, we first examine the literature that supports how childrens computational thinking emerges as a possibility space that involves conceptualizing possible actions in a given moment, deciding which action to take by anticipating the results of a possible action, and learning from the actions that they have taken. we then use a grounded approach to analyze the problem-solving process of two 5th-grade children who engaged in an educational robotics activity over two 50-minute class periods. the findings lend support for approaching childrens computational thinking as a cycle of action-taking that includes conceptualizing, anticipating, and taking action. the findings also support the pedagogical practice of having children predict the results of a computer program to enhance their computational thinking. implications for the way that teachers can support children in learning to conceptualize what is possible and take action from it are discussed."
SUN2022101043,The bidirectional predictions between primary school students’ STEM and language academic achievements and computational thinking: The moderating role of gender,"in the era of artificial intelligence, computational thinking (ct) has become a key skill that digital citizens should possess in the 21st century. there has already been a popular research trend to integrate ct into school curriculum, especially in the stem field. however, there are still limited large scale research studies on the bidirectional relationships between primary schoolers stem academic achievement and ct skills, and so is language academic achievement, especially with the longitudinal research methods. this study adopted correlation analysis and cross-lagged regression analysis in a longitudinal study to separately explore the bidirectional predictive effect of stem academic achievement, language academic achievement, and ct skills of 1,487 chinese primary school students in grades 46 (1112 years old), and explored the moderating role of gender. the results showed that there were significant bidirectional predictions between students stem and language academic achievements and ct skills, which further confirmed the feasibility and advantages of integrating ct in stem and language subjects. in addition, gender only played a moderating role in the predictions of students ct skills on their language academic achievement. implications for reducing the gender differences in stem and ct fields are also discussed. the research results will provide references to integrating ct into the curriculum of basic education and improving the development of primary school students ct skills and promoting stem teaching practice."
HU2024101653,Unplugged activities in the elementary school mathematics classroom: The effects on students’ computational thinking and mathematical creativity,"the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (ct) education. however, research on unplugged activities influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programmings cognitive benefits. this study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi-experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. the research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. the overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students mathematical creativity and ct. students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (n 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (n 46). the results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students ct and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem-posing creativity (t 5.830, p 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t 6.633, p 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t 7.554, p 0.01). furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students mathematical creativity as a predictor of ct. the results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teachers and students interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method reported boredom and lack of interactivity. this research offered valuable insights for mathematics and ct education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the k-12 curriculum."
YANG2023101218,The impact of story-inspired programming on preschool children's computational thinking: A multi-group experiment,"computational thinking (ct) has received worldwide attention due to its alignment with developing 21st century skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence. with the increasing provision of programming tools such as robotic toys and tablet apps in the sector of early childhood education (ece), many ece researchers and practitioners tend to link ct to programming. however, children are reluctant to sustain their interests in programming activities, and may be further demotivated by debugging failures. this multi-group quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a story-inspired approach in bridging the gap between programming and ct for preschool children. building on previous literature suggesting storytelling as a powerful, culturally responsive pedagogy, 5-year-old children (n108) were involved in nine weeks of ct learning via one of the three conditions: story-inspired robot programming (sirp), story-inspired tablet programming (sitp), and unplugged ct education. results revealed that children who participated in the sirp and sitp conditions showed improved ct scores, relative to unplugged ct education, even after controlling for baseline ct scores. no gender or family socioeconomic effects were found to influence the benefits of story-inspired programming interventions. these findings suggest that storytelling as a culturally responsive approach, whether using robots or tablets as a programming tool, can provide young children with more inclusive and sustainable ct learning experiences."
BARKELA2024100463,Do student teachers experience self-worth threats in computational thinking?,"theory the successful implementation of computational thinking into primary schools requires that primary school teachers feel safe and confident in teaching this topic to young learners. however, many student teachers face low expectancy of success and heightened anxiety towards computational thinking. self-worth theory suggests that this may lead to a self-worth threat and in consequence to engagement in self-protective behaviours, hampering the successful acquisition of skills needed to implement computational thinking into their future classrooms. aims this study aims to investigate potential self-worth threats as amplifiers of student teachers resistance to engage in computational thinking. method 323 student teachers participated in the study. participants filled out a questionnaire on expectancy of success and anxiety towards computational thinking, and rated how likely they were to engage in self-protective behaviours, i.e., self-handicapping, avoiding novelty, and academic cheating, when learning about computational thinking at the start of the semester. results students showed heightened levels of anxiety and low levels of expectancy towards computational thinking. further, they reported that they would be likely to engage in self-protective behaviours. a structural equation model showed that anxiety towards computational thinking was positively related to self-protective behaviours. moreover, expectancy had a negative indirect effect via anxiety towards computational thinking on self-protective behaviours. discussion student teachers might experience self-worth threats when learning about computational thinking and engage in self-protective behaviours that might hamper their success. our findings caution the impact of possible self-worth threats on teaching methods, thus influencing childrens learning in the 21st century."
TUCKERRAYMOND2021104284,Science teachers can teach computational thinking through distributed expertise,"content area k-12 teachers are increasingly asked to integrate computing and computational thinking into their classrooms, yet they often have little experience with computing. the purpose of this study was to understand how science teachers, new to computing and integrating computational thinking into their classrooms, supported students as computational problem solvers. in the project from which this research was drawn, 8th grade science teachers in three us school districts integrated computer game design into their study of climate systems and climate change. we conducted participant observation, collected teacher implementation logs and interviewed 15 teachers engaged in the three-year design research project, building systems from scratch. analysis through grounded theory yielded several results related to teachers orientations, strategies, and use of resources to create systems of distributed expertise. we identified five major themes: a) releasing responsibility to students, b) co-learning with students, c) encouraging students independent problem solving, d) building interdependence among students, and e) providing multiple other resources. findings are discussed in relation to the literature on integrating computational thinking into content area classrooms."
GEROSA2021100043,Cognitive abilities and computational thinking at age 5: Evidence for associations to sequencing and symbolic number comparison,"computational thinking (ct) is currently used as an umbrella term in education to describe the processes associated with learning and applying computer science concepts and strategies for problem-solving. despite a growing body of literature on the subject within education and the development of a grand variety of tools designed to enhance computational thinking abilities, the relations between ct and other cognitive abilities have not been reported in young children. understanding ct from a cognitive development perspective could be useful for creating targeted interventions tailored for young children. in the present study, we compare a previously reported computational thinking assessment with a battery of nine cognitive tests, which include fluid intelligence, working memory, planning, sequencing, mental rotation, vocabulary, and early math precursors such as numerical transcoding and symbolic magnitude comparison. mixed-effects linear regressions were implemented with ct as a dependent variable to explore the associations between our variables. a subsample of children who participated in an educational robotics intervention were assessed in their robot programming performance, and its outcomes were compared with their ct assessments. results suggest temporal sequencing ability and symbolic magnitude comparison are significant predictors of ct in kindergarten. positive significant associations between robot programming and ct performance are reported."
ROBLEDOCASTRO2025103145,"Exploring computational thinking, executive functions, visuospatial skills and experiences with toys in early childhood: Protocol for a controlled trial","the research aims to evaluate the effect of a robotics-based computational thinking program on executive functions and visuospatial skills in preschool children. additionally, the study will explore the relationship between these three variables and early experiences with toys. the study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention measures. participants will be preschool children aged 5 to 6 years from both public and private institutions. the intervention will involve a new educational robotics device called roversa and will consist of eight sessions distributed over four weeks, with the experimental group placed on a waitlist. to assess executive functions and visuospatial skills, standardized and validated neuropsychological measures will be used, including the flanker task, the nih toolbox card sorting test, the corsi block test, the nepsy-ii mental rotation test, the pyramid of mexico from the eni-2 battery, and the computational thinking test (ctt). data analysis will begin with a hypothesis tested through anova-mr, and linear regressions will be implemented to assess the relationship between variables. it is expected that the results will contribute to the discussion on teaching computational thinking and educational robotics as early learning experiences and their impact on the cognitive development of children."

COBAN2021100929,An alternative approach for measuring computational thinking: Performance-based platform,"educators emphasize that computational thinking is especially helpful in raising problem-solving skills, improving logical reasoning, and developing analytical thinking. in this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. in the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. in the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. it has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. it is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, productportfolio or attitudeperception. therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results. considering the developments in computational thinking, it is thought that the study will contribute to the literature."
YANG2023324,Beyond computing: Computational thinking is associated with sequencing ability and self-regulation among Chinese young children,"computing education has progressively entered into childrens early years. due to a proliferation of computing education programs and coding tools designed for young children, research on the relationships between computational thinking (ct) and other domains of learning and development is highly warranted. yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between ct and childrens overall cognitive functioning. as such, this study explored the relationships between chinese childrens ct and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. one hundred and one chinese young children (ngirl 52 and nboy 49; mage 5.25, sd 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) ct positively predicted sequencing ability ( 0.27, p .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) ct positively predicted self-regulation ( 0.47, p .001) after controlling for demographic covariates. our findings suggest that ct may be a domain-general ability that is based on cognitive foundations that extend beyond the realm of computing."
DONG2025104824,Effects of digital badges on pupils' computational thinking and learning motivation in computer science,"computational thinking (ct) is regarded as the conceptual basis required for identifying and solving real-world problems through algorithmic approaches to achieve transferable solutions. developing students ct in primary school stages is essential and has received considerable attention. meanwhile, researchers incorporated digital badges into classrooms to improve students learning motivation in computer science (cs). however, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in cs education to develop students ct. therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils ct skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in cs. a quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. the results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students ct skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their ct self-efficacy or learning motivation in cs, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between ct skills and ct self-efficacy. in addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on ct skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in cs. these findings have implications for the design of digital badge educational interventions intended to promote students ct and learning motivation."
ROBLEDOCASTRO2023100563,Effects of a computational thinking intervention program on executive functions in children aged 10 to 11,"computational thinking refers to a series of cognitive processes involved in solving problems through computational systems. a growing body of studies has managed to demonstrate the correlation between computational thinking and different cognitive domains. in recent decades, multiple studies have taken place that seek to evaluate the effect of computational thinking on higher-order cognitive processes. the current study aims to contribute to this discussion by analyzing the effect of an intervention program in computational thinking on the executive functions of school-age children. in this experimental study, 30 children aged 10 and 11 were randomly assigned to an experimental group and an active control group. the instruments to collect the data were 15 tests of the neuropsychological battery of executive functions and frontal lobes banfe-2, which were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. the experimental group participated in an 8-week computational thinking intervention during which its participants enrolled in plugged and unplugged activities and carried out block programming language twice a week. the results showed that the intervention had significant effects on executive functions associated with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral cortex, but not those related to the orbitofrontal area."
MASTER2023242,Gender equity and motivational readiness for computational thinking in early childhood,"learning coding during early childhood is an effective way for children to practice computational thinking. aspects of childrens motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. gender inequities may interfere with childrens readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. societal stereotypes can reduce young girls motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. this study examined childrens gender stereotypes as well as childrens own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. we assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. there were no gender differences in childrens motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. childrens stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. these findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their genders interest in computer science."
YANG2025101752,Enhancing computational thinking assessment: A multimodal cognitive diagnostic approach,"computational thinking (ct) is an essential skill students need if they are to adapt to the rise of digital society, and the evaluation of ct is crucial for enhancing students ct. however, the current evaluation of ct is based on a summative paradigm and ignores real ct performance during the assessment process. this study thus used a multimodal cognitive diagnostic model (h-mcdm) of students ct based on multimodal data in situational tasks, to achieve precise evaluation and explore the current mastery status of students ct and their cognitive and behavioral characteristics. the research results indicate that: 1) students ct was at a moderately high level and indicated a good grasp of the ct components of problem decomposition and algorithm design, but students had not yet mastered problem abstraction, 2) a total of six different ct latent patterns were discerned in the overall student results, 3) individual students who shared the same ct latent patterns could differ in their cognitive and behavioral characteristics, while those with different ct latent patterns could share similar characteristics. this study showed that it is possible to capture the degree of students mastery of ct and their cognitive and behavioral differences with the same or different ct latent patterns at a granular level, providing a basis for developing individualized strategies to enhance students ct."

HARPER2023381,Centering teacher and parent voice to realize culturally relevant computational thinking in early childhood,"the specific mechanisms by which teachers and parents can provide culturally relevant opportunities for computational thinking for raciallyethnically and linguistically diverse groups of preschoolers remain unknown. accordingly, the purpose of this research is to examine how prek parent and teacher voice directed efforts to realize a culturally relevant computing program. we drew data sources from a subsample of design-based research meetings in which partners collaborated to co-develop the first iteration of the program. using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines. we discuss what can be learned from parent voice in regards to bolstering childrens self-expression, access to increasingly complex computational thinking tasks, and opportunities for learning cultural and community values through computing."
FALLOON2024105045,Advancing young students’ computational thinking: An investigation of structured curriculum in early years primary schooling,"in recent years, the development of computational thinking (ct) has become integral to many school curricula worldwide. this has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a 21st century competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. however, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as jeanette wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years education. this study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (blue-bots and an ipad app). results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students sequencingalgorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. while currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and cant do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years teachers professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students learning in this increasingly important area. given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (ai) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years education."

YENI2024100696,Computational thinking integrated in school subjects – A cross-case analysis of students’ experiences,"the integration of computational thinking (ct) into k-12 education offers substantial potential to improve digital literacy and deepen students understanding across various subject areas. by embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. however, the effective integration of ct into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. this study explores the impact of integrating ct into k-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. the research examines how students subject knowledge, ct concepts, and practices evolved under each ct integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward ct integrated lessons. the study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. the technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students adoption towards the different integration practices. the study revealed that different ct integration practices yield varying impacts on students attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. these insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society."
MADARIAGA2023104664,"Offline and online user experience of gamified robotics for introducing computational thinking: Comparing engagement, game mechanics and coding motivation","as we begin to identify essential skills for the future, there has been an increased focus on how to define and implement computational thinking within education. however, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. in our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. the board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. a mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. the tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. we contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking. such guidance is not only applicable in technologically rich environments; it can also be applied in educational communities with limited access to technology."
AGBO2024101458,How can unplugged approach facilitate novice students’ understanding of computational thinking? An exploratory study from a Nigerian university,"computational thinking (ct) has been relevant in teaching stem courses, and educators are incorporating both plugged and unplugged ct activities in their modules to prepare new entrants for advanced knowledge. however, additional empirical data are needed to understand how an unplugged activities approach can lead to an improved understanding of ct concepts. therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students ct skills and unravels the characteristics of students ct competency from performing unplugged activities. the experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a university in nigeria. a mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching ct could help students improve their ct competency. a paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each ct concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. furthermore, latent dirichlet allocation (lda) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students solutions. topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve ct problems. only 27.62 of students solution descriptions contained ct concepts, 56.90 of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 of students who applied ct concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly. indeed, ct unplugged activities significantly increased the number of students who gained ct competency. in addition, this study provides recommendation for computer science educators and highlight future direction."
PIATTI2022100166,The CT-cube: A framework for the design and the assessment of computational thinking activities,"computational thinking is a fundamental competence that is being introduced in k-12 and succeeding curricula worldwide. despite this huge effort, many computational thinking models in the literature do not explicitly take into consideration the pupils age and the developmental nature of computational thinking skills. furthermore, many existing computational thinking models are focused on the internal thinking processes of the individuals, failing to explicitly consider the situated nature, in terms of social context and artefactual environment, that usually characterise tasks that require computational thinking to be solved. in this paper, we present a framework for the design, realisation, analysis, and assessment of computational thinking activities, called ct-cube. the ct-cube allows to extend existing computational thinking models to consider the life-long development of computational thinking skills in individuals, from childhood to adult age, and to take into consideration the situated nature of computational thinking activities. we use the ct-cube to design an unplugged task, called cross array task (cat), allowing to assess the algorithmic skills of k-12 pupils and we show how the ct-cube can be used in this case to illustrate the development of this competence along the entire compulsory school path, considering a sample of 109 pupil aged 3 to 16 in switzerland."
YOUJUN2022101143,Computational thinking: A mediation tool and higher-order thinking for linking EFL grammar knowledge with competency,"the current single teaching and assessing modes of english as a foreign language (efl) grammar in china have caused the disconnect between grammar knowledge and competency with numerous errors in essay writing, somehow ignoring the analysis of learners thinking patterns. to solve the problem, computational thinking (ct), a higher-order thinking in solving problems and optimizing the way to acquire knowledge, was employed in the study. as needed, the experimental group was taught using the ct teaching model following ct principal elements (data analysis, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and parallelization), while the control group followed the traditional teaching mode. quantitative and qualitative data were obtained based on the pre-test-post-test, classroom observation, and questionnaire survey. the results show that the grammar application in short essay writing of all the members of the experimental group significantly improved and that higher grammar learning agency and engagement were unfolded to show the changes of thinking patterns. however, not all the members from the control group showed similar results. ct serves as an important social mediation tool in efl teaching. this study further enriches the teaching modes of grammar and is an effective attempt at introducing ct into learners thinking patterns."

NOCERINO2023112626,Computational LEED: computational thinking strategies and Visual Programming Languages to support environmental design and LEED credits achievement,"since environmental and energy issues and challenges continues to emerge as key global concerns, green building certification systems are becoming increasingly relevant in the construction industry. in this regard, leed (leadership in energy and environmental design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. however, due to the high level of complexity of the leed system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of design friendliness and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. cad, bim). this makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation andor construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. the application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. this kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific leed credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a designer friendly working environment. in particular, visual programming languages (vpls), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. the aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with vpl tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of leed credits. to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales neighbourhood and building are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology."

GUNTOSIK2024101552,The effect of computer science unplugged on abstraction as a sub-component of computational thinking,"since computational thinking is a high-level cognitive skill and its conceptual framework has not yet been clarified, the assessment of this skill is problematic. while there is no consensus in the literature about the components of computational thinking, the abstraction component is located at a point where opinions intersect. in addition, it is predicted that computer science unplugged activities will improve computational thinking, and there is limited research examining this effect. as a result, this research aims to demonstrate the alleged effects of computer science unplugged activities on abstraction skill which is considered the critical component of computational thinking. the study, which was planned with a mixed methods research design, lasted 8 weeks. quantitative data were obtained from the abstraction skill test developed by the researchers, while qualitative data were obtained from observations and task- based interviews after each activity. quantitative findings showed that computer science unplugged activities significantly improve abstraction skills and thus computational thinking. qualitative findings not only revealed that developments in the six abstracting steps caused this significant difference but also identified abstracting steps where the effect of each activity was limited. suggestions for organizing activities to improve these steps are given. finally, suggestions are presented for the conceptual framework of computational thinking based on abstraction."
ROBLEDOCASTRO2023105738,Cognitive stimulation of executive functions through computational thinking,"the healthy development of cognitive functions, including executive functions, has been shown to depend mainly on the experiences and learning opportunities of people, especially during childhood. over the past few years, researchers have been studying the impacts of diverse types of interventions on childrens cognitive development in which computational thinking programs are a recent field. this pilot study evaluated the effect of computational thinking training based on the programming for children program on the executive functions of children aged 10 and 11 years: working memory, inhibition, and planning (n 30). the results showed that children in the experimental group improved on tests of visuospatial working memory, cognitive inhibition, and sequential planning compared with the control group. however, tests of verbal working memory, memory strategy, and visual spatial planning did not show any observed changes. although this was an exploratory study, and its findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, the findings support the relevance and feasibility of conducting similar larger studies with larger samples."
YANG2025105282,A three-phase professional development approach to improving robotics pedagogical knowledge and computational thinking attitude of early childhood teachers,"computational thinking has been promoted as an impactful 21st-century skillset that can be transferred to many other disciplines and problem scenarios. with the proliferation of age-appropriate coding platforms for young children, computational thinking has become increasingly popular in early childhood settings. however, there is a lack of research on introducing coding and computational thinking to teacher training in early childhood education. to empower early childhood teachers in the digital society, this study introduced 17 early childhood teachers to robot programming and computational thinking through the ct4ece professional development program, which includes three phases: learn, practice, and reflect improve. results of pre- and post-intervention surveys revealed that the ct4ece program significantly enhanced teachers robotics and pedagogical knowledge, as well as their attitudes towards computational thinking, especially their interest in and their view of using computational thinking in classroom practice. post-intervention interviews indicated that participation in ct4ece helped educators gain a basic understanding of both coding robots and computational thinking suitable for young children due to a structured change process for teachers professional learning. this study establishes a strong foundation for enhancing and expanding the ct4ece program, ultimately equipping teachers and children with the necessary skillsets to thrive in the digital future."
CIFTCI2023101337,Improving early childhood pre-service teachers’ computational thinking skills through the unplugged computational thinking integrated STEM approach,"the purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of the unplugged computational thinking (ct) integrated stem (uct-stem) approach and stem approach on early childhood pre-service teachers ct skills (creativity, algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, cooperativity, communication). the study was conducted with a total of 70 early childhood pre-service teachers. quasi-experimental design was used; activities based on the uct-stem approach were administered to the experimental group and activities based on the stem approach were administered to the control group. post-test scores for ct skills showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the experimental group. it was concluded that the uct-stem approach was more effective in developing the pre-service teachers ct skills than the stem approach. the current study presents an important finding to the literature in terms of the developed stem and uct-stem contents and how these contents improve pre-service teachers ct skills. the stem and uct-stem content provides significant information in terms of teacher practices. at the same time, this study offers important implications for program developers and policy-makers to integrate these innovative educational approaches into both early childhood education and teacher education programs."
WANG2024104619,Teaching design students machine learning to enhance motivation for learning computational thinking skills,"the integration of computational thinking (ct) to enhance creativity in design students has often been underexplored in design education. while design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. by introducing ct alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. this study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. we developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use waikato environment for knowledge analysis (weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using weka are significantly higher than those in the group without weka. however, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. students using weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. on the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. the findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students motivation to engage with ct skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices."
TSARAVA2022104425,A cognitive definition of computational thinking in primary education,"there is increasing effort to integrate computational thinking (ct) curricula across all education levels. therefore, research on ct assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable ct assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. several ct assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. moreover, associations between ct scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. however, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. like the general concept of intelligence, ct remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. in this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of ct, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated ct test, which was initially designed for middle school students. in our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. the analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted ct assessment for primary school students. moreover, findings indicated cts positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of ct with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. in summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with ct at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with ct both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with ct from primary education level to the university level and beyond. these differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support ct abilities and ct development differentially across ages."
MARTINNUNEZ2023100128,Does intrinsic motivation mediate perceived artificial intelligence (AI) learning and computational thinking of students during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"the concept of artificial intelligence (ai), born as the possibility of simulating the human brains learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, ai has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. however, the extent of the implications of ai adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of ai in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students intrinsic motivation for learning artificial intelligence during the covid-19 pandemic; the relationship between students computational thinking and understanding of ai concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between ai and computational thinking building efforts. to investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from universidad politcnica de madrid students in the institute for educational science and the school of naval architecture and marine engineering during the first quarter of 2022. findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived artificial intelligence learning and computational thinking. also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived artificial intelligence learning."
YANG2024104962,Enhancing elementary school students' computational thinking and programming learning with graphic organizers,"computational thinking is widely recognized as an essential skill for adapting to the current era, with programming learning being the most effective means to develop it. it is recommended that computational thinking and learning programming be introduced as early as elementary school. however, elementary school students often possess limited prior knowledge of programming, posing challenges in their learning process. the graphic organizers (gos) may serve as a bridge between students existing knowledge and new learning, facilitating a deeper processing of the overall information and thereby enhancing the learning process. this can be particularly advantageous for early-stage learners when grappling with difficult subjects. consequently, this study employed gos to assist elementary school students in their computational thinking and programming learning, employing a quasi-experiment design to evaluate their effectiveness. the results showed that although all students demonstrated awareness of applying computational thinking to solve problems, those exposed to go-based instruction exhibited higher levels of computational thinking, programming skills, and flow experiences."
KONG2023107749,Monitoring cognitive development through the assessment of computational thinking practices: A longitudinal intervention on primary school students,"computational thinking (ct) practices is a critical cognitive tool for students to overcome challenges in this technological era. few studies investigated ct practices from a development perspective. a two-year intervention was implemented in 30 intervention and 22 control schools in hong kong to promote ct education (t1baseline: n 13,056; t2: n 16,367; and t3: n 15,269). senior primary students (grades 4 to 6) around 812 years old were targeted. among them, 34 were girls at t1baseline. their learning progression of cognitive development was assessed with a ct practices test. data were analyzed using item response analysis. learning trajectories of ct practices were modeled to understand how students cognitive development differed between schools. insights of findings were discussed in bringing ct practices to life."
LI2024101537,Engagement predicts computational thinking skills in unplugged activity: Analysis of gender differences,"engagement is critical to computational thinking and programming education. however, as multi-dimensional variables, when analyzing how different aspects of engagement in computational thinking tasks influence skills development, it becomes crucial to discern precisely which engagement components intersect with the progression of computational thinking skills. this discernment is pivotal because engagement can vary based on the task nature, the context, and the individuals preferences. therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the gender differences in engagement and computational thinking skills and the predictive relationships among these sub-dimensions for boys and girls in an unplugged environment. in this study, a quasi-experiment for 90 sixth-grade students from a north chinese primary school was performed. by partial least squaresstructural equation modeling, students models of computational thinking skills and engagement were analyzed, and comparisons of boys and girls were made by analysis of covariance statistics. results indicated that compared with boys, girls reported higher computational thinking performance and more engagement in unplugged contexts. furthermore, girls computational thinking skills were only predicted by their cognitive engagement, whereas boys computational thinking skills were predicted by their behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. teachers can adopt these findings to design computational thinking teaching interventions that combine the advantages of unplugged activity and focus on the engagement of boys and girls."
SOHR202392,How a child entangles empathy and computational thinking in reasoning about fairness,"in this work, we argue for expanding the scope of k-12 computational thinking (ct) integration contexts to include everyday scenarios involving moral reasoning. epistemic overlap between computational thinking practices and moral reasoning suggest that these contexts are potentially rich sites to see seeds of ct in childrens reasoning and can provide rich educational pathways for children into ct. taking a case-study approach, we examine the reasoning of a second-grader, ollie, on a task involving fair allocation of resources to victims of a natural disaster. our analysis finds that ollies reasoning was rich with seeds of ct (e.g., problem formulation, abstraction, complex-systems thinking) and that empathy served as an important supporting role to the ct. this work has implications for curricular design, suggesting that fairness and resource allocation scenarios with built-in opportunities for empathy might provide rich sandboxes for ct integration."

CATALA20131930,A meta-model for dataflow-based rules in smart environments: Evaluating user comprehension and performance,"a considerable part of the behavior in smart environments relies on event-driven and rule specification. rules are the mechanism most often used to enable user customization of the environment. however, the expressiveness of the rules available to users in editing and other tools is usually either limited or the available rule editing interfaces are not designed for end-users with low skills in programming. this means we have to look for interaction techniques and new ways to define user customization rules. this paper describes a generic and flexible meta-model to support expressive rules enhanced with data flow expressions that will graphically support the definition of rules without writing code. an empirical study was conducted on the ease of understanding of the visual data flow expressions, which are the key elements in our rule proposal. the visual dataflow language was compared to its corresponding textual version in terms of comprehension and ease of learning by teenagers in exercises involving calculations, modifications, writing and detecting equivalences in expressions in both languages. although the subjects had some previous experience in editing mathematical expressions on spreadsheets, the study found their performance with visual dataflows to be significantly better in calculation and modification exercises. this makes our dataflow approach a promising mechanism for expressing user-customized reactive behavior in ambient intelligence (ami) environments. the performance of the rule matching processor was validated by means of two stress tests to ensure that the meta-model approach adopted would be able to scale up with the number of types and instances in the space."

WESTERBERG2022105473,Home science interactions and their relation to children’s science core knowledge in preschool,"a limited body of work has examined the nature and scope of young childrens science-related activities outside of the school context, and thus there is little understanding or consensus regarding what comprises the home science environment (hse; e.g., interactions, activities, resources) and how specific factors of the hse relate to childrens science performance. the two primary goals of this study were to (a) examine the factor structure of a parent-report measure of home science interactions and (b) evaluate how these factors relate to the science core knowledge of young children from families with low incomes. a total of 125 families with children aged 3 to 5 years (52 girls) participated in the study. children were assessed on a measure of science core knowledge, and parents completed a brief questionnaire on their home science interactions that included questions pertaining to both home science disciplinary core idea (dci) engagement and home science and engineering practice (sep) engagement. findings revealed that although separating home science interactions into distinct dci and sep factors represented the data well, the best overall representation of home science interactions was a one-factor model that included only home dci engagement items. in addition, home dci engagement was significantly predictive of childrens science core knowledge over and above a large group of covariates, including childrens age, raceethnicity, sex, and performance on math, executive function, and vocabulary tasks as well as their parents education."
DELAHERA2022105335,Peer tutoring of computer programming increases exploratory behavior in children,"there is growing interest in teaching computer science and programming skills in schools. here we investigated the efficacy of peer tutoring, which is known to be a useful educational resource in other domains but never before has been examined in such a core aspect of applied logical thinking in children. we compared (a) how children (n 42, age range 7 years 1 month to 8 years 4 months) learn computer programming from an adult versus learning from a peer and (b) the effect of teaching a peer versus simply revising what has been learned. our results indicate that children taught by a peer showed comparable overall performancea combination of accuracy and response timesto their classmates taught by an adult. however, there was a speedaccuracy trade-off, and peer-taught children showed more exploratory behavior, with shorter response times at the expense of lower accuracy. in contrast, no tutor effects (i.e., resulting from teaching a peer) were found. thus, our results provide empirical evidence in support of peer tutoring as a way to help teach computer programming to children. this could contribute to the promotion of a widespread understanding of how computers operate and how to shape them, which is essential to our values of democracy, plurality, and freedom."
TAN2025100355,Artificial intelligence in teaching and teacher professional development: A systematic review,"the application of artificial intelligence (ai) technology in education is increasingly recognized as a key driver of educational innovation. while extensive literature exists on the integration of ai technologies in educational settings, less emphasis has been placed on the critical role of teachers and their professional development needs. this study systematically reviews research conducted between 2015 and 2024 on teachers use of ai technology in their teaching and professional development, focusing on the relationship between the supply of professional development opportunities and the demand for ai integration among teachers. using prisma principles and protocols, this review identified and synthesized 95 relevant research articles. the findings reveal a significant imbalance in research focus. specifically, 65 of the studies examined the application of ai in teaching, including technologies such as conversational ai and related technologies, ai-driven learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies, visual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. in contrast, only 35 of the studies explored ais role in enhancing teacher professional development. this review highlights a gap in research addressing the development needs of teachers as they integrate ai technologies into their teaching practices. it emphasizes the need for future research to focus more on the potential of ai in teacher professional development and to investigate how ai technologies can be applied in education from both the perspectives of student learning and teacher instruction. furthermore, research on ai in professional development should prioritize addressing technological and ethical challenges to ensure the responsible and effective integration of ai in education."
ROBINSON2024100087,"Infrastructural justice for responsible software engineering,","in recent years, we have seen many examples of software products unintentionally causing demonstrable harm. many guidelines for ethical and responsible computing have been developed in response. dominant approaches typically attribute liability and blame to individual companies or actors, rather than understanding how the working practices, norms, and cultural understandings in the software industry contribute to such outcomes. in this paper, we propose an understanding of responsibility that is infrastructural, relational, and cultural; thus, providing a foundation to better enable responsible software engineering into the future. our approach draws on youngs (2006) social connection model of responsibility and star and ruhleders (1994) concept of infrastructure. by bringing these theories together we introduce a concept called infrastructural injustice, which offers a new way for software engineers to consider their opportunities for responsible action with respect to society and the planet. we illustrate the utility of this approach by applying it to an open-source software communities development of deepfake technology, to find key leverage points of responsibility that are relevant to both deepfake technology and software engineering more broadly."

SUN2023100546,A systematic literature review of teacher scaffolding in game-based learning in primary education,"in recent years, research interest in games in education has experienced continuous growth. however, although prior reviews in this context have generally focused on providing an overview of research trends and the impact of game-based learning on education, they have failed to provide noncrucial information on teacher scaffolding strategies used in the different stages of game-based learning and its related effects on students learning in primary education. by conducting a systematic search of databases, the current review examines recent empirical studies, ranging from 2011 to the end of march 2022, that implemented game-based learning in primary education settings. twenty-four relevant papers were selected by deploying a four-phase prisma framework. this review identified different teacher scaffolding strategies that are used in teacherstudent interactions during the orientation and gameplay stages, and their correlative influence on students learning. these findings can help teachers, teacher educators, and game developers in designing and developing improved game-based learning. the requirement for more research to investigate the use of teacher scaffolding in teacherstudent interactions within the game-based learning process in primary education is emphasized. furthermore, recommendations are offered for the future implementation of teacher scaffolding in game-based learning research."
CAMARGO2024326,VISO approach: A socialization proposal for the Internet of Things objects,"amidst the ongoing technological expansion, iot-based applications have established their presence in various scenarios, including smart homes, healthcare, wearable devices, and more. however, fostering robust social relationships among objects within intelligent environments requires considering a multitude of parameters, from historical transactions data to peer opinions on interaction experiences. our primary objective is to introduce the viso concept, a finely tuned approach for community formation and facilitating autonomous interactions among social iot objects. key contributions of viso include: (i) a recommendation mechanism for cultivating friendships; (ii) the virtualization of devices, known as virtual objects, based on the digital twin concept; (iii) object ranking, determined by peer evaluations at the edge; and (iv) profiling the identity of each object within the environment. the viso approach is rooted in the link analysis model, which seeks to uncover connections between individuals and qualify interactions. additionally, the construction of social circles is guided by the organizational network analysis model, a concept grounded in social networks designed to simplify the initiation of new friendships. the viso approach stands out through its amalgamation of dynamic trust mechanisms, object virtualization, real-time interaction monitoring, and the highlighting of the most active objects. these characteristics collectively contribute to its effectiveness in managing relationships within the social iot, while simultaneously addressing challenges posed by alternative models. preliminary results in a testing environment substantiate the models capability to categorize interactions and identify the most beneficial object roles for establishing new relationships. in particular, by selecting the most active objects 30, they account for a staggering 90 of local actions. these validation outcomes lay the foundation for planned future work and enhancements to the viso approach. encouraged by the promising results, the inception of a significant project is on the horizon. the application of the viso approach to relationship management within a smart campus for ubiquitous education underscores the remarkable versatility and potential of social iot. this application has the power to elevate various facets of campus life, ranging from education to resource management, creating a transformative impact within the educational landscape."
PRINSLOO2023102901,"System dynamics characterisation and synthesis of floating photovoltaics in terms of energy, environmental and economic parameters with WELF nexus sustainability features","the invention of floatovoltaic technologies brought new meaning to the theoretical framing of sustainability as the technology delivers extended natural resource conservation benefits. however, planning assessments for this novel sustainable energy technology exposed knowledge gaps jeopardising global financial investments and regulatory approvals. knowledge and methodological gaps cause inaccurate performance predictions in current geospatial-engineering modelling tools and fail to adequately quantify the diverse range of layered performance qualities and impacts of floating photovoltaics. this paper advances a geo-sensitive system dynamics framework to systemically integrate the energy, environmental and economic domain object functions in characterising the behaviour and sustainability of floating photovoltaic systems theoretically. the framework serves as computer logic in a geospatial digital twin to synthesise floatovoltaic operations to predict the technologys sustainability impact and offset attributes in balanced scorecard metrics and waterenergylandfood nexus indicators. experimental evaluations with the proposed framework in a real-world setting demonstrate the value of the holistically integrated framework in analytical floatovoltaic project appraisal and planning support. the results highlight significant advantages when comparing a 1000 m2 floatovoltaic system with a similar-sized conventional photovoltaic alternative, including a 19.3 lifetime energy gain, a carbon emission displacement of co2e5168t and a freshwater evaporation benefit of 983 kl. predictive energy, environmental and economic modelling also offers waterenergylandfoodresource analysis parameters, thus delivering multi-attribute performance profiles that solve many of the current problems with the technology unknowns of floatovoltaics that impede energy project commissioning and licensing approvals."
YU2025100172,"Modular AI agents for transportation surveys and interviews: Advancing engagement, transparency, and cost efficiency","surveys and interviewsstructured, semi-structured, or unstructuredare widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. for example, distributed questionnaires lack the ability to provide real-time guidance and request immediate clarifications. recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (ai) technologies. however, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating ai agents. this issue underscors the need for a rigorous, explainable, and resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. this paper bridges this gap by introducing a modular approach accompanied by a parameterized process for designing and deploying ai agents for surveys and interviews, thereby supporting decision-makings in high-stakes contexts. we detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. we demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (english and french) capabilities; and (3) expert consultations about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. the results suggest that the ai agent increases completion rates and response quality. furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns. we believe this work lays the foundation for next-generation surveys and interviews in transportation research."

LIU2024105109,Profiling students’ learning engagement in MOOC discussions to identify learning achievement: An automated configurational approach,"in the massive online open course (mooc) forum, learning engagement encompasses three fundamental dimensionscognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagementthat intricately interact to jointly influence students learning achievements. however, the interplay between multiple engagement dimensions and their correlations with learning achievement remain understudied, particularly across different academic disciplines. this study adopts an automated configurational approach that integrates bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (bert) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca) to explore the configurations of learning engagement, their connections with learning achievement, and variations across disciplines. our analysis reveals a nuanced profile of learners learning engagement, indicating the high-achieving individuals demonstrated more frequent posting and commenting behaviors and the high-level cognitive engagement than low-achieving individuals. second, our analysis revealed multiple configurations where the coexistence or absence of factors at different levels of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions significantly impacted learning achievement. learners who conducted posting and replying behaviors, expressed positive emotions, and engaged in deep cognitive engagement tended to achieve superior learning outcomes. third, there were significant differences in behavioral and emotional engagement among learners across different academic disciplines. specifically, pure discipline learners were more inclined to engage in posting behaviors than the applied discipline learners. across academic disciplines, positive emotions correlated strongly with higher achievement. these findings deepen our understanding of the multifaceted characteristics of learning engagement in moocs and highlight the importance of disciplinary distinctions, providing a foundation for educators and designers to optimize learners mooc effects and tailor learning experiences in diverse disciplinary contexts."
CHENG2024104948,Exploring differences in self-regulated learning strategy use between high- and low-performing students in introductory programming: An analysis of eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data from program comprehension,"previous studies have reported mixed results regarding the relationship between students use of self-regulated learning (srl) strategies and their performance in introductory programming courses. these studies were constrained by their reliance on self-report questionnaires as a means of collecting and analysing data. to address this limitation, this study aimed to employ eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud techniques to identify differences in srl strategy use for program comprehension tasks between high-performing students (n 31) and low-performing students (n 31) in an undergraduate programming course. all participants attended individual eye-tracking sessions to comprehend two python program codes with different constructs. their eye-tracking data and video-recalled retrospective think-aloud data were captured and recorded for analysis. the findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills, such as elaboration and critical thinking, were mostly adopted by high-performing students, while basic cognitive and resource management strategy, such as rehearsal and help-seeking, were mostly employed by low-performing students when comprehending the program codes. this study not only demonstrates the design of combining eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data to explore students use of srl strategies but also provides evidence to support the notion that program comprehension is a complex process that cannot be effectively addressed by employing merely rudimentary strategies, such as repetitively reading the same code segment. in the future, researchers could explore the possibility of using a webcam to monitor and assess students online programming processes and provide feedback based on their eye movements. they could also examine the effects of srl strategies training on students motivation, engagement, and performance in various types of programming activities."

PUJIASTUTI20241738,The Effectiveness of Using Augmented Reality on the Geometry Thinking Ability of Junior High School Students,"this study aimed to test the effectiveness of using augmented reality applications in learning geometry in junior high school students. the method used in this study is the quasi-experiment method. in this study, researchers used learning with augmented reality to find its effect on student learning outcomes in grade 8 junior high school, which has an average age of 13 years. the research design used in this study was a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group design. this study, 2 sample classes were taken: an experimental class (learning with augmented reality) and a control class (learning without augmented reality). the experimental and control classes have the same characteristics; each has 20 male and 20 female students. the instrument used in this research is a geometric thinking ability test. this study uses a test instrument in the form of essay questions. the instrument was given twice, namely during the pretest and post-test. there are ten essay questions made. after obtaining the data from the pretest and post-test results, the normalized gain score formula (n-gain) was used to know the increase in geometric thinking skills. the n-gain result of the experimental class is 78 or 0.78, which is in the high category. whereas in the control class, it was 50 or 0.58, this result is in the moderate category. the n-gain results show that there is a difference between the experimental class and the control class. in this case, the effectiveness of using augmented reality for learning geometry in junior high school students is higher than those who did not receive augmented reality treatment. from the n-gain value, it proves that learning using augmented reality learning media is effective in increasing the ability to think geometry. then the results of observations made during learning activities using augmented reality show that students look active and make students more enthusiastic when learning geometry. the results of the responses showed that 39 students had become more proactive in learning geometry by using augmented reality applications."
KOPONEN202557,Sales managers' perceptions of interpersonal communication competence in leading AI-integrated sales teams,"adoption of artificial intelligence (ai) is no longer the issue for most professional organizationsthe question is how to integrate it into the functions and organizational processes. considering the current integration of ai in work processes, the requirements for sales managers interpersonal communication competence (icc) are likely to be modified. however, research on sales management competencies is surprisingly scarce. this longitudinal case study investigates sales managers perceptions of their icc needs in leading ai-integrated sales teams in the financial sector. during the years 20192024, 35 expert interviews with sales managers were collected from one of scandinavias largest financial groups. the findings indicate that ai system integration brought benefits, concerns and communication challenges to sales managers job content. the main components related to sales managers icc in leading ai-integrated sales teams encompass both traditional competencies (motivation, knowledge, communication skills, and adaptability) but also include contextual ai factors and a concern for ethical reflectivity. a component model of managerial interpersonal communication competence in ai-integrated teams (miccait) is produced and its implications are examined. given the greater reliance on technology, sales managers may increasingly need to place greater emphasis on their empathy and people-oriented skills for the human employees remaining in the workplace."
MAHER2025205,Reactive transport as a scientific framework,"reactive transport is a framework that integrates across disciplines and scales, and leverages cutting-edge computational techniques to advance a nuanced understanding of earths complex systems. as a way of thinking, it connects science, engineering, and natural systems, and unifies across experiment, field and modeling studies. this chapter links core reactive transport concepts to their mathematical constructs embodied in reactive transport models. approaches for scaling, such as dimensionless numbers, enable translation from conceptual to numerical models. the increasing complexity of numerical models also requires both targeted measurements and tools for evaluating and learning from multifaceted numerical models, emphasizing the importance of implementing reactive transport frameworks early in the design of any scientific study."
ROMEROORGANVIDEZ2024112150,UVLHub: A feature model data repository using UVL and open science principles,"feature models are the de facto standard for modelling variabilities and commonalities in features and relationships in software product lines. they are the base artefacts in many engineering activities, such as product configuration, derivation, or testing. concrete models in different domains exist; however, many are in private or sparse repositories or belong to discontinued projects. the dispersion of knowledge of feature models hinders the study and reuse of these artefacts in different studies. the universal variability language (uvl) is a community effort textual feature model language that promotes a common way of serializing feature models independently of concrete tools. open science principles promote transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research. although some attempts exist to promote feature model sharing, the existing solutions lack open science principles by design. in addition, existing and public feature models are described using formats not always supported by current tools. this paper presents , a repository of feature models in uvl format. provides a front end that facilitates the search, upload, storage, and management of feature model datasets, improving the capabilities of discontinued proposals. furthermore, the tool communicates with zenodo one of the most well-known open science repositories providing a permanent save of datasets and following open science principles. includes existing datasets and is readily available to include new data and functionalities in the future. it is maintained by three active universities in variability modelling."
MAHOWALD2024517,Dissociating language and thought in large language models,"large language models (llms) have come closest among all models to date to mastering human language, yet opinions about their linguistic and cognitive capabilities remain split. here, we evaluate llms using a distinction between formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic rules and patterns) and functional linguistic competence (understanding and using language in the world). we ground this distinction in human neuroscience, which has shown that formal and functional competence rely on different neural mechanisms. although llms are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance on functional competence tasks remains spotty and often requires specialized fine-tuning andor coupling with external modules. we posit that models that use language in human-like ways would need to master both of these competence types, which, in turn, could require the emergence of separate mechanisms specialized for formal versus functional linguistic competence."
KINOSHITA201616,"Wildfire, water, and society: Toward integrative research in the “Anthropocene”","across the globe, wildfires are increasing in frequency and magnitude under a warming climate, impacting natural resources, infrastructure, and millions of people every year. at the same time, human encroachment into fire-prone areas has increased the potential for ignition, as well as risks and damages to human communities. in an era of intensifying human activities on earth the anthropocene societal interactions with post-fire landscapes are becoming commonplace. yet, theories regarding post-fire impacts derived from individual disciplines no longer apply in cases where human interactions are intense. a holistic approach that accounts for interactions between natural and human systems is necessary to understand the altered dynamics of post-fire landscapes. focusing on the intersection of fire, water, and society, this paper explores an integrative research framework to couple post-fire fluvial and human processes. we review trends in wildfires and growing impacts on humans, how fluvial processes and systems are altered by wildfires, and the potential hazards for human settlements. this review forms a basis for integrating societal concerns, such as vulnerability, economic impacts, and management responses. we then link disciplinary questions into broad interdisciplinary research through an integrative framework. the 2012 waldo canyon fire (colorado, usa) provides an illustrative case with intense human interactions, both during and after the fire, to formulate critical questions within the integrative framework. utilizing emergent integrative conceptual frameworks and tools will assist scholars in meeting the challenges and opportunities for broad collaboration, which are necessary to understand and confront wildfires characteristic of the anthropocene."
DAH20239,Facilitation of Student Questioning in the Malaysian Secondary Science Classroom Using the Investigable Questioning Formulation Technique (IQFT) Protocol,"this study developed the investigable questioning formulation technique (iqft) protocol to formulate investigable questions by following the procedures of design-based research. as guiding heuristics, the protocol used two provisional design principles based on teaching experience and previous studies that have applied tools for formulating questions, notably, the question formulation technique, smart goals, and a typology of investigable and non-investigable questions. two cycles comprising six lesson interventions were completed with two groups (n 23, n 25) of students in the same school in malaysia. questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and a question typology framework. findings show the majority of students formulated comparison, exploratory, and validation of mental model questions. some questions were posed in the prediction, descriptive, and problem-solving categories, but none were categorized as cause and effect, design and make, or pattern seeking. implications for use of the iqft protocol to help facilitate malaysian students generation of investigable questions, design experiments, and implement open inquiry are discussed."

CORKIN2022104642,Are distinct modes of using digital technologies evident by age eight? Implications for digital divides.,"digital divides occur when there are inequities in access to the benefits afforded by digital technologies. originally conceptualised as inequitable access to digital technologies and internet, it is now recognised that the ways in which individuals use digital technologies and the competencies they subsequently develop may also contribute to digital divides. the aims of the current study were twofold. firstly, to investigate categories of screen media use outside of school for children at age eight, and whether children of this age fall into user typographies, whereby different modes of digital technology use have already started to emerge. secondly, to consider the implications of different modes of use at 8 years of age for the establishment of digital divides. using a sample of 5010 children participating in the growing up in new zealand study, the results of factor analysis indicated six categories of screen-based activities (social, creative, shopping, educational, entertainment, and interests), while four different modes of digital technology use were identified via cluster analysis (creative, entertainment, emergent, and limited). while entertainment users and creative users engaged with most activities on a fairly regularly basis, emergent users, and in particular, limited users, engaged with a narrower range of activities and at lower frequencies. we argue that entertainment users and creative users who engage with a broader range of activities, and engage in creative activities such as coding and programming outside of school, may be at an advantage with regard to digital divides. possible strategies to help mitigate digital divides are proposed."
QIAN201650,Game-based Learning and 21st century skills: A review of recent research,"game-based learning and 21st century skills have been gaining an enormous amount of attention from researchers and practitioners. given numerous studies support the positive effects of games on learning, a growing number of researchers are committed to developing educational games to promote students 21st century skill development in schools. however, little is known regarding how games may influence student acquisition of 21st century skills. this paper examines the most recent literature in regard to game-based learning and identified 29 studies which targeted 21st century skills as outcomes. the range of game genres and game design elements as well as learning theories used in these studies are discussed, together with the range of indicators, measures and outcomes for impacts on 21st century skills. the findings suggest that a game-based learning approach might be effective in facilitating students 21st century skill development. the paper also provides valuable insights for researchers, game designers, and educators in issues related to educational game design and implementation in general."
WANG2023100364,Evaluate the drivers for digital transformation in higher education institutions in the era of industry 4.0 based on decision-making method,"the digitalization of higher education (he) institutions and relevant issues have attracted the attention of many educational stakeholders. ict has become a subject of high importance in every context, particularly in the workplace; thus, a principal goal for universities and schools is to prepare future professionals capable of dealing with problems and searching for effective solutions by their digital competence as a key skill. in this regard, a new framework is developed to evaluate the main drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions (heis) in the era of industry 4.0. the developed framework is proposed a decision approach that can effectively use the presented information to make decisions of high rationality. this framework is applied to compute the subjective and objective criteria weights, and it is used to assess the preferences of organizations. an empirical case study to evaluate the main drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in heis is taken. according to the findings, the most significant drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in heis in the era of industry 4.0 are developing, updating, and adapting a curriculum (0.0425), integration of digital technologies for universal education (0.0420), and cloud computing (0.0419), respectively. hence, the evaluation results also show that the option higher education institution (hei)-4 has the highest overall utility degree (1.845) over different drivers for the implementation of digital transformation in heis in the era of industry 4.0. also, comparison and sensitivity investigation are made to show the superiority of the developed framework."
WILKIE2024101121,Primary students’ relational thinking and computation strategies with concrete-to-symbolic representations of subtraction as difference,"children are highly inclined to attend to the properties of numbers, operations and equality when given helpful tools for doing so. our aim was to investigate early algebraic thinking with the compensation property of equality for subtraction. we provided 22 (911-year-old) students with physical blocks for building vertical towers and conducted individual interviews with them as they completed a sequence of 15 tasks involving subtraction as difference using concrete, numeric, and symbolic representations. relational thinking was evidenced across a range of subtraction calculation skill levels. those students who could use both indirect addition and take-away strategies flexibly, depending on the size of the numbers involved, were more likely to evidence attention to generality with symbolic equations. the shift to symbolic equations elicited some students productive attempts to connect subtraction as difference and subtraction as take way but seemed to hinder others by provoking a return to take away calculations rather than relational thinking strategies."
PARK2024102705,"AI vs. human-generated content and accounts on Instagram: User preferences, evaluations, and ethical considerations","as content generated by artificial intelligence (ai) has become more accessible and higher quality, social debates have intensified. therefore, this study investigates how people perceive and evaluate ai-generated content and accounts compared to human-created accounts and content. we created instagram accounts representing ai, influencers, and the public and conducted a user study with 43 participants. the participants had difficulty distinguishing ai accounts from human ones. moreover, there were significant differences in user perceptions concerning the three account types. participants perceived the ai and influencer accounts as more attractive than the public account, and they rated the quality of ai-generated content as highly as that created by influencers. these findings suggest that the advancement of generative ai could alter the social media landscape and contribute to discussions on the characteristics and ethical problems of ai-generated content."
GONZALEZHOWARD2024102356,An examination of student epistemic agency: Students’ perspectives on and experiences with argumentation during STEM design challenges,"science and engineering practices (seps) can help students make sense of, and engage with, the natural and designed world. though using seps can support student epistemic agency, this is compromised when students do not perceive seps as meaningful to sensemaking. this study explores the relationship between students perspectives of the sep of argumentation, and the epistemic agency they exhibit. three themes emerged pertaining how students understandings of the design tasks participation framework and greater applications impacted their epistemic agency. findings suggest the importance of making explicit to students the rationales behind new student expectations to prevent pseudo-student epistemic agency, and shed light on the significance of fostering equitable classroom communities where all members are viewed as valuable and capable sensemakers."
FORD2019131,Invited review article: Where and how 3D printing is used in teaching and education,"the emergence of additive manufacturing and 3d printing technologies is introducing industrial skills deficits and opportunities for new teaching practices in a range of subjects and educational settings. in response, research investigating these practices is emerging across a wide range of education disciplines, but often without reference to studies in other disciplines. responding to this problem, this article synthesizes these dispersed bodies of research to provide a state-of-the-art literature review of where and how 3d printing is being used in the education system. through investigating the application of 3d printing in schools, universities, libraries and special education settings, six use categories are identified and described: (1) to teach students about 3d printing; (2) to teach educators about 3d printing; (3) as a support technology during teaching; (4) to produce artefacts that aid learning; (5) to create assistive technologies; and (6) to support outreach activities. although evidence can be found of 3d printing-based teaching practices in each of these six categories, implementation remains immature, and recommendations are made for future research and education policy."
ROVENOLT2019143,Chapter 11 - Incorporating Research Into Courses,"there is long-standing and widespread support for educational initiatives that introduce undergraduates to scientific research. research experiences can lead to gains in students general skills, such as oral visual and written communication, as well as more specific research-associated skills. traditionally, undergraduates have been introduced to research primarily through the apprentice model, in which undergraduates join a research group and receive one-on-one guidance from a mentor. this model, while effective, limits the number of students who can engage in research experiences and tends to be more accessible to students who are familiar with the research enterprise. there is therefore an increasing emphasis on developing opportunities for students to engage in research in credit-bearing courses, extending the benefits of research experiences to a larger and more diverse group. these course-based research experiences can provide many of the same benefits students derive from traditional undergraduate research experiences, such as increased content knowledge and analytical skills and persistence in science. this chapter describes important characteristics of course-based research experiences and provides examples that range from national programs to single courses developed by individual instructors. we end the chapter by offering practical suggestions to help instructors design an effective course-based research experience."
BERMUDEZ2023205,Designing culturally situated playful environments for early STEM learning with a Latine community,"children from underserved, minoritized, and immigrant families have less access to early out-of-school stem learning opportunities. playful learning landscapes increase the accessibility of early stem learning in everyday public spaces (e.g., bus stops, grocery stores) by merging principles of guided play and stem learning goals with local communitys values. we used community-based design research to (1) identify latine families funds of knowledge related to play, science, and math learning, and (2) create designs for playful environments merging families values and practices with guided play and stem learning principles. our design partners were 32 parents, primarily spanish-speaking immigrant mothers from mexico, and two directors of a local community organization. the design process consisted of co-design sessions, interviews, inductive thematic analysis, elaboration, playtest and feedback, and iteration. our findings showed that familismo, heritage representation, and the meaning of community spaces influenced the ways families engaged in stem learning and the learning environments they desired in their community. moreover, families stem practices were rooted in everyday experiences of playing cultural games, family food routines, and outdoor activities. incorporating latine parents in the design process and leveraging their funds of knowledge resulted in culturally situated designs aligned with playful and stem learning principles. this study contributes to knowledge of latine families values and practices that can help create home-community connections to strengthen childrens learning."

RAMOSVEGA2021100405,Stimulating children’s engagement with an educational serious videogame using Lean UX co-design,"the motivation to stimulate childrens learning engagement could be found in the fact that learning is not always motivational in itself. this is particularly true when learning is obligatory and based upon material that has not been chosen by the children themselves. a lean ux approach to the co-design of an educational serious videogame (mobi) is proposed in this paper. the core idea is that childrens natural interest in playing can be stimulated by engendering the feeling that they are participating in the creation of something. the hypothesis is that this approach can increase the childrens level of engagement and can facilitate their awareness of their learning perception. with the aim of testing this hypothesis, this paper describes an experience with 50 children with ages between 10 and 12 years old. the results indicate that the childrens satisfaction grew significantly during the process, with an important reduction in the requests for changes and that 60 had the perception of having learned. it can be concluded that the co-design based upon a lean ux methodology, of a childrens educational serious videogame increases their level of product engagement and facilitates their awareness of their learning perception."
ZHENG2020103669,Profiling self-regulation behaviors in STEM learning of engineering design,"engineering design is a complex process which requires science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (stem) knowledge. students self-regulation plays a critical role in interdisciplinary tasks. however, there is limited research investigating whether and how self-regulation leads to different learning outcomes among students in engineering design. this study analyzes the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade u.s. students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. it classifies the students into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform best in the task. cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. in contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. the results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort. the results also offer new insights into stem education and self-regulated learning with emerging learning analytics."

XU2022101985,FaNDS: Fake News Detection System using energy flow,"recently, the term fake news has been broadly and extensively utilized for disinformation, misinformation, hoaxes, propaganda, satire, rumors, click-bait, and junk news. it has become a serious problem around the world. we present a new system, fands, that detects fake news efficiently. the system is based on several concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. there are two main concepts: an inconsistency graph and energy flow. the inconsistency graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions between them for edges. energy flow assigns each node an initial energy and then some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on all nodes converges. to illustrate fands we use the original data from the fake news challenge (fnc-1). first, the data has to be reconstructed in order to generate the inconsistency graph. the graph contains various subgraphs with well-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the news items. then the energy flow method is applied. the nodes with high energy are the candidates for being fake news. in our experiments, all these were indeed fake news as we checked each using several reliable web sites. we compared fands to several other fake news detection methods and found it to be more sensitive in discovering fake news items."
XIE2020297,"The information impact of network media, the psychological reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, and online knowledge acquisition: Evidence from Chinese college students","this study focuses on whether network media information about the covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the online knowledge acquisition of college students. this research is of great significance, as it can have a profound impact on the way we think about knowledge acquisition in the future. yet, a recent literature review finds that the academic community has not paid attention to this important topic. in the present work, which is based on a survey of 5000 chinese college students during the covid-19 pandemic period, we find that covid-19 information from mainstream chinese media and overseas media as well as social media has had a significant promoting effect on the online knowledge acquisition of college students. at the same time, the psychological response to the pandemic situation is shown to have had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between the information impact from mainstream chinese and overseas media and the online knowledge acquisition of college students. our findings have shown that the more positive college students are in responding to the pandemic, the stronger their willingness is to acquire knowledge through online means, and the better effect this will have on them acquiring knowledge. the results of this paper have important implications for the optimization and improvement of college students education and knowledge acquisition methods in the context of the long-term covid-19 pandemic."

GAASEDELEN2019201,Chapter 8 - 3D Graphics to Virtual Reality in Medicine: Opportunities and Prospective,"today, in medicine, performing a procedure on a human requires complex anatomical and physiological knowledge, including 3d relational and physical properties. all commonly employed imaging modalities attempt to recapitulate this information in some useable form. each technique, however, can only retrieve a small slice of spatial, temporal, or conceptual knowledge of the body area of interest. furthermore, in some cases like computed tomography, a large amount of information is gathered without a clear strategy for manual or automated analysis. current software developments are slowly realizing a convergence of medical imaging methodologies toward one of greater realism. for the purposes of this chapter, this coming together of disciplines will be delineated as the field of 3d graphics. although this is a simplification, 3d graphics will be the primary foundation for a much larger hybridized field whose aim will be the creation of informative and accurate medical spatial representations. to understand how this will affect the clinical fields, we will need to first explore 3d graphics more holistically, delving into areas of physical simulation, 3d movie rendering, video game development, and the expansion of 3d visualization hardware. as we explore these fields, we will relate each of these subdomains to analogous examples in the medical field, also documenting opportunities for commercialization and innovation."

LIN2023104762,A review of using multilevel modeling in e-learning research,"improving e-learning involves various levels of supports. accordingly, researchers usually adopt complex research designs with a multilevel structure or repeated measurements to capture a heuristic view of learners perceptions, comprehension, and behavior in e-learning settings. a total of 76 studies with hierarchical linear modeling (hlm) as a multilevel modeling technique in 13 major e-learning journals from january 2000 to september 2022, published in the web of science, were reviewed. we assessed the applications of the following key criteria: reasons for using hlm, data characteristics, sample characteristics, model characteristics, variables used in the research, software use, and main technology used in the research. the results revealed that two-level models and random-intercept models are mostly used in multilevel model building. moreover, most e-learning studies included two-level random intercept models with students as sampling units of analysis in level 1, and cognitive learning (i.e., examination score, learning achievement) as the dependent variable in level 1. based on our review results, we provide suggestions and potential applications of using multilevel modeling in e-learning studies."
BOCK2020100960,On the semantics for spreadsheets with sheet-defined functions,"we give an operational semantics for the evaluation of spreadsheets, including sheet-defined and built-in numeric functions in the funcalc spreadsheet platform. the semantics allows for different implementations and we discuss sheet-defined functions implemented using both interpretation and run-time code generation. the semantics specifies the expected result of a computation, also considering non-deterministic functions, independently of an evaluation mechanism. it can be extended to include the cost of formula evaluation for a cost analysis e.g. for use in parallelization of computations. an interesting future direction is to investigate experimentally how close our semantics is to that of major spreadsheet implementations."
KOUTROMANOS2023100028,Augmented reality smart glasses use and acceptance: Α literature review,"the research interest in the use of augmented reality smart glasses (arsgs) has increased dramatically in recent years as they are utilised in many fields such as medicine and industry, as well as everyday life. this study aims to review the empirical research activity concerning the acceptance of arsgs in all applicable fields. in total, 21 studies published from 2015 to 2022 have been reviewed. their relative field, theoretical framework, methodological design, and the factors that were found to affect the acceptance or use of arsgs were recorded. it was found that the research focuses more on users acting as consumers of the glasses than on professionals (e.g., doctors, teachers, athletes) using them in a specific field. also, the majority of the studies base their theoretical framework either entirely or in part on the technology acceptance model (tam). moreover, the research models of these studies extend tam by using various additional variables, such as privacy risk and external influence. methodologically speaking, most of the studies follow the quantitative approach, without giving the participants the opportunity to interact with the glasses. in addition, the factors which were found to influence the acceptance or use of the glasses are varied and can be categorised as utilitarian, social, personal, risk-related, and technological. this review adds value to the theory of technology acceptance. this is because it is one of the first to address the acceptance or use of arsgs. since there is no acceptance model for arsgs, the findings of this review could lead researchers to propose models for accepting arsgs in various fields, such as education."
SOUTHGATE201919,"Embedding immersive virtual reality in classrooms: Ethical, organisational and educational lessons in bridging research and practice","increasing numbers of children and young people are experiencing immersive virtual reality as part of leisure and schooling. immersive virtual reality mediated through head-mounted displays presents significant challenges as well as tantalising opportunities for learning within schools. the purpose of this paper is to report on key issues that arose when embedding immersive virtual reality for learning into ict and science classes in low-income high schools by providing a fine-grained account of how the research team negotiated scholarly and practical problems. the mixed method research used a participatory approach with teachers as co-researchers. three areas are explored: (i) the ethical and safety issues of using ivr in classrooms; (ii) negotiating the organisational context of a school system and problem-solving within the context of institutional restrictions on internet access; and (iii) educational reflections on collaborative learning and gendered dynamics. we conclude that classrooms, as socially active and sometimes unpredictable places, yield unique and credible insights into the deployment of highly immersive virtual reality for learning."
FALLOON2019138,Using simulations to teach young students science concepts: An Experiential Learning theoretical analysis,"early research investigated young students understandings of science concepts using physical equipment, but technological advances now mean there are new options to introduce these ideas, through devices such as ipads and simulations. however, research investigating the use of simulations in early years science learning is limited. this study applied revisions of kolbs experiential learning theoretical model to determine if age-indicated science simulations were effective for teaching 5 year olds simple circuit building procedures and electricity concepts, and the function of circuit components. it also explored whether their engagement with the simulations provided worthwhile opportunities to exercise higher order capabilities such as reflective thinking and abstraction skills oftencited in literature as valuable outcomes from older student and adult use of simulations. findings indicate students developed a solid base of procedural knowledge about constructing different circuits, and functional knowledge about circuit components they applied to different circuit designs. the emergence of tentative, generalised theories about current and the effects of different circuit designs on the performance of resistors - linked to the exercise of reflective and descriptive thinking, were also noted in many students. however, examples were found of some simulations appearing to foster common misconceptions, such as current being consumed by resistors indicating teachers need to be highly vigilant and work closely with students, to ensure accurate understandings are developed. overall, with appropriate teacher support and careful selection and review, the study concludes simulations can be effective for introducing young students to simple physical science concepts, and for providing them with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking processes."
CARVALHO2016169,Origins and evolution of enactive cognitive science: Toward an enactive cognitive architecture,"this paper presents a historical perspective on the origin of the enactive approach to cognitive science, starting chronologically from cybernetics, with the aim of clarifying its main concepts, such as enaction, autopoiesis, structural coupling and natural drift; thus showing their influences in computational approaches and models of cognitive architecture. works of renowned authors, as well as some of their main commentators, were addressed to report the development of enactive approach. we indicate that the enactive approach transcends its original context within biology, and at a second moment within connectionism, changes the understanding of the relationships so far established between the body and the environment, and the ideas of conceptual relationships between the mind and the body. the influence on computational theories is of great importance, leading to new artificial intelligence systems as well as the proposition of complex, autopoietic and alive machines. finally, the article stresses the importance of the enactive approach in the design of agents, understanding that previous approaches have very different cognitive architectures and that a prototypical model of enactive cognitive architecture is one of the largest challenges today."
GURSOY201529,"Visualizing making: Shapes, materials, and actions","the increasing interest in materiality currently challenges the long existing traditions that consider visual thinking as the primary actor in design creativity. shape grammars offer a formalism to represent visual reasoning in design, which is never purely limited to the visual aspects of design processes. aiming to develop ways to explicitly include material manipulation in a computational formalism, we report on an ongoing exploration of how shape computation extends beyond abstract visual shapes to incorporate material shapes that have a physical existence. we present a materially informed process with shape rules and show that we can apply these rules creatively to explore the physical character of the material."
PARK2025101119,Code suggestions and explanations in programming learning: Use of ChatGPT and performance,"this study investigates the role of generative artificial intelligence (ai) chatbots, particularly chatgpt, in enhancing programming education for university students, specifically in big data analytics. the research addresses the growing need for innovative educational practices, especially in developed east asian countries like south korea, where declining university enrollment presents new challenges. using a sample size of n 343 students, this mixed-methods research employed controlled experiments and surveys to compare student performance in programming tasks across three groups: those using chatgpt, those using stack overflow, and a control group without external assistance. results showed that students using chatgpt significantly outperformed those relying on stack overflow or no assistance, particularly in hands-on coding tasks. this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on ai in education by providing empirical evidence of generative ais effectiveness in improving learning outcomes and engagement, while also highlighting the challenges associated with integrating ai into educational settings. the findings emphasize the potential of chatgpt to personalize learning experiences, improve performance, and offer real-time support, underscoring the need for a balanced curriculum design that incorporates ai while maintaining academic integrity and human oversight."
GUGGEMOS2022104552,Learners don't know best: Shedding light on the phenomenon of the K-12 MOOC in the context of information literacy,"massive open online courses (moocs) have received much attention in higher education; however, evidence about moocs at the k-12 level is scarce. to shed light on the phenomenon, we use the i-mooc that aims at fostering upper secondary level students information literacy. the i-mooc is a blended mooc developed and refined in a design research process; it meets established criteria for high-quality moocs. in 2020, 1032 upper secondary level students in german-speaking switzerland took the i-mooc; the sample comprises n 167 students who voluntarily filled in a questionnaire. the students are mainly from high schools and vocational schools. learning effects are captured with a performance test. information literacy gains are significant and medium in size: d 0.75. the technology acceptance of students is evaluated using the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut2). student technology acceptance of k-12 moocs is primarily driven by hedonic motivation, i.e., perceived fun and entertainment. however, this type of motivation negatively predicts learning gains. implications for teachers and educational decision makers are discussed."
OH2023100602,Making computing visible & tangible: A paper-based computing toolkit for codesigning inclusive computing education activities,"mcvt (making computing visible and tangible) cards are a toolkit of paper-based computing cards intended for use in the codesign of inclusive computing education. working with groups of teachers and students over multiple design sessions, we share our toolkit, design drivers and material considerations; and use cases drawn from a week-long codesign workshop where seven teachers made and adapted cards for their future classroom facilitation. our findings suggest that teachers valued the mcvt toolkit as a resource for their own learning and perceived the cards to be useful for supporting new computational practices, specifically for learning through making and connecting to examples of everyday computing. critically reviewed by teachers during codesign workshops, the toolkit however posed some implementation challenges and constraints for learning through making and troubleshooting circuitry. from teacher surveys, interviews, workshop video recordings, and teacher-constructed projects, we show how teachers codesigned new design prototypes and pedagogical activities while also adapting and extending paper-based computing materials so their students could take advantage of the unique technical and expressive affordances of mcvt cards. our design research contributes a new perspective on using interactive paper computing cards as a medium for instructional materials development to support more inclusive computing education."
BRAME201915,Chapter 2 - Course Design: Making Choices About Constructing Your Course,"designing or redesigning a course can be a creative and rewarding effort, but it is always a challenge. science is characterized by continuous change and an ever-growing (and already large) body of knowledge, and our courses often seek to help students understand the core knowledge, experimental tools, and ways of thinking in a field. its a big task. further, a course may play a particular role in the curriculum, serving as a prerequisite, a capstone, or the course in which students learn a particular skill. how do you pick on what to focus, and how do you organize your course to help your students be able to transfer their knowledge to a new setting how can you design the course to help your students build a conceptual framework that can expand and grow as their understanding grows this chapter describes six principles to guide your course design and provides suggestions for more detailed resources."
MAO2024100923,The effects of dynamic and static feedback under tasks with different difficulty levels in digital game-based learning,"to provide more useful feedback strategies in dgbl, this study investigated the effects of dynamic feedback (feedback contents adjusted to game task difficulty) and static feedback (the same feedback contents for all tasks) on students learning by using an educational programming game with easy to difficult game tasks. in addition, a lag sequence analysis was used to analyze the behavior patterns of learners. a sample of 105 university students were randomly assigned to four feedback treatment conditions. the results showed that dynamic feedback, with feedback contents appropriately adjusted to the task difficulty levels (i.e., simple hints after easy game tasks and detailed explanations after difficult game tasks), were more effective in enhancing students learning achievement and gaming engagement. furthermore, we also found that providing detailed explanations after both easy and difficult game tasks led to a decrease in learners engagement. the implications of findings and future research directions are discussed."
WONG2023103752,Mutually complementary effects of cyberloafing and cyber-life-interruption on employee exhaustion,"currently, people are accustomed to cyberloafing, or nonwork-related cyber activities during working hours, and cyber-life-interruption, or work-related cyber activities during nonworking hours. job or personal demands no longer rely on either work- or nonwork-related domain resources. we propose a dynamic demands-resources model regarding cyberloafing and cyber-life-interruption to elucidate their direct and interaction effects on work and nonwork exhaustion. by identifying these dynamics, this study can enable both employees and employers to utilize these activities for better management of employee experiences in the technology-enabled flexible working environment, which, in turn, would bring about significant implications for employee job performance."
SAIKKONEN2021104206,Multivariate analysis of teachers’ digital information skills - The importance of available resources,"digital information skills are prerequisites for success in the information society. previous research on 21st century skills has shown that digital skills evolve sequentially, building on digital information skills, making them the key to future skills that teachers should acquire and be able to pass on to future generations. in the research on digital skills, shortcomings of bivariate approaches have been widely identified and interest has largely shifted to multivariate methods. however, the development of effective targeted interventions still requires a deeper understanding of the social resources of individuals and the interdependencies of predictors. this study examined the extent to which sociodemographic factors and available resources predict digital information skills and which subgroups emerge as potential targets for interventions, by analysing the interdependence of the predictor variables. the empirical data used in the study consisted of 4988 finnish teachers questionnaire responses and performance test results. utilising the multiple regression analysis, the study found that digital activity and age explain most of the variation in teachers digital information skills. their effect was found to be the inverse of each other, with abundant digital activity increasing and age reducing teachers mastery of these skills. digital self-efficacy and in-service training also emerged as promising predictors, highlighting that teachers information skills are explained more strongly by the available resources than by sociodemographic factors. at the end, the practical significance and recommendations for more targeted interventions as well as for further research are considered on the basis of the results obtained."
IVANISHCHENKO2024e28704,Understanding factors affecting fundamental school teachers’ use of technology in Luxembourg through a survey study,"over the last few decades, information and communication technologies (ict) have brought about significant disruptions across nearly every industry, including education. acknowledging the power of the digital revolution to make a positive change, educational policy makers in luxembourg have made efforts to translate these trends into policies leveraging the potential of technologies while also tackling the challenges they present. however, these efforts and their impact on teacher ict integration behaviors in luxembourg are rather underexplored. the aim of the study was to examine and understand factors associated with efficient educational technology practices. the study data were collected through an online survey of 159 teachers and analyzed through a mixed-method approach, including regression and correlation analyses. findings shed light on the connections between professional use of ict and a set of interrelated factors such as (a) teacher attitudes followed by (b) subjective norms, (c) teacher self-efficacy beliefs, (d) facilitating conditions, (e) teacher value beliefs, and (f) fundamental pedagogical beliefs. the study also revealed possible deterrents and challenges of ict integration in luxembourgish fundamental schools, including gaps between teacher ict competencies and advanced ict uses, class management issues, and developed suggestions for professional development training to ensure efficient and advanced ict uses in the classroom."
FRALIN2017117,Chapter 9 - Building Knowledge Together: Interactive Course Exhibits in the Academic Library,"the course exhibit initiative at the virginia polytechnic institute state university (virginia tech) libraries is a program in which museum-like exhibits are built and displayed in the main learning commons. these exhibits are based on the output of students coursework, usually from a single course. students in featured courses have an opportunity to share their work that they would not otherwise have. the exhibits are designed so that students can inhabit them as they would any other space in the library. the intent is to create a space where any student may come and experience a course they may not otherwise have the chance to take. this chapter covers the origin of the program, the pedagogical implications, and a walkthrough of the design process for the exhibits."
TORPEGAARD2022100435,Preschool children’s social and playful interactions with a play-facilitating cardboard robot,"robots are increasingly finding roles in contexts involving children, including companions in therapy and education. childrens perceptions of and interactions with robots is a well-researched topic, but more focus is needed on the important role of play in childrobot interaction. play is essential to how children experience the world and thereby presents both opportunities and challenges for designers who aim to create positive experiences for children involving robots. we present a study investigating how a simple play-facilitating cardboard robot becomes a social interface and create meaningful and playful experiences for preschool children. we observed 214 children engaged in free play with the robot. the analysis produced four social interaction themes and five play patterns, illustrating the most salient reactions. the results show that the robot was successful in enabling play and that the children indeed treated the robot both as a social agent, but also as a material object. in line with existing research, our observations suggest that the children attributed both animate and inanimate properties to the robot, possibly explaining the duality of the observed playground behavior. we use these findings to provide four implications for the design of play-facilitating robots."
CAKIR2021100812,The effect of robotic coding education on preschoolers’ problem solving and creative thinking skills,"the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of robotics and coding instruction on preschoolers problem-solving skills and creative thinking abilities. designed as a quasi-experimental research with pretestposttest control groups, this study was conducted in a preschool in amasya province of turkey. a total of 40 preschool students were recruited in this study. the data were collected through the problem-solving skill scale (psss) and the creative thinking abilities test. the experimental procedure lasted for four weeks, and a total of 32 -h lesson was conducted. during the procedure in the experimental group, wedo 2.0 educational robotics kit was employed, while pen and paper activities were conducted in the control group. the participants in the experimental group performed glowingsnail, moovingsatellite, spacecraft, milo science, milos motion sensory robot, and frog robot activities, whereas those in the control group read such stories as winnie the witch under the sea, where do emotions and broken hearts go, the aliens activity, and timing, and listened to the planets song. the results show that robotics and coding instruction has provided statistically significant contribution to preschoolers problem-solving skills compared to the pen and paper activities. further, imagination and originality factors in the language domain as well as completion, new elements addition, and unconventionality factors in the drawing domain were found to be statistically significant compared to the other factors. several limitations and recommendations are provided."
HUANG2022104577,Trends and exemplary practices of STEM teacher professional development programs in K-12 contexts: A systematic review of empirical studies,"stem teachers are critical mediators of knowledge, and their performance can directly impact students learning experiences and knowledge acquisition. to ensure the quality of stem instruction, countries worldwide have launched stem teacher professional development (tpd) programs. it is paramount to know how these programs have been implemented and what lessons can be learned from them. in this study, to capture the trends in publications on k-12 stem tpd, we systematically reviewed relevant journal papers published in the web of science database from 2006 to 2020. we analyzed the (1) knowledge foci, (2) professional development approaches, (3) outcome measurements, as well as (4) data sources of the stem tpds. in addition, to inform future professional development designs, we selected and developed narrative descriptions of three exemplary cases. these cases showcased high-quality tpd and covered pre-service and in-service teachers in formal and informal settings. we reviewed the knowledge foci of the stem tpds using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (tpack) framework. the results showed that the types of knowledge delivered in the stem tpd programs were mostly pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, while a certain number of programs focused on technological content knowledge and technological pedagogical content knowledge. most of the studies adopted mixed professional development approaches, featuring activities like learning by design, learning by doing, reflective learning, and group work. these approaches emphasized the active participation of teachers in the process, built links between content and classroom practices, and encouraged collective participation in developing expertise. however, the data were mostly collected through interviews or survey instruments. future research should move beyond analyzing data on teachers perceptions to explore processes (e.g., online participation logs, teacher-peer interactions) and products of performance (e.g., lesson plans, handmade crafts) to further examine the effects of stem tpd activities. it would also be desirable to establish greater consistency in data collection approaches, such as by using validated interview or observation protocols that are generalizable to different school settings."
JINNA2025104141,Bias in online reviews: The roles played by consumers and products in reviewing online games,"prior research on online reviews has focused on investigating either the bias inherent in providing these reviews or the characteristics of users or products that lead to positive reviews. this study is different in that it controls for self-selection bias and incorporates both consumer and product characteristics, thereby providing a more realistic and holistic view of their impact on both the volume and the valence of reviews. we explore these issues in the context of a rapidly growing industryonline gamesand use an uncensored dataset of game purchasers from a large online gaming platform. we examine consumer characteristics including friendship, ownership, and usage and product characteristics such as age, atypicality, and price. we draw on theories from information systems, marketing, and sociology to explain review and rating behaviors and create consumer segments by using the products atypicality attributes to calculate consumers atypicality and variety-seeking levels. by distinguishing between review propensity (volume) and likelihood of a positive review (valence), we conclude that controlling for the propensity to review changes the previously held orthodoxy regarding the likelihood of a positive review. by exploring a more complete set of explanatory factors and testing our hypotheses on a large, uncensored dataset, our work provides a clearer picture of the intermingled influence of consumer and product characteristics on the provision of online reviews and their valence."
BRESSAN2020104475,Evaluation of machine learning methods for lithology classification using geophysical data,"specific computational tools assist geologists in identifying and sorting lithologies in well surveys and reducing operational costs and practical working time. this allows for the management of professional output, the efficient interpretation of data, and completion of scientific research on data collected in geologically distinct regions. machine learning methods and applications integrate large sets of information with the goal of efficient pattern recognition and the capability of leveraging accurate decision making. the objective of this study is to apply machine learning methods to the supervised classification of lithologies using multivariate log parameter data from offshore wells from the international ocean discovery program (iodp). according to the analysis of the lithologies proposed in the iodp expeditions and for the application of our methods, the lithologies were divided into four groups. the iodp expeditions were organized into four templates for better results in analyzing the set of expeditions and practical application of the methods. the templates were submitted to training, validation, and testing by multilayer perceptron (mlp), decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (svm) methods. the evaluation was randomly divided into training (70), validation (10), and testing (20) using the classification methods as an evaluation of the results. in the results, it was observed that template1 (iodp expedition 362) obtained better results with the mlp method, template2 (iodp expeditions 354, 355, and 359) and template3 (iodp expeditions 354, 355, 359, and 362) obtained better results with the random forest method with greater than 80.00 accuracy. for cross-validation, the random forest method performed well in all scenarios. in the practical template, the g2 group obtained a better result with the mlp method with an average accuracy above 85.00. it is expected that machine learning methods can help improve the study of geology with accurate and rapid answers related to interpreting collected data in different study regions."
RAHIMI2024100258,The role of ChatGPT readiness in shaping language teachers' language teaching innovation and meeting accountability: A bisymmetric approach,"there are some dichotomies surrounding chatgpts application and impact on education as a central part of artificial intelligence (ai) integration. problems concerning negative preconceptions and the limited usage of this form of ai have been reported, as some teachers perceive it as a competitor. this is due to insufficient readiness for its integration and a lack of understanding of how it can facilitate teaching innovation. due to this, the researchers applied a bisymmetric approach, where necessity conditional analysis (nca) as a symmetrical approach employs necessity logic to identify the must-have factors required for language teachers passing accountability, while pls-sem as an asymmetrical approach follows additive sufficiency logic to identify the should-have factors that contribute to helping them to pass their accountability. applying this approach would generate more results from different perspectives in chatgpt readiness and language teaching innovation with it. in this line, the researchers randomly explored 124 iranian in-service language teachers chatgpt readiness and their teaching innovation in helping them pass the external and internal language teaching competencies. the result of the pls-sem showed that the more the language teachers were ready to practically use chatgpt alongside, aware of its opportunities and challenges in english language teaching (elt), the more they could generate more language teaching methods and approaches with it, apply them to their language teaching procedures, and share them with their colleagues. moreover, their generational language teaching methods with chatgpt mediated the correlation between chatgpt readiness and meeting internal accountability. additionally, the nca showed that the generation of language teaching methods with chatgpt and their implementation through it were among the necessary factors that help language teachers meet both internal and external accountability by teaching language with chatgpt. based on these findings, the researchers recommended that stakeholders shift their focus from ai programming to ai teaching, especially for elt."
WIESE2025100405,AI ethics education: A systematic literature review,"the potential of ai technology to transform human life, well-being, and daily work is faced with numerous risks and challenges yet to be fully accounted for. however, the complexity of ai ethics makes it hard to pin down what to teach, how to teach it, and how to assess its effectiveness. drawing on an educational perspective, this paper presents a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of the early years of ai ethics education as a formalized field to analyze whether its future trajectory is aligned with educational best practices. our review highlights core challenges in ai ethics education and the content, assessment, and pedagogy used in real interventions over recent years. we find that efforts to teach ai ethics do helpfully draw on a holistic view (as opposed to a narrow view), and utilize progressive pedagogies like case studies and group projects that aim to meaningfully challenge students ethical reasoning skills in applied practices. however, many real- world ai ethics teaching interventions do not leverage well-supported assessment techniques known to support student learning; rather, assessment is conducted primarily for research evaluative purposes. this gap in rigorous assessment raises implications for researchers and practitioners, as responsible development and use of ai will be stymied if educators cannot successfully determine whether students have truly learned relevant ai ethics content or skills."
BARTON201242,Looking for the future in the past: Long-term change in socioecological systems,"the archaeological record has been described as a key to the long-term consequences of human action that can help guide our decisions today. yet the sparse and incomplete nature of this record often makes it impossible to inferentially reconstruct past societies in sufficient detail for them to serve as more than very general cautionary tales of coupled socio-ecological systems. however, when formal and computational modeling is used to experimentally simulate human socioecological dynamics, the empirical archaeological record can be used to validate and improve dynamic models of long term change. in this way, knowledge generated by archaeology can play a unique and valuable role in developing the tools to make more informed decisions that will shape our future. the mediterranean landscape dynamics project offers an example of using the past to develop and test computational models of interactions between land-use and landscape evolution that ultimately may help guide decision-making."
OPRISAN2022101642,Interdisciplinary curriculum for computational neuroscience at primarily undergraduate institutions,"developing interdisciplinary undergraduate courses is challenging at all levels; it requires involving trained faculty who can successfully cover more than one discipline and creating a new curriculum that crosses discipline boundaries. while such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. however, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. as part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called biophysical modeling of excitable cells (bmec). the course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. it focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy, and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. this course also provides pedagogical experience for senior ph.d. students in neuroscience. bmec is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. the class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biologypsychology and physicsmathematics oriented. the teamwork allows students with more substantial biologypsychology backgrounds to explain to physicsmathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. simultaneously, students with substantial physicsmathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes. this study expands on oprisan (2021) by including examples of hands-on activities, student projects, and a brief overview of course assessment tools and results. this study also includes more recent approaches to teaching computational neuroscience using cloud computing."
MURAI2024100631,Making as an opportunity for classroom assessment: Canadian maker educators’ views on assessment,"a growing number of studies have shown that the exploratory, collaborative, and contextualized nature of maker activities create opportunities for learners to engage with knowledge in a uniquely different way from traditional education which largely relies on de-contextualized instructions. the increased integration of making into k-12 curricula has enormous implications not only for instructional design but also for assessment practices. maker-oriented activities have the potential to shed light on types of learning that previous assessment systems have not captured and examined. nevertheless, little is discussed on how making can contribute to the assessment and instructional practices at large. this case study investigated educators experiences with assessment in classrooms integrating maker activities. through a qualitative analysis of interviews with six k-12 educators in canada, the researchers examined: (1) in what ways does making activities create opportunities for assessment and instruction in k-12 classrooms (2) in what ways does maker learning become a challenge for assessment and instruction in k-12 classrooms our analysis revealed several ways in which teachers experienced the advantages of the making approach for understanding student learning and for helping students become further aware of their own progress. the results also revealed challenges to conducting assessments for maker learning, including administrative challenges like continuing to gain support from the administration, and literacy challenges such as students obsession with letter grades. this study provides insights into how making may help improve assessment and instructional practices in k-12 classrooms."
VANDERSTAP2024105103,Towards teaching strategies addressing online learning in blended learning courses for adult-learners,"blended learning offers a learner-centred approach that employs both in-class learning and digital technology to facilitate online learning. such an approach is especially advantageous to adult-learners in higher education as it meets their educational needs. however, adult-learners participation in blended learning programmes remains challenging due to a general lack of online interaction, and no clear teaching strategies that address this concern. literature relating to adult-learners educational needs and online interaction was consulted in order to design teaching strategies that foster adult-learners online interaction. the aim of this study is to further validate these teaching strategies, hence a multiple case study was carried out using a mixed method approach. as such, eight teachers and sixteen students from four courses across three universities in belgium and the netherlands were interviewed. additionally, a questionnaire testing a pre-defined set of variables was distributed to 84 students. the results lead to a set of validated teaching strategies that help teachers to further develop their professional skills and expertise. the teaching strategies can be grouped into three categories, namely 1) the teachers online presence, 2) collaborative learning activities and preparatory learning activities, and 3) the distribution of learning content and learning activities across online and in-class learning. an elaborate set of validated teaching strategies is included. this study aids towards teacher professional development and adds evidence-based knowledge to teaching strategies and instructional frameworks for adult-learners in higher education. teachinglearning strategies, adult-learning, cooperativecollaborative learning, teacher professional development, online learning."
EIJKHOUT2018120,Teaching distributed memory programming from mental models,"distributed memory programming, typically through the mpi library, is the de facto standard for programming large scale parallelism, with up to millions of individual processes. its dominant paradigm of single program multiple data (spmd) programming is different from threaded and multicore parallelism, to an extent that students have a hard time switching models. in contrast to threaded programming, which allows for a view of the execution with central control and a central repository of data, spmd programming has a symmetric model where all processes are active all the time, with none privileged, and where data is distributed. this model is counterintuitive to the novice parallel programmer, so care needs to be taken how to instill the proper mental model. adoption of an incorrect mental model leads to broken or inefficient code. we identify problems with the currently common way of teaching mpi, and propose a structuring of mpi courses that is geared to explicit reinforcing the symmetric model. additionally, we advocate starting from realistic scenarios, rather than writing artificial code just to exercise newly-learned routines."
JUNG2017291,Intrusion of software robots into journalism: The public's and journalists' perceptions of news written by algorithms and human journalists,"this study adopted a two (author: algorithm or journalist) by two (notification of author: real or inverse) between subject design to investigate how the public and journalists perceive the quality of algorithms-written articles compared with human journalists work. findings showed that both the public and journalists evaluations were varied by the manipulation of author notification. that is, the public gave higher scores to the algorithms work when it was notified as the real author, but they gave lower scores to the algorithms work when the author was notified as a journalist. it confirmed the publics negative attitude toward journalists credibility and craving for new information and communication technology (ict) productsservices in korea. based on journalists resistance to change and innovation and the theory of prejudice, it was expected that journalists would be favorable to another journalists work and unfavorable to an algorithms work. however, contrary to the hypothetical expectation, journalists also gave higher scores to an algorithms work and lower scores to a journalists work. implications relating to the intrusion of algorithm-written articles into journalism were discussed."
DELGADOMARTIN2022100281,DEIFDC framework: Evaluation of digital education deployment in India in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic,"the digital education index for developing countries (deifdc) is a compound index that considers nine different variables grouped in three main levers that have been researched relevant to assess the overall state of readiness of digital education deployment in a developing country. digital education has been approached from an instrumental point of view, focusing on the advantages that the introduction at an early stage of digital tools brings to the teaching and learning processes to ensure children can acquire the required 21st competencies of a future workforce. in the application for the indian case, social, cultural, economic and educational data obtained through desk research during the first semester of 2021 has been taken into consideration. despite significant government efforts on scaling up digital education, primarily due to the covid-19 pandemic school closure, the 0.596 deifdc score on a 01 possible range has shown inadequate digital education deployment, derived mainly from poor school infrastructure, limited pedagogical capabilities and modest students skills. furthermore, the socio-demographic differences observed among school children and the existent digital divide in rural and urban areas demonstrate that major effort needs to be undertaken to ensure vulnerable indian population does not lag behind under the new rules of the digital economy."
LOCKWOOD2021100857,Reinforcing key combinatorial ideas in a computational setting: A case of encoding outcomes in computer programming,"counting problems are difficult for students to solve, and there is a perennial need to investigate ways to help students solve counting problems successfully. one promising avenue for students successful counting is for them to think judiciously about how they encode outcomes that is, how they symbolize and represent the outcomes they are trying to count. we provide a detailed case study of two students as they encoded outcomes in their work on several related counting problems within a computational setting. we highlight the role that a computational environment may have played in this encoding activity. we illustrate ways in which by-hand work and computer programming worked together to facilitate the students successful encoding activity. this case demonstrates ways in which the activity of computation seemed to interact with by-hand work to facilitate sophisticated encoding of outcomes."
CHEN2023100184,Integrating generative AI in knowledge building,"generative artificial intelligence (genai) is penetrating in various social sectors, motivating a strong need for teaching ai literacy in younger generations. while substantial efforts have been made to teach ai literacy and to use ai to facilitate learning, few studies have provided empirical accounts of students nuanced processes of using genai for learning. in this study, we engaged a group of high school students in leveraging chatgpt to support their knowledge building efforts. following the teachers pedagogical design, students used chatgpt for a range of distinct purposes. student interviews showed detailed processes of using chatgpt for knowledge building and students emerging ai literacy in multiple dimensions. this study offers practical implications for the integration of genai in k-12 education and urges educators to create spaces and scaffolds for students to mindfully engage with genai in the classroom."
NAKANO2008280,A space–time-ensemble parallel nudged elastic band algorithm for molecular kinetics simulation,"a scalable parallel algorithm has been designed to study long-time dynamics of many-atom systems based on the nudged elastic band method, which performs mutually constrained molecular dynamics simulations for a sequence of atomic configurations (or states) to obtain a minimum energy path between initial and final local minimum-energy states. a directionally heated nudged elastic band method is introduced to search for thermally activated events without the knowledge of final states, which is then applied to an ensemble of bands in a path ensemble method for long-time simulation in the framework of the transition state theory. the resulting molecular kinetics (mk) simulation method is parallelized with a spacetime-ensemble parallel nudged elastic band (step-neb) algorithm, which employs spatial decomposition within each state, while temporal parallelism across the states within each band and band-ensemble parallelism are implemented using a hierarchy of communicator constructs in the message passing interface library. the step-neb algorithm exhibits good scalability with respect to spatial, temporal and ensemble decompositions on massively parallel computers. the mk simulation method is used to study low strain-rate deformation of amorphous silica."
LIU2017300,A simulation and optimization based method for calibrating agent-based emergency department models under data scarcity,"to tackle the problem of efficiently managing increasingly complex systems, simulation models have been widely used. this is because simulation is safer, less expensive, and faster than field implementation and experimenting. to achieve high fidelity and credibility in conducting prediction and exploration of the actual system with simulation models, a rigorous calibration and validation procedure should firstly be applied. however, one of the key issues in calibration is the acquisition of valid source information from the target system. the aim of this study is to develop a systematic method to automatically calibrate a general emergency department model with incomplete data. the simulation-based optimization was used to search for the best value of model parameters. then we present a case study to particularly demonstrate the way to calibrate an agent-based model of an emergency department with real data scarcity. the case study indicates that the proposed method appears to be capable of properly calibrating and validating the simulation model with incomplete data."
ABRAHAM2019101586,Evaluating the effectiveness of learner controlled information security training,"the goal of this study is to examine the effects of learner control on information security (isec) training effectiveness. while organizations recognize the importance of education and training in security and invest in such efforts, the design of these programs often lacks theoretical grounding and the outcomes are often not critically evaluated. this paper attempts to fill these gaps by (1) identifying desirable characteristics for the design of such training programs, (2) using these characteristics as guidelines to design a web-based information security training (3) experimentally evaluating the effectiveness of the training using critical outcomes such as training satisfaction, security training performance, self-efficacy, perceived threat severity and susceptibility. we find that web based isec training that incorporates learner control positively affects training reactions and learning outcomes."
MCCOY201995,Machine learning applications in minerals processing: A review,"machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques have an ever-increasing presence and impact on a wide-variety of research and commercial fields. disappointed by previous hype cycles, researchers and industrial practitioners may be wary of overpromising and underdelivering techniques. this review aims at equipping researchers and industrial practitioners with structured knowledge on the state of machine learning applications in mineral processing: the supplementary material provides a searchable summary of all techniques reviewed, with fields including nature of case study data (syntheticlaboratoryindustrial), level of success, area of application (e.g. milling, flotation, etc), and major problem category (data-based modelling, fault detection and diagnosis, and machine vision). future directions are proposed, including suggestions on data collection, technique comparison, industrial participation, cost-benefit analyses and the future of mineral engineering training."
COURTNEYMUSTAPHI201977,Guidelines for reporting and archiving 210Pb sediment chronologies to improve fidelity and extend data lifecycle,"radiometric dating methods are essential for developing geochronologies to study late quaternary environmental change and 210pb dating is commonly used to produce age-depth models from recent (within 150 years) sediments and other geoarchives. the past two centuries are marked by rapid environmental socio-ecological changes frequently attributed to anthropogenic land-use activities, modified biogeochemical cycles, and climate change. consequently, historical reconstructions over this recent time interval have high societal value because analyses of these datasets provide understanding of the consequences of environmental modifications, critical ecosystem thresholds, and to define desirable ranges of variation for management, restoration, and conservation. for this information to be used more broadly, for example to support land management decisions or to contribute data to regional analyses of ecosystem change, authors must report all of the useful age-depth model information. however, at present there are no guidelines for researchers on what information should be reported to ensure 210pb data are fully disclosed, reproducible, and reusable; leading to a plethora of reporting styles, including inadequate reporting that reduces potential reusability and shortening the data lifecycle. for example, 64 of the publications in a literature review of 210pb dated geoarchives did not include any presentation of age uncertainty estimates in modeled calendar ages used in age-depth models. insufficient reporting of methods and results used in 210pb dating geoarchives severely hampers reproducibility and data reusability, especially in analyses that make use of databased palaeoenvironmental data. reproducibility of data is fundamental to further analyses of the number of palaeoenvironmental data and the spatial coverage of published geoarchives sites. we suggest, and justify, a set of minimum reporting guidelines for metadata and data reporting for 210pb dates, including an ieda (interdisciplinary earth data alliance), lipd (linked paleo data) and generic format data presentation templates, to contribute to improvements in data archiving standards and to facilitate the data requirements of researchers analyzing datasets of several palaeoenvironmental study sites. we analyse practices of methods, results and first order interpretation of 210pb data and make recommendations to authors on effective data reporting and archiving to maximize the value of datasets. we provide empirical evidence from publications and practitioners to support our suggested reporting guidelines. these guidelines increase the scientific value of 210pb by expanding its relevance in the data lifecycle. improving quality and fidelity of environmental datasets broadens interdisciplinary use, lengthens the potential lifecycle of data products, and achieves requirements applicable for evidenced-based policy support."
IIVARI2023100600,Computational empowerment of children: Design research on empowering and impactful designs by children,"prioritizing childrens empowerment in and through design has been on the agenda of childcomputer interaction (cci) research for a long time. recently, the notion of the computational empowerment of children has received attention. however, there are still open issues in our understanding and advocacy of it. a related development is the recent interest in the longer-term impacts of our work. fast and furious participation of children in design sessions is considered inadequate. we should advocate for longer-term trajectories and possibilities for children to make changes that will influence our world. however, the literature is limited in addressing longer-term impacts. this study taps into these two research gaps and showcases how we have addressed the computational empowerment of children in a project tackling bullying at school through critical design and making. in this paper, we examine in detail the childrens designs and their trajectories from the viewpoint of empowerment and impact: whether and how these childrens designs show potential for the empowerment of those bullied and whether and how their designs have had an impact in the realm of digital technology development. our study has interesting conceptual and methodological implications for cci research and practice on the computational empowerment of children and on our design research practice."
PETRI201768,How games for computing education are evaluated? A systematic literature review,"educational games are assumed to be an effective and efficient instructional strategy for computing education. however, it is essential to systematically evaluate such games in order to obtain sound evidence of their impact. thus, the objective of this article is to present the state of the art on how games for computing education are evaluated. therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of a sample of 3617 articles from which 112 relevant articles have been identified, describing 117 studies on the evaluation of games for computing education. based on these studies we analyzed how evaluations are defined (the analysis factors evaluated, research designs, evaluation modelsmethods used, kind of data collection instruments, etc.), how they have been executed (sample size and replications) and analyzed (data analysis methods used). as a result, we can confirm that most evaluations use a simple research design in which, typically, the game is used and afterwards subjective feedback is collected via questionnaires from the learners. the majority of the evaluations are run with small samples, without replication, using mostly qualitative methods for data analysis. we also observed that most studies do not use a well-defined evaluation model or method. this shows that there is a need for more rigorous evaluations as well as methodological support in order to assist game creators and instructors to improve such games as well as to systematically support decisions on when or how to include them within instructional units."
WESTERBERG2021100981,Concurrent predictors of science core knowledge in preschool,"there is little empirical evidence on cross-domain relations with science and other academic domains, which contributes to a limited understanding of the development of early science and how to best support it. the purpose of this study was to examine multiple concurrent predictors of science core knowledge, including executive functioning (ef), vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language in preschool. this study overcomes the limitations of previous work exploring relations between individual predictors, by addressing potentially spurious relations due to acting as proxies for other variables. data were collected from 86 preschool-aged children (36 female) from families with low incomes. findings revealed that when ef, vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language were included in the same model as concurrent predictors of science, only vocabulary significantly predicted childrens science core knowledge. findings from this study have potential implications for the refinement of early science skills and intervention development."
ISMAILOVA2021332,Equalities between Combinators to Evaluate Expressions,"one of the aims of this work is to revise the known issues of how to obtain the value of the expression using an applicative computing system. computation andor symbolic transformations have undoubtedly become one of the dominant trends in modern computer science. in particular, this refers to the execution of the processes of inference of an object with given properties, which is studied with the formation of sets of equalities leading to a target computational model. at the same time, the mathematical theory of computation gets a target equational description, making the process of studying its properties and capabilities more suitable. a model structure based on the method of indexed expressions is developed and applied using the notions of evaluation mapping and assignments. as shown, this may not be considered as generic notion, but derived using the combinators. thus, the semantics of computation can be derived from the construction of a combinator-as-process. this is the embedding into a system of combinators. a linking system of equalities between combinatorsl is established, which serving as a generic computational model. this allows us to look differently at the previous cognitive ideas of the semantics of computation disabling an evaluation map and assignments and enabling their replacement by a set of equalities between combinators."
TISZA2020100184,Patterns in informal and non-formal science learning activities for children–A Europe-wide survey study,"there is a growing number of informal and non-formal learning activities worldwide related to stem (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) curricular subject areasparticularly those involving coding and making. to better understand the general aim and content of such activities, we conducted a survey addressing highly experienced instructional designers and instructors of informal and non-formal science learning activities in nine european countries (n 128). the goal of this paper is to investigate the relation between the gender of the activity leader experts, the target audience, the covered curricular subjects, the main goal, and the place of the activity. the results show that the gender and age of the participants are related to the covered curricular subjects and to the goal of the activity, and that the place of the activity is associated with all of the investigated dimensions. we introduce the patterns we identified that describe typical goals and the covered curricular subjects in relation to the participants gender and age along with patterns between the activity leader experts gender, the covered curricular subjects, and the main goal of the activity, as well as relationships between the studied dimensions and the place of the activity. furthermore, we discuss the best practices and the bottlenecks of the activities, as well as detailed study findings regarding the revealed patterns, in addition to their implications and value for the informal and non-formal learning communities."
LI2020103987,Examining temporal dynamics of self-regulated learning behaviors in STEM learning: A network approach,"from a network perspective, self-regulated learning (srl) can be conceptualized as networks of mutually interacting self-regulatory learning behaviors. nevertheless, the research on how srl behaviors dynamically interact over time in a network architecture is still in its infancy, especially in the context of stem (sciences, technology, engineering, and math) learning. in the present paper, we used a multilevel vector autoregression (var) model to examine the temporal dynamics of srl behaviors as 101 students designed green buildings in energy3d, a simulation-based computer-aided design (cad) environment. we examined how different performance groups (i.e., unsuccessful, success-oriented, and mastery-oriented groups) differed in srl competency, actual srl behaviors, and srl networks. we found that the three groups had no significant difference in their perceived srl competency; however, they differed in srl behaviors of evaluation. both the mastery-oriented and success-oriented groups performed more evaluation behaviors than the unsuccessful group. moreover, the mastery-oriented group showed stronger interaction between srl behaviors than the success-oriented group and the unsuccessful group. the srl networks of the three groups shared some similarities, but they were different from each other in general. this study has significant theoretical and methodological implications for the advancement of research in srl dynamics."
GIANNAKOS201827,From players to makers: An empirical examination of factors that affect creative game development,"the recent incremental growth of tangible and programming technologies has made it possible for teenagers to engage in creative game development activities. the aim of this work is to increase knowledge on the factors that characterize these activities and to increase understanding about what motivates young students to participate in such activities. in our empirical evaluation, a group of researchers and artists designed, implemented and evaluated workshop programs with 78 students aged 12 and 17 years. for the first study, we collected qualitative data from 11 interviews and subjected this data content analysis. for the second study, we designed a survey grounded in motivational factors for technology and collected 49 responses. the results show that (a) creative development activities raise awareness of technology (especially in female students), intensify the experience and invite students to explore boundaries, increase collaboration and exchange views and ideas, and (b) participants effort expectancy and performance expectancy significantly affect their intention to participate."
PAL2020105535,Perceived usability evaluation of Microsoft Teams as an online learning platform during COVID-19 using system usability scale and technology acceptance model in India,"the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a physical shutdown of all types of educational institutes worldwide due to which the education delivery has now shifted to an online only exclusivity model. in this perspective, perceived usability of the online learning platforms that are currently being used is an important aspect, especially due to the absence of any physical classes. in this work microsoft teams is used as the reference platform for which the perceived usability is evaluated. for the evaluation purpose a dual strategy is followed by using the system usability scale (sus), which is a human computer interaction (hci) based approach, and the technology acceptance model (tam), which is an information systems (is) based approach. although both these instruments are popular in their respective domains, yet they have not been considered simultaneously in one work for the purpose of usability evaluation. by doing so, this work attempts to streamline and unify the process of usability evaluation. results that are obtained from a large-scale survey of university students show the similarity and equivalency between the two methodologies, with the perceived ease of use (peou) construct of tam having greater similarity with sus. moreover, this work also considers the digital-divide aspect (mobile vs. web environment) that is prevalent particularly in developing countries like india, and whether it has any effect on the perceived usability. results show that the consumption platform does not have any effect on the usability aspect."
ALFOUDARI2021104282,Understanding socio-technological challenges of smart classrooms using a systematic review,"smart classrooms are paradigm innovations for enhanced learning behavior in digital learning environments. these environments offer benefits for inclusive and virtual learning, underscoring the need for assessments of current practices. although research on smart classrooms propose models and systems for enhancing socio-technological integration, knowledge on socio-technological challenges of smart classrooms remains limited. this article applies a systematic review methodology in line with the prisma protocol and analyzes current social and technological challenges based on 105 articles published between 2000 and 2019. the review identifies social challenges that facilitate personalization for external factors and teaching methods, stimulate learner-oriented content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement, and boost interactivity depending on the willingness of learners and instructors. the review also finds technological challenges that concern designing learning environments and integrating intelligent systems, analytical tools and analysis, system models and ontology, and mobile and social media applications. the review suggests areas for future research involving smart classroom design for continuity and consistency, quality attributes of smart classrooms, efficiency and sustainability of smart classroom infrastructure, and the development of a smart classroom modelling language."

ULFERTBLANK2022104626,Assessing digital self-efficacy: Review and scale development,"today, digitalization is affecting all areas of life, such as education or work. the competent use of digital systems (esp. information and communication technologies ict) has thus become an essential skill. despite longstanding research on human-technology interaction and diverse theoretical approaches describing competences for interacting with digital systems, research still offers mixed results regarding the structure of digital competences. self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness. the present study aims at providing a systematic overview and comparison of existing measures of digital self-efficacy (dse) to current theoretical digital competence frameworks. further, we present a newly developed scale that assesses digital self-efficacy in heterogeneous adult populations, theoretically founded in the digcomp 2.1 and social-cognition theory. the factorial structure of the dse scale is assessed to investigate multidimensionality. further, the scale is validated considering the nomological network (actual ict use, technophobia). implications for research and practice are discussed."
DAVID2024105502,Understanding local government responsible AI strategy: An international municipal policy document analysis,"the burgeoning capabilities of artificial intelligence (ai) have prompted numerous local governments worldwide to consider its integration into their operations. nevertheless, instances of notable ai failures have heightened ethical concerns, emphasising the imperative for local governments to approach the adoption of ai technologies in a responsible manner. while local government ai guidelines endeavour to incorporate characteristics of responsible innovation and technology (rit), it remains essential to assess the extent to which these characteristics have been integrated into policy guidelines to facilitate more effective ai governance in the future. this study closely examines local government policy documents (n 26) through the lens of rit, employing directed content analysis with thematic data analysis software. the results reveal that: (a) not all rit characteristics have been given equal consideration in these policy documents; (b) participatory and deliberate considerations were the most frequently mentioned responsible ai characteristics in policy documents; (c) adaptable, explainable, sustainable, and accountable considerations were the least present responsible ai characteristics in policy documents; (d) many of the considerations overlapped with each other as local governments were at the early stages of identifying them. furthermore, the paper summarised strategies aimed at assisting local authorities in identifying their strengths and weaknesses in responsible ai characteristics, thereby facilitating their transformation into governing entities with responsible ai practices. the study informs local government policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on the critical aspects of responsible ai policymaking."
JIANG2022102058,How do mathematics interest and self-efficacy influence coding interest and self-efficacy? A structural equation modeling analysis,"coding is a highly valued skill used in many disciplines across the globe. however, it is reported that students coding interest and self-efficacy are usually low. theoretically, the affective domain of coding is in its infancy, and very few studies have set out to identify the determinants of coding interest and self-efficacy. this study explored how mathematics interest and self-efficacy, as two important mathematics-related factors, influenced coding interest and self-efficacy. employing a quantitative cross-sectional survey design, 605 students from two public senior high schools in two big cities in china were investigated. a two-step structural equation modeling approach was adopted to analyze the data. findings showed that mathematics interest, directly and indirectly, influenced coding interest significantly. in addition, coding self-efficacy was indirectly impacted by mathematics interest and coding interest was indirectly impacted by mathematics self-efficacy significantly. most importantly, our model has proved to be powerful in explaining coding interest. this study contributes to the theoretical and practical understanding of the relationship between mathematics and coding attitudes, seldom explored in senior high school settings."
ZHANG20232061,Exploring the Latest Applications of OpenAI and ChatGPT: An In-Depth Survey,"openai and chatgpt, as state-of-the-art language models driven by cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, have gained widespread adoption across diverse industries. in the realm of computer vision, these models have been employed for intricate tasks including object recognition, image generation, and image processing, leveraging their advanced capabilities to fuel transformative breakthroughs. within the gaming industry, they have found utility in crafting virtual characters and generating plots and dialogues, thereby enabling immersive and interactive player experiences. furthermore, these models have been harnessed in the realm of medical diagnosis, providing invaluable insights and support to healthcare professionals in the realm of disease detection. the principal objective of this paper is to offer a comprehensive overview of openai, openai gym, chatgpt, dall e, stable diffusion, the pre-trained clip model, and other pertinent models in various domains, encompassing clip text-to-image, education, medical imaging, computer vision, social influence, natural language processing, software development, coding assistance, and chatbot, among others. particular emphasis will be placed on comparative analysis and examination of popular text-to-image and text-to-video models under diverse stimuli, shedding light on the current research landscape, emerging trends, and existing challenges within the domains of openai and chatgpt. through a rigorous literature review, this paper aims to deliver a professional and insightful overview of the advancements, potentials, and limitations of these pioneering language models."
HELBING2023102061,"Democracy by Design: Perspectives for Digitally Assisted, Participatory Upgrades of Society","the technological revolution, particularly the availability of more data and more powerful computational tools, has led to the emergence of a new scientific field called computational diplomacy. our work tries to define its scope and focuses on a popular subarea of it, namely digital democracy. in recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using digital technologies to promote more participatory forms of democracy. while there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. it is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. this paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies. we argue that more research on how digital technologies can be used to support democracy upgrade is needed. along these lines, we lay out a research agenda for the future."
LIANG2023104827,A robot-based digital storytelling approach to enhancing EFL learners’ multimodal storytelling ability and narrative engagement,"digital technology has brought new opportunities for language education. multimodal literacy refers to the ability to read, watch, understand, respond to, and generate multimodal texts. multimodality, promoted by scholars, generates meaning in multiple modes. hence, digital storytelling (dst) presented with multimodal content has been extensively applied in second language instruction. however, traditional dst is mostly presented in videos with one-way communication; it lacks two-way communication with the audience and is only regarded as a learning method for knowledge acquisition. as a result, the present study proposed a robot-based dst (robot-dst) approach to facilitate the interaction in the dst process and to enhance students engagement. in order to evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an efl course at a senior high school. two classes of 11th graders participated in the experiment. one class with 40 students was the experimental group adopting the robot-dst approach, while the other class with 40 students was the control group adopting the conventional animation-based dst (ca-dst) approach. the results showed that the robot-dst approach could significantly reduce students communication apprehension, as well as enhance their english speaking ability, storytelling ability, narrative engagement, and communication tendency. the findings show that using robots in the context of digital storytelling design has great potential for promoting learners language learning performances. accordingly, in-depth discussion and suggestions for future research are provided for researchers and school teachers who intend to use robots in educational settings."
SOSAREYES2022676,"Interdisciplinary approaches to the teaching of forensic science in the Forensic Science Undergraduate Program of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, before and after COVID-19","in 2013, the forensic science undergraduate program (fsup) at the national autonomous university of mexico was created in response to an alarming criminal situation in mexico, as well as to the radical reform of its criminal justice system. its mission is to educate and train ethical, critical, and humanistic forensic scientists capable of conducting inquiries that meet scientific quality standards and assist the justice system in firmly linking legal rulings to the available evidence. at the time, it was the first such program in the country, and the contributions that interdisciplinary forensic scientists could make to criminal investigations were largely unknown among forensic and legal practitioners. during its existence, providing an interdisciplinary, competence-based education to students has been one of the main challenges. to overcome it, teaching and assessment approachescentered on the achievement of specifically forensic competencies as learning outcomes and the integration of forensic disciplines towards the resolution of simulated caseshave been devised to help develop the professional skill set expected of graduates. the covid-19 pandemic led to adapting these approaches to distance or hybrid modes of learning, increasing their versatility and enriching the pedagogic repertoire of the fsup. currently, the main impact of the program lies in the successful incorporation of some of its graduates to agencies belonging to or related to the criminal justice system, such as the national prosecutors office, the commission for truth and justice for the ayotzinapa case, and the national commission for the search of missing and disappeared persons, among others."
FLYNN2021100325,A narrative review of methods used to examine digital gaming impacts on learning and cognition during middle childhood,"middle childhood remains a privileged albeit understudied developmental period in studies examining childcomputer interactions, particularly as it pertains to digital game play. middle childhood also is marked by increasing digital game play, arguably the most common form of childcomputer interactions during this developmental period. for example, children between the ages of 6 and 8 play digital games 6090 min per day and 47 of 3rd to 8th grade teachers reported using digital games in their classrooms several times a week (vega robb, 2019). surprisingly, how content learning and cognition may be facilitated through digital gaming remains sparsely investigated among children during this period. in the studies that do examine the linkages between game play and content learning or cognition, research methodologies vary markedly. the goal of this narrative review is to help bring greater cohesion to the research literature, which often spans many disciplines. this review emphasizes the games, measurement of outcomes, and research designs that have been used to examine content learning and cognitive skills among children ages 6 to 12 in the context of digital games."
CHEN2021100379,Conceptualization and measurement of digital citizenship across disciplines,"a corollary to the exponential growth of digital technology is the increase in research interest in the construct of digital citizenship (dc) in diverse disciplinary areas. although the term dc is used widely in research, scholars do not commit to a common definition. this integrative review investigates the conceptualizations and measurements of dc, across disciplines, in the extant literature. a systematic search of 11 databases identified a total of 350 unique items that contain digital citizenship in the title or keywords published by december 2018, with the majority published after 2010. of these, 114 were peer-reviewed journal articles published in a wide range of discipline-specific venues, more than half of which were education-related. in-depth analyses show that each of the dominant conceptualizations of dc has been adopted by different disciplines, albeit with different popularities in adoption. findings also revealed widely shared stakeholder concerns and research foci in dc research across the disciplines. however, there is a stark lack of empirical research on the young children, and an absence of commonly deployed research instruments in dc-related research. the present integrative review implicates the need for interdisciplinary collaboration for significant advances in dc research to address issues in policy and practice."
CHANG2022104641,Ten years of augmented reality in education: A meta-analysis of (quasi-) experimental studies to investigate the impact,"augmented reality (ar) continues to show its impact in education. while systematic review and meta-analysis studies have synthesized the evidence of this impact, most of them did not differentiate how ar may foster various learning outcomes to different degrees. in this study, 134 (quasi-)experimental studies on augmented reality (ar) in education from 2012 to 2021 were reviewed to discern the impact of ar on three levels of learning outcomes, namely response, knowledge and skill, and performance. the 134 studies are the data of this study for meta-analysis, which were obtained following the procedure of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. moreover, meta-regression was employed to investigate important factors relating to the variation of the impact, including educational level, subject area, treatment duration, and ar affordance. findings from the meta-analysis suggest that ar technology has benefited all three learning outcomes, with a larger mean effect size on the outcome of performance. furthermore, the meta-regression results indicate treatment duration as a significant factor likely relating to the variation in the impact of ar in education. moreover, ar used to support the learning of languages or social studies is likely associated with higher positive learner responses such as learning motivation or attitude than ar used for science learning. the meta-regression result indicated that use of 3-d visualization in ar needs to be carefully designed and evaluated. the implications of using ar to support learning, the design of ar learning environments, and the future direction of research are discussed."

FREDJ2015206,Abstracting Anonymization Techniques: A Prerequisite for Selecting a Generalization Algorithm,"the recent buzz around open data highlighted the crucial problem of anonymization in the context of data publishing. many research efforts were devoted to the definition of techniques performing such an anonymization. however the selection of the most relevant technique and the adequate algorithm is complex. successful decision depends firstly on the ability of data publishers to understand the anonymization techniques and their associated algorithms. in this paper, we focus on the choice of an algorithm among the different ones implementing one of the anonymization techniques, namely generalization. through an abstraction process presented in this paper, we provide data publishers with simplified descriptions for the generalization technique and its algorithms. these descriptions facilitate the understanding of the algorithms by data publishers having low programing skills. we present also some other use cases of these abstractions as well as an experimentation conducted to validate them."
ZARESTKY2022100085,Reflective Writing Supports Metacognition and Self-regulation in Graduate Computational Science and Engineering,"computational science and engineering (cse) is a relatively new discipline for which no consensus exists on how classes should best be taught. many cse courses are compressed add-ons to existing programs and, consequently, must cover a breadth of topics encompassing modules from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and application disciplines. additionally, these courses would benefit from embedded 21st century skills, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and lifelong learning behaviors, but such skills are often neglected in course design even though the education and workforce literature are clear about their importance for future careers. the breadth and complexity in course design necessary to incorporate all of these components create a challenge for instructors and students. in this interpretive study, we investigate student experiences and perceived outcomes in a technology-mediated graduate-level cse course designed to address the difficulties associated with this wide range of disciplinary topics and professional skills. our course design is based on reflective practice and principles of metacognition, and applies elements such as a flipped classroom, student journals, and reflective writing exercises; these design goals directly support students metacognition and foster self-regulated learning behaviors that, in turn, develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. we evaluate this design using student reflective writing and surveys. results indicate reflective writing activities in course design helped develop students metacognitive awareness, self-regulated learning behaviors, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. this course design can serve as a template for others teaching technology-mediated courses in cse and related areas, and aiming to develop students 21st century professional skills."

ZITO2021100222,Leveraging tangible interfaces in primary school math: Pilot testing of the Owlet math program,"this paper presents pilot testing of owlet, a math program based on two original, tangible interface devices for primary school math and their accompanying apps. we built on prior work that demonstrated promising outcomes regarding manipulatives in math education and tangible user interfaces in a variety of applications. the owlet program was pilot tested in ten classrooms, spanning students ages 5 to 11. we found that teachers used the exploratory activities to introduce the program, and other activities to encourage differentiated, student-paced practice of math concepts. students were interested and engaged in using owlet during the pilot tests, leading to student driven generation of challenges. through development, owlet, as a whole program, spanned more math concepts by prioritizing flexibility in one tangible interface and concreteness in the other. our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each tangible device."
ANTLE2022100374,Research in Child–Computer Interaction: Provocations and envisioning future directions,"in the 21st century the academic field of childcomputer interaction (cci) arose alongside burgeoning interactive technology and digital media industries that targeted children. we believe that the field of cciu is at an important point in its development, analogous to when a child becomes a teen. over the last few years we have each had many informal conversations with other cci researchers in which we discuss issues such as, what is our responsibility as researchers beyond academe what values underlie our conceptions of a good childhood and the role of interactive technology in it and, how do we ensure that our field continues to grow and evolve in ways that are consistent with our responsibilities and values to address these and other complex questions that have been drawing our attention we came together to reflect, discuss and create a position paper for our community, in which we outline some of the issues we see facing our community at this time. to inform our deliberations with opinions beyond our own we conducted an informal consultation with 25 members of the cci community. our responders spanned junior to senior researchers, represented diverse geographies and included industry practitioners. these diverse responses provided further content for our reflections, and helped us see perspectives beyond our own. the result of this informal process is this speculative paper in which we propose a series of seven provocations that aim to disrupt some of the normative assumptions held in our field. our goal in doing this is to open up dialogue in our community about these issues and promote consideration of the alternative visions we present for where we might focus our attention and efforts. we see our contribution not as truth or a definitive statement of a vision for the field, but rather as our opinion about some of the complex issues we face and that we think should be considered through dialogue as we move into the next phase of our development as an academic and scholarly community. we believe that it is urgent and critical for our field that we take up these questions, explore diverse perspectives, and critically work towards decisions and actions that will define our identity and the value of our contributions as we move forward into the next 20 years of research in cci."
LEPRI2021102249,Ethical machines: The human-centric use of artificial intelligence,"summary todays increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artificial intelligence (ai) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be influenced by prejudice, conflicts of interest, or fatigue. however, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. in this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric ai: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. we also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy."
LIU20171,A remix-oriented approach to promoting student engagement in a long-term participatory learning program,"researchers and educators continuously remark on the importance of integrating creativity into the learning process. this study proposes a creativity approach to facilitating participatory learning for the sustained engagement of young learners based on the principle of remix practice, which consists of learning to generate online artefacts, endless hybridization and scaffolding. this study investigated students engagement in and perceptions of the creative learning process during a two-year participatory learning program. data collected included students flow perceptions during a 39-week activity, their motivation and creative self-efficacy before and after the intervention, as well as their creative products. the findings indicated that the remix-oriented approach led to a higher level of intrinsic motivation and sustained flow compared to a model-based approach, especially interest and curiosity, in this participatory learning program. the approach also helped the students to perceive a significant increase in their level of creative self-efficacy associated with strategies to generate creative ideas. the results of this study suggest that the principle of remix practice is helpful for leveraging knowledge acquisition and the creative nature of participatory learning activities to sustain student engagement in participatory learning programs."
NEWHALL201753,Pervasive parallel and distributed computing in a liberal arts college curriculum,"we present a model for incorporating parallel and distributed computing (pdc) throughout an undergraduate cs curriculum. our curriculum is designed to introduce students early to parallel and distributed computing topics and to expose students to these topics repeatedly in the context of a wide variety of cs courses. the key to our approach is the development of a required intermediate-level course that serves as an introduction to computer systems and parallel computing. it serves as a requirement for every cs major and minor and is a prerequisite to upper-level courses that expand on parallel and distributed computing topics in different contexts. with the addition of this new course, we are able to easily make room in upper-level courses to add and expand parallel and distributed computing topics. the goal of our curricular design is to ensure that every graduating cs major has exposure to parallel and distributed computing, with both a breadth and depth of coverage. our curriculum is particularly designed for the constraints of a small liberal arts college, however, much of its ideas and its design are applicable to any undergraduate cs curriculum."
PDELOPE2021100429,A novel UML-based methodology for modeling adventure-based educational games,"in the last years, serious games have been successfully exploited in different areas. however, in spite of the powerful tool that this kind of video games has proved to be in the classroom, a few methodological efforts have been conducted in order to involve pedagogues or educators in the design loop of these games or, one step further, include students in the co-design process to promote learning through design as a context. with this objective, this paper presents a set of metamodels that could facilitate the conceptual design of this type of games. to this end, a complete graphical notation based on the uml standard (with adaptations) is defined for representing the components of this type of games; having in mind to improve the collaboration between the team of educatorsstudents and the technical team during the design process. finally, the design diagrams defined during the production of a specific serious game, titled uranus, are illustrated, in order to show the feasibility of the proposal. in addition, a validation experience was conducted with educators and computer engineering students in order to test the value of the proposed graphic notation to design educational games."
RADIANTI2020103778,"A systematic review of immersive virtual reality applications for higher education: Design elements, lessons learned, and research agenda","researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (vr) in different scenarios. vr possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. however, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive vr for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (hmds). hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of vr in higher education. the reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the vr design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful vr-based learning. the mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of vr in the higher education spherefor instance, learning theories were not often considered in vr application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. furthermore, the evaluation of educational vr applications has primarily focused on usability of the vr apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive vr has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. nevertheless, vr seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. the identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of vr design for education, which could motivate future work in the field."
GONCHAROW2021316,CS-Materials: A system for classifying and analyzing pedagogical materials to improve adoption of parallel and distributed computing topics in early CS courses,"the nsfieee-tcpp parallel and distributed computing curriculum guidelines released in 2012 (pdc12) represents an effort to bring more parallel computing concepts into early computer science courses. to date, it has been moderately successful, with the inclusion of some pdc topics in the acmieee computer science curriculum guidelines in 2013 (cs13) and mentions of pdc topics in the computing curricula 2020. additionally, some universities in the u.s. and around the world have started to cover some of these topics in early cs courses. lack of knowledge of or training in pdc topics among instructors, along with the need to align early cs course content with prescribed learning objectives in the curricula, are often cited as hurdles for adoption in early cs courses. there have been attempts at bringing pdc materials, such as textbook chapters, lecture slides, assignments, and demos to assist instructors of early cs classes. however, the effort required on the part of the instructor to figure out what is relevant to a particular class can be daunting. in this work, we contend that simultaneously classifying pedagogical materials against the cs13 and the pdc12 curriculum guidelines can address some of the challenges faced by instructors and can promote broader adoption of pdc materials in early cs courses. we present cs materials, a system that can be used to categorize pedagogical materials according to well-known and established curricular guidelines. we show that cs materials can be leveraged 1) by instructors of early cs courses to find materials that are similar to the one that they use but that also cover pdc topics, and 2) by instructors to check the coverage of topics (and gaps) in a course, and 3) by pdc experts to identify topics for which pdc instructional materials do not exist or are insufficient in order to inform development of additional pdc curricular materials."

CRUJEIRAS2013208,Challenges in the implementation of a competency-based curriculum in Spain,"this paper addresses some of the challenges involved in implementing the new approach established in the spanish national curriculum in 2006, which brought as a major change a focus on the development of key competencies. the paper focuses on scientific competency and the challenges involved in the itinerary from policy documents to classrooms are addressed in three sections: (i) an analysis is made of the changes in the science curriculum as a consequence of the emphasis on scientific competency, comparing the assessment criteria in the previous and current steering documents; (ii) trends in teacher education are discussed; (iii) the findings of the diagnostic evaluation are analyzed. the paper is framed in a theoretical approach, viewing students participation in scientific practices, and the development of higher-order thinking as necessary goals of science education. we argue that the focus on competencies, characterized as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new contexts, involves a major change towards knowledge transfer and higher-order thinking skills. some issues emerging from the analysis relate to the implications of assessment criteria and the challenges involved in its implementation, to the trends in teacher professional development and the difficulties related to the current economic crisis and to the results of the diagnostic evaluation and time frame needed for reforms to have an impact. it is argued that the development of both competencies and higher-order thinking requires students prolonged engagement."
RAMNARAIN201465,"Teachers' perceptions of inquiry-based learning in urban, suburban, township and rural high schools: The context-specificity of science curriculum implementation in South Africa","this study investigated the perceptions of physical sciences (physics and chemistry) teachers on the implementation of inquiry-based learning at a diversity of high schools in south africa. the findings show that teachers at all locations of school have a positive perception of inquiry-based learning, with benefits for learners that include the development of experimental skills and making science more enjoyable. however, with regard to inquiry facilitating conceptual understanding, teachers at township and rural schools believe a didactic approach to be more effective than learners doing inquiry, whilst teachers at suburban and urban schools favour an inquiry-based approach in this regard. the significance of this study is that the lack of resources, large classes, and the limited exposure to inquiry of learners at township and rural schools constrain the implementation of inquiry-based learning at these schools, and result in teachers at such schools resorting to a didactic pedagogy."
SAILER2024108305,The End is the Beginning is the End: The closed-loop learning analytics framework,"this article provides a comprehensive review of current practices and methodologies within the field of learning analytics, structured around a dedicated closed-loop framework. this framework effectively integrates various aspects of learning analytics into a cohesive framework, emphasizing the interplay between data collection, processing and analysis, as well as adaptivity and personalization, all connected by the learners involved and underpinned by educational and psychological theory. in reviewing each step of the closed loop, the article delves into the advancements in data collection, exploring how technological progress has expanded data collection methods, particularly focusing on the potential of multimodal data acquisition and how theory can inform this step. the processing and analysis step is thoroughly reviewed, highlighting a range of methods including machine learning and ai, and discussing the critical balance between prediction accuracy and interpretability. the adaptivity and personalization step examines the current state of research, underscoring significant gaps and the necessity for theory-informed, personalized learning interventions. overall, the article underscores the importance of interdisciplinarity in learning analytics, advocating for the integration of insights from various fields to address challenges such as ethical data usage and the creation of quality learning experiences. this framework and review aim to guide future research and practice in learning analytics, promoting the development of effective, learner-centric educational environments driven by balancing data-driven insights and theoretical understanding."
WALSH2017228,A co-creativity theoretical framework to foster and evaluate the presence of wise humanising creativity in virtual learning environments (VLEs),"wise humanising creativity (whc) is creativity guided by ethical action, meaning it is mindful of its consequences and is empowering, offering far greater shared hope for the future than the competitive mentality that pervades most education systems. understanding how virtual learning environments (vles) can foster whc is becoming exceedingly important because it problematizes the marketisation of childhood and youth. it also offers new ways of considering educational futures including implications for the theoretical understanding of creativity within vles. we report on the theoretical development of the concept of whc within c2learn, a three-year project designing a digital gaming environment that provides children and young people with multiple opportunities to engage in co-creativity to foster their whc. c2learn is the first time whc has actively been conceptualised in a digital context. we present our over-arching co-creativity conceptual framework which has been developed to frame the specific kind of co-creativity that is envisaged within c2learns vle. drawing on that framework, we present a co-creativity assessment methodology specifically focused on evaluating the presence of whc. we argue that leveraging whc within vles broadens perspectives on the purposes of education, as this ethically framed creativity foregrounds the role of values in generating fundamental small-scale creative change through journeys of becoming that have the potential to generate quiet revolutions or small cumulative, incremental changes over time which are meaningful to a particular community."
HULSEN202169,Chapter 4 - Challenges and solutions for big data in personalized healthcare,"big data is a term that has been used often in the past decade to describe datasets that are extremely large and complex so that traditional software is unable to store and analyze them in an accurate way. it can refer to long data, wide data, and both. big data is of increasing importance in healthcare as well: new methods dedicated to improving data collection, storage, cleaning, processing, and interpretation for medical research continue to be developed. exploiting new tools and methods to extract meaning from large volume information has the potential to drive real change in clinical practice, and combining this novel data-driven research with the classical hypothesis-driven research will have a large impact on personalized healthcare. however, significant challenges remain. here we discuss the challenges (and possible solutions) posed to biomedical research by our increasing ability to collect, store, and analyze large datasets. important challenges include: (1) the need for standardization of data content, format, and clinical definitions, adhering to the fair guiding principles; (2) the need for collaborative networks with sharing of both data and expertise, for example through a federated approach; (3) stricter privacy and ethics regulations, in particular the gdpr in the european union; and (4) a need to reconsider how and when analytic methodology (data science) is taught to medical researchers. overcoming these challenges will help to make a success of the use of big data in medical and translational research."
ERNSTSLAVIT20171,Teacher questions: Learning the discourse of science in a linguistically diverse elementary classroom,using ethnographic and sociolinguistic perspectives the authors examined the quality and quantity of questions asked by one teacher in a diverse fourth grade classroom with a large number of emergent bilinguals and low-income students during a six-week science unit in a school located in the pacific northwest of the united states. this study illustrates how teacher questions played a pivotal role in facilitating students access to both the content and the genre specific language of science.
KNIGHT2020100729,Implementing learning analytics for learning impact: Taking tools to task,"learning analytics has the potential to impact student learning, at scale. embedded in that claim are a set of assumptions and tensions around the nature of scale, impact on student learning, and the scope of infrastructure encompassed by learning analytics as a socio-technical field. drawing on our design experience of developing learning analytics and inducting others into its use, we present a model that we have used to address five key challenges we have encountered. in developing this model, we recommend: a focus on impact on learning through augmentation of existing practice; the centrality of tasks in implementing learning analytics for impact on learning; the commensurate centrality of learning in evaluating learning analytics; inclusion of co-design approaches in implementing learning analytics across sites; and an attention to both social and technical infrastructure."
ZHANG2023108553,"Structural renovation of blocks in build-up area of Jiangnan cities, taking Suzhou new district as an example","summary the rationality of block scale and structure is the guarantee of vitality and humanization quality, facing complex and diverse problems, and the structure reconstruction of urban built-up areas is one of the most difficult challenges in the process of promoting the block system. the traditional planning-construction strategy, as practice in recent years has demonstrated, faces challenges in terms of construction costs, demolition costs, property rights, and jurisprudence. based on the interaction of the block structure and external space, the study presents a implant-reconstruction model. it investigates possibilities of implanting elements and graphically depicts the potential impact of implant-reconstruction using space syntax. the findings indicate that the external space implantation mode may actively encourage the construction of small-scale blocks and has benefits in terms of texture respect, low impact, and ease of operation. the simulation and pre-judgment dynamically illustrate the viable path and gives a scientific reference for block alteration."
LAURIE2022100384,The role of robotic toys in shaping play and joint engagement in autistic children: Implications for future design,"autistic children are thought to develop social attention skills differently from non-autistic children. previous work has shown that technology, and specifically tangible toys, could have the potential to support social attention in autistic children. a key challenge is knowing how to design and use interactive and intelligent technologies to support interaction in autistic children, given the heterogeneity in levels of social motivation, social development, and interest in digital technologies. to address this challenge, we examined in detail the interaction between digital features and autistic childrens joint engagement in a real-world setting, exploring the impact of tangible constraints in fostering social interaction. the current study observed autistic children (aged between 12 and 15 years) playing with a digital robotic toy and a non-digital counterpart, and measured social attention and engagement during free play. the results showed that increased and higher levels of joint attention when children had to share a toy between them, on both digital and non-digital interfaces. we found that autistic children individually vary in their propensity to engage in social interactions, as well as their responses to digital features. this work contributes to a growing area of evidence that tangible and smart technologies can create social opportunities for autistic children."
DESORDI2022100659,"Dark, down, and destructive side of entrepreneurship: Unveiling negative aspects of unsuccessful entrepreneurial action","studies associated with critical analyses of entrepreneurship education (ee) highlight the predominance of literatures that focus closely on the positive aspects of entrepreneurship. this can lead to cognitive bias, resulting in students developing more favorable and even enthusiastic perceptions of entrepreneurial action. to reduce this information asymmetry, the intention of this study was to identify and classify the diversity of negative aspects resulting from unsuccessful entrepreneurial action. to this end, we applied the content analysis technique to the transcripts of interviews with former entrepreneurs and stakeholders associated with entrepreneurial action, in addition to the texts of articles from important journals of entrepreneurship and small business identified through a scope literature review. the findings indicate that unsuccessful entrepreneurial action can result in several negative effects for the entrepreneur, both subjectively (psychological and social aspects - dark side) and objectively (material aspects - downside). the study also identified several negative effects that impact other individuals and society (destructive side). the literature review and interaction with former entrepreneurs and professionals who work with entrepreneurs showed 38 negative aspects in the three dimensions known as triple ds (dark, destructive and downside). a taxonomy tree was developed that integrates these different types and subtypes, as well as software (https:thetripleds.com) that makes these contents available. these resources can be used by ee professors, managers and technicians of agencies that support entrepreneurs to raise the awareness of potential entrepreneurs regarding the various risks associated with entrepreneurial action."

GURBAN2016186,Global trends in education: Russia case study,"an improved system of russian vocational education is seen as a major factor in the countrys economic development. it is currently recognized that the global labour market is emerging as a consequence of globalization processes, which significantly affect the establishment of national educational systems. the paper discusses global educational trends, with a particular focus on the tendencies in the demand for labour both in russia and in the world. the paper aims to describe changes in attitudes towards the relevance of specialist qualifications and the sufficiency of professional competencies acquired through education. in addition, the analysis of structural changes in the russian system of vocational education starting from 1990 to the present day is given. the research is carried out using the methods of comparative and statistical analysis. the competency maps of future are drawn (institute for the future, palo alto, the usa), including the description of trends that alter the habitual context for the labour force, as well as key skills needed for a successful career. the atlas of new professions describing most promising professions in the field of education is reviewed. it is shown that the countrys role in the international division of labour can be used as an objective criterion to assess the performance of the countrys educational system. in this respect, the data on russias position in the world rankings of competitiveness, innovation development and human development index, as well as the comparative data on the rate that russian companies demonstrate in terms of innovative activity and technology exports are provided. the analysis of disproportions in the structure of graduates both in terms of levels and specialities of vocational education for the period 19902013 is given. key problems faced by the russian vocational education system are considered, including a weak focus on the actual needs of national economy and global changes in the labour market, a decline in the quality of training and the number of working specialities, as well as the low flexibility of educational programs."
DUTTAMOSCATO201412,"Creating a pipeline of talent for informatics: STEM initiative for high school students in computer science, biology, and biomedical informatics","this editorial provides insights into how informatics can attract highly trained students by involving them in science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) training at the high school level and continuing to provide mentorship and research opportunities through the formative years of their education. our central premise is that the trajectory necessary to be expert in the emergent fields in front of them requires acceleration at an early time point. both pathology (and biomedical) informatics are new disciplines which would benefit from involvement by students at an early stage of their education. in 2009, michael t lotze md, kirsten livesey (then a medical student, now a medical resident at university of pittsburgh medical center (upmc)), richard hersheberger, phd (currently, dean at roswell park), and megan seippel, ms (the administrator) launched the university of pittsburgh cancer institute (upci) summer academy to bring high school students for an 8 week summer academy focused on cancer biology. initially, pathology and biomedical informatics were involved only in the classroom component of the upci summer academy. in 2011, due to popular interest, an informatics track called computer science, biology and biomedical informatics (cosbbi) was launched. cosbbi currently acts as a feeder program for the undergraduate degree program in bioinformatics at the university of pittsburgh, which is a joint degree offered by the departments of biology and computer science. we believe training in bioinformatics is the best foundation for students interested in future careers in pathology informatics or biomedical informatics. we describe our approach to the recruitment, training and research mentoring of high school students to create a pipeline of exceptionally well-trained applicants for both the disciplines of pathology informatics and biomedical informatics. we emphasize here how mentoring of high school students in pathology informatics and biomedical informatics will be critical to assuring their success as leaders in the era of big data and personalized medicine."
SHAH2023100040,The influences of computer gameplay and social media use on computer science identity and computer science career interests,"computer gameplay and social media are the two most common forms of entertainment in the digital age. many scholars share the assumption that leisure-time digital consumption is associated with computer science (cs) affinity, but there is a dearth of research evidence for this relationship. female students generally spend less time on gaming and more time on social media than do male students, so a gender comparison perspective is helpful. using multinomial logistic regression analysis on a national sample of 10,197 u.s. college students in introductory cs courses, we found that frequent computer gameplay was strongly associated with an increase in the probability of cs career interest relative to a non-stem career interest ( -0.17, se 0.06, p .01) for both male (n 7214) and female students (n 2659). in contrast, increased social media use predicted a higher cs career interest relative to a scienceengineering career interest ( 0.12, se 0.06, p .05) for female students by 8, however, a lower interest for male students by 4."
VELDHUIS2025100708,Critical Artificial Intelligence literacy: A scoping review and framework synthesis,"the proliferation of artificial intelligence (ai) in everyday life raises concerns for children, other marginalized groups, and the general public. as new ai implementations continue to emerge, it is crucial to enable children to engage critically with ai. critical literacy objectives and practices can encourage children to question, critique, and transform the social, political, cultural, and ethical implications of ai. as an initial step towards critical ai education, we conducted a 10-year scoping review to identify publications reporting on activities that engage children, between the ages of 5 and 18, to address the critical implications of ai. our review identifies a wide range of participants, content, and pedagogical approaches. through framework synthesis guided by an established critical literacy model, we examine the critical literacy learning objectives embedded in the reported activities and propose a critical ai literacy framework. this paper outlines future opportunities for critical ai literacies in the field of childcomputer interaction including inspiring new learning activities, encouraging inclusive perspectives, and supporting pragmatic curriculum integration."
HABIBI2017410,Micro-climatization and real-time digitalization effects on energy efficiency based on user behavior,"an approach to intelligent building energy management systems at the workplace level has the potential to save energy through the use of building information modeling (bim) and smart sensor systems. its development focuses on micro-climatization and real-time digitalization systems from an architects point of view. intelligent management systems (imss) have significant potential for energy savings, but they have not been fully used in buildings and cities. smart sensor systems based on user behavior will improve indoor environmental quality (ieq) and user comfort. a cost-effective strategy has been implemented by using a low-technology and high-performance approach. this work aims to reduce energy consumption and provide comfort conditions by learning user behavior. furthermore, it seeks to create a real-time system with regard to the functions of developed technologies. in order to improve energy efficiency and comfort conditions, smart sensor systems and digital simulation tools play a crucial role in finding optimal solutions to optimization problems."
WEINTROP201883,"How block-based, text-based, and hybrid block/text modalities shape novice programming practices","there is growing diversity in the design of introductory programming environments. where once all novices learned to program in conventional text-based languages, today, there exists a growing ecosystem of approaches to programming including graphical, tangible, and scaffolded text environments. to date, relatively little work has explored the relationship between the design of novice programming environments and the programming practices they engender in their users. this paper seeks to shed light on this dimension of learning to program through the careful analysis of novice programmers experiences learning with a hybrid blocktext programming environment. specifically, this paper is concerned with how novices leverage the various affordances designed into programming environments and programming languages to support their early efforts to author programs. we explore this relationship through the construct of modality using data from a study conducted in a high school computer science classroom in which students spent five weeks working in block-based, text-based, and hybrid blocktext programming environments. this paper uses a detailed vignette of a novice writing a program in the hybrid environment as a way to characterize emerging programming practices, then presents analyses of programming trends from the full study population to speak to the generality of the practices identified in the vignette. the analyses focus not only on characterizing authoring strategies but also on identifying patterns in novices help-seeking behaviors. by focusing on how modality influences novices emerging programming practices, this paper contributes to our understanding of the relationship between programming environment and learning, illuminating the role of design in shaping introductory programming experiences."
LOUSTAU2022100544,Characterizing the research-practice gap in children’s interactive storytelling systems,"storytelling support has been and continues to be a recurring theme in childcomputer interaction research, especially as it pertains to education. this work has spilled over into practice, and, in the last few decades, a large number of storytelling systems for children have been developedboth as research prototypes and commercial applications. however, through a systematic analysis of 75 research-based storytelling systems and 39 commercial systems, we find that there remains a problematic gap between research and practice with respect to products in interactive storytelling and childcomputer interaction, echoing the well-documented research-practice gap in the general hci field. we characterize the nature of this gap, highlighting design themes promoted by research-based systems that are not as prevalent in commercial systems, such as tangibility and narrative scaffolds, and vice-versa. understanding the main areas of discrepancy between research and practice can help focus efforts to close the research-practice gap in storytelling systems for children."

FERNANDEZLLAMAS2018460,May I teach you? Students' behavior when lectured by robotic vs. human teachers,"social robots have been and are currently being used in many projects, research initiatives and experiments, but we know relatively little about them compared to humans when performing a social task such as teaching. using an experiment in which a robot and a human teacher were used for teaching computational concepts to a group of k-12 students, the main goal of this paper is not to analyze the scores obtained in the post-test performed, but to focus on the students attitudes towards robots. in order to do this, a version of the nars and ras questionnaires, adapted for children, was used. the analysis of the results of these questionnaires considers differences between age groups and students lectured by a robot vs. a human teacher. we conclude that age is the main factor that affects students attitudes towards robots, although we also found other differences between the robot and the human teacher group."

GUERRAMACIAS2025e41099,"Development of transversal skills in higher education programs in conjunction with online learning: relationship between learning strategies, project-based pedagogical practices, e-learning platforms, and academic performance","this study investigates the development of transversal skills and their association with academic performance in university students enrolled in on-campus programs with online activities. a cross-sectional, descriptive, and quantitative research was conducted with 252 students from a public university in mexico. transversal skills, socioformative project-based practices, learning strategies, and the relevance of online activities were assessed using validated rubrics. the results indicated a low level of development in three transversal skills: research, entrepreneurship, and english, with the latter being the poorest rated. critical and creative thinking exhibited the highest level of development. in the didactic component, socioformative project-based pedagogical practices and learning strategies showed acceptable levels. students expressed satisfaction with complementary online activities, showing a preference for interactive videos and short videos under 4 min. regression analysis and structural equations were used to examine the relationships between various factors. results demonstrated that socioformative project-based pedagogical practices, learning strategies, and online education positively correlated with the development of transversal skills. furthermore, a higher level of transversal skills was associated with better academic averages among students. socioformative project-based pedagogical practices also correlated with academic performance through transversal skills. the study concludes that integrating online activities into on-campus programs, based on the socioformative pedagogical model, can enhance the development of transversal skills and improve academic performance. further research into the implementation of this educational model and its long-term impact on university education and professional success is recommended."
NASIR2022100093,Temporal pathways to learning: How learning emerges in an open-ended collaborative activity.,"the learning process depends on the nature of the learning environment, particularly in the case of open-ended learning environments, where the learning process is considered to be non-linear. in this paper, we report on the findings of employing a multimodal hidden markov model (hmm) based methodology to investigate the temporal learning processes of two types of learners that have learning gains and a type that does not have learning gains in an open-ended collaborative learning activity. considering log data, speech behavior, affective states and gaze patterns, we find that all learners start from a similar state of non-productivity, but once out of it they are unlikely to fall back into that state, especially in the case of the learners that have learning gains. those who have learning gains shift between two problem solving strategies, each characterized by both exploratory and reflective actions, as well as demonstrate speech and gaze patterns associated with these strategies, that differ from those who dont have learning gains. further, the teams that have learning gains also differ between themselves in the manner in which they employ the problem solving strategies over the interaction, as well as in the manner they express negative emotions while exhibiting a particular strategy. these outcomes contribute to understanding the multiple pathways of learning in an open-ended collaborative learning environment, and provide actionable insights for designing effective interventions."
GRAPIN201971,Precision: Toward a meaning-centered view of language use with English learners in the content areas,"to support english learners (els) in attaining rigorous content standards, u.s. federal legislation requires that english language proficiency (elp) standards align with content standards. whereas language use in content learning has traditionally been defined in terms of structure, content and language educators have devoted increased attention to precision. precision goes beyond the structural elements of language to the disciplinary meaning that those elements communicate. in this article, we define precision and distinguish it from vocabulary, accuracy, and complexity. then, we highlight divergent conceptions of precision in content standards and elp standards. in light of these divergent conceptions, we present work samples from an elementary science classroom to illustrate how precision of disciplinary meaning is essential to engaging in disciplinary practices of content standards. we close by proposing the need for a more meaning-centered view of language use with els in the content areas."
ZHUHADAR2017273,The next wave of innovation—Review of smart cities intelligent operation systems,"the use of new technologies in business models and infrastructure has been driven in part by the internet and globalization. the next trend of innovations is likely to come from humans ability to connect to machines and the data that comes from these connections. the ibm intelligent operation center (ioc) is a system of systems that is not intended to replace an existing physical infrastructure that gathers raw data. instead, it is intended to extract only the data necessary to optimize the operations of the organization. the types of data and integration into the ioc make efficient problem solving solutions readily available to city authorities. the user interface and standard operating procedure and the resource processing capabilities of the ioc indicate that this system is optimal for smart cities of the future with regard to improvement of quality of life and ease of navigation. the need for smart cities, universities, campuses, citizens, and students to drive growth of urban and regional economies is evident. in this article, a thorough analysis of the architectural design of an intelligent operational system is completed to present a smart solution for cities to unify departments and agencies under one umbrella."
YOUNESCARDENAS20171,Monitoring mangrove forests: Are we taking full advantage of technology?,"mangrove forests grow in the estuaries of 124 tropical countries around the world. because in-situ monitoring of mangroves is difficult and time-consuming, remote sensing technologies are commonly used to monitor these ecosystems. landsat satellites have provided regular and systematic images of mangrove ecosystems for over 30 years, yet researchers often cite budget and infrastructure constraints to justify the underuse this resource. since 2001, over 50 studies have used landsat or aster imagery for mangrove monitoring, and most focus on the spatial extent of mangroves, rarely using more than five images. even after the landsat archive was made free for public use, few studies used more than five images, despite the clear advantages of using more images (e.g. lower signal-to-noise ratios). the main argument of this paper is that, with freely available imagery and high performance computing facilities around the world, it is up to researchers to acquire the necessary programming skills to use these resources. programming skills allow researchers to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as image acquisition and processing, consequently reducing up to 60 of the time dedicated to these activities. these skills also help scientists to review and re-use algorithms, hence making mangrove research more agile. this paper contributes to the debate on why scientists need to learn to program, not only to challenge prevailing approaches to mangrove research, but also to expand the temporal and spatial extents that are commonly used for mangrove research."
STRAWHACKER2020100212,Designing with Genes in Early Childhood: An exploratory user study of the tangible CRISPEE technology,"biodesign, a speculative and creative offshoot from the field of bioengineering, is an area of stem that is growing in popularity in education settings, primarily because of its unique interdisciplinary lens that connects stem disciplinary knowledge and creative design practices. although this trend is currently limited to middle school, high school, and higher education, prior research suggests that children 5 years and older, may yield long-term gains from exploring developmentally-appropriate concepts from novel stem fields. although there is little research on educational technologies or resources to support young childrens curiosity and learning in this novel domain, some research suggests that young children may already be forming preconceptions about genetics and biology (e.g., from popular media). tangible technologies, which provide children qualitatively new, developmentally appropriate ways to engage with ideas and techniques, have been shown to support childrens engagement with foundational ideas relevant to biodesign, including the engineering design process. by applying developmentally appropriate constraints to our technology development (e.g., through frameworks such as the positive technological development), the research team developed and evaluated a novel tangible technology called crispee to introduce young children to concepts of biology and engineering. this article describes an experimental pilot study to investigate (1) how young children interact with the crispee technological prototype, and (2) what prior knowledge the average child might bring to an educational biodesign activity. implications for ongoing technology development and developmentally appropriate learning goals are discussed."
MAGANA2014367,Learning strategies and multimedia techniques for scaffolding size and scale cognition,"size and scale cognition is a critical aptitude associated with reasoning with concepts and systems in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem). however, the teaching and learning of concepts related to size and scale present major challenges because objects at certain scales are unable to be perceived by humans with the naked eye. a potential way to overcome this challenge could be by means of learning strategies coupled with multimedia learning. in this study we propose learning strategies, instantiated by multimedia are for learning tools that may result in improved learning of size and scale cognition based on the fs2c framework. this framework consists of five levels to characterize size and scale cognition and the cognitive processes supporting them. participants of this quasi-experimental design included 224 undergraduate students who experienced one of three different multimedia for learning tools, and then were assessed through five tasks whose design was based on the fs2c framework. results suggest that learning strategies prompting students to compare objects of different sizes, may increase their abilities in ordering and classifying objects. having students to interact with a logarithmic scale may also have increased participant posttest performance scores in the numerical proportional and absolute measurement tasks. finally, we propose that the use of multimedia for learning affordances like 3d interaction, zoom in and zoom out, and direct interaction with a scale metaphor may help students make explicit connections and become familiar with objects of different sizes and scales."
MARCU2022,Barriers and Considerations in the Design and Implementation of Digital Behavioral Interventions: Qualitative Analysis,"background digital behavioral interventions have become increasingly popular for their ability to support patient diagnosis and treatment, chronic disease self-management, behavior change, and adherence to recommended care. however, digital intervention development is impeded by challenges such as limited technical skills, limited access to developers, and cost. the purpose of this study is to elicit in-depth qualitative feedback from intervention developers who have interest in digital behavioral interventions but lack programming skills regarding the barriers they experience and key considerations in the design and implementation of digital interventions. objective this study aims to understand barriers in the design and implementation of digital behavioral interventions, as well as to identify key considerations for researchers who are developing these interventions. methods we conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 18 researchers who had experience either designing (but not coding) digital behavioral interventions or running research studies with them. participants were a convenience sample of users of the computerized intervention authoring system platform, an existing no-code development platform for building digital intervention content, and were recruited through either direct email solicitation or snowball sampling. all interviews were conducted and recorded over videoconference between february and april 2020. recordings from interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed by multiple coders. results interviews were completed with 18 participants and lasted between 24 and 65 (mean 46.9, sd 11.3) minutes. interviewees were predominantly female (1718, 94) and represented different job roles, ranging from researcher to projectstudy staff. three key barriers in the development of digital behavior interventions were identified during interviews: lack of cross-disciplinary understanding; variability in recipients technology access, infrastructure, and literacy; and the idea that evidence-based in-person interactions do not translate directly to digital interactions. interviewees identified several key considerations that interventionists learned to prioritize, which have the potential to overcome these barriers and lead to successful interventions. conclusions barriers in the development of digital behavioral interventions are often created by a lack of cross-disciplinary understanding, which can lead to difficulties conceptualizing interventions, unrealistic expectations in terms of cost, and confusion about the development process. moreover, concerns about research study participant characteristics and access to technology, as well as the translation of in-person interventions to digital, are apparent. appropriate training in how to work with software development teams may help future digital behavior intervention creators overcome these barriers and may lead to new, exciting innovations in this space."
SMITH20189,Participatory design for sustainable social change,"tendencies in contemporary participatory design suggest a move away from engagement of limited stakeholders in preconfigured design processes and predefined technology outcomes, towards more complex and long-term engagement with heterogeneous communities and larger ecologies of social and technological transformation. building on core values of participatory design, we introduce three dimensions of engagement of scoping, developing and scaling that we argue can be essential in developing a holistic approach to participatory design as a sustainable practice of social change. the dimensions foreground central aspects of participatory design research that are discussed in relation to a long-term project exploring design and digital fabrication technologies in danish primary and secondary education."
PARHI2022108062,Factors affecting Industry 4.0 adoption – A hybrid SEM-ANN approach,"industry 4.0 is a technology-driven digital transformation to enable data-driven decision-making based on real-time data to enhance the competitiveness of traditional manufacturing. moving forward, adopting industry 4.0 is an evident requirement for manufacturers to remain competitive. currently, in the early stages of adoption in most industries and countries, there is an evident lack of foundational industry 4.0 knowledge among decision-makers. there are few studies on the adoption of industry 4.0; however, they focus on specific domains like cloud computing, virtual reality, iot, etc., and are primarily set in developed countries. this research proposes a multi-stage hybrid analytic approach whereby the research model was tested using structural equation modelling (sem). the sem results were used as inputs for the artificial neural networks (ann) to determine significant predictors for the adoption of industry 4.0 in indian manufacturing industries. a comprehensive sample of 350 responses from various indian manufacturers was collected and analyzed. results revealed that the factors viz. software infrastructure (si), system flexibility (sf), operational accuracy (oa), and the technical capabilities (tc) play a dominant role in the successful adoption intentions of industry 4.0 in india. manufacturers from india and other emerging economies will benefit from the findings of this study by concentrating and improving on the dominant adoption factors of industry 4.0. concluding, we discuss the studys results and derive lessons learned for stakeholders, including managers, consultants, policymakers, and regulatory authorities."

LITTS2021100295,Examining the materiality and spatiality of design scaffolds in computational making,"as researchers focus more on engaging youth with advanced technologies to build computational skills, there is a need to develop tools that support youth to become creators of digital content rather than consumers of these technologies. scholars refer to this shift in becoming creators of technology as computational making, which enables new forms of learning and thinking at the intersection of the physical and the digital. the interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. in this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths computational making design processes. we present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making. our insights highlight a significant need for sharing scholarship and design work on implementing design scaffolds in computational making contexts toward the collective goal of developing a system of design scaffolds to effectively support learners thinking across the interdisciplinary, multimodal problem spaces unique to computational making."
FRECHETTE2021137,Executive control in dual language learning preschoolers: The association between Hot and cool executive control and science achievement,"the number of dual language learners (dlls) in the united states is rapidly increasing, with over 25 of the preschoolers speaking a language other than english at home leading to a need to examine skills that contribute to their achievement. executive control (ec), or the ability to regulate attention, affect, and behavior effectively, is one skill that is particularly important for preschool children to develop. ec has been examined for monolingual children as a single construct, and as two related constructs, cool executive control (cec) and hot executive control (hec), and is associated with later academic outcomes. the purpose of this study was to extend the ec research to dll preschoolers, determine if ec is a one or two factor construct in a sample of dlls, and examine if the construct relates to dll childrens science achievement. structural equation modeling was used with a sample of 181 dll children enrolled in head start. in line with previous research on monolingual head start children, ec emerged as two distinct latent factors, cec and hec. this study also examined the association between concurrent cec, hec, and science achievement. cec was positively associated with dlls science achievement, whereas hec was not. these findings stress the importance of measuring the two dimensions of dlls ec separately as they differentially relate to science achievement."
LI2020103899,Longitudinal clustering of students’ self-regulated learning behaviors in engineering design,"it is vital to develop an understanding of students self-regulatory processes in the domains of stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) for the quality delivery of stem education. however, most studies have followed a variable-centered approach, leaving open the question of how specific srl (self-regulated learning) behaviors group within individual learners. furthermore, little is known about how students srl profiles unfold over time in stem education, specifically in the context of engineering design. in this study, we examined the change of students srl profiles over time as 108 middle school students designed green buildings in a simulation-based computer-aided design (cad) environment. we identified three distinct srl profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and minimally self-regulated learners. in addition, we found that students with different profile memberships differed significantly in their design performance. specifically, adaptive self-regulated learners outperformed minimally self-regulated learners on design completeness, whereas reflective-oriented self-regulated learners demonstrated higher design efficiency than minimally self-regulated learners. this study provides researchers with both theoretical and methodological insights concerning srl dynamics. findings from this research also inform practitioners about the design of adaptive interventions."
CORDASCO201815,Distributed MASON: A scalable distributed multi-agent simulation environment,"computational social science (css) involves interdisciplinary fields and exploits computational methods, such as social network analysis as well as computer simulation with the goal of better understanding social phenomena. agent-based models (abms) represent an effective research tool for css and consist of a class of models, which, aim to emulate or predict complex phenomena through a set of simple rules (i.e., independent actions, interactions and adaptation), performed by multiple agents. the efficiency and scalability of abms systems are typically obtained distributing the overall computation on several machines, which interact with each other in order to simulate a specific model. unfortunately, the design of a distributed simulation model is particularly challenging, especially for domain experts who sporadically are computer scientists and are not used to developing parallel code. d-mason framework is a distributed version of the mason library for designing and executing abms in a distributed environment ensuring scalability and easiness. d-mason enable the developer to exploit the computing power of distributed environment in a transparent manner; the developer has to do simple incremental modifications to existing mason models, without re-designing them. this paper presents several novel features and architectural improvements introduced in the d-mason framework: an improved space partitioning strategy, a distributed 3d field, a distributed network field, a decentralized communication layer, a novel memory consistency mechanism and the integration to cloud environments. full documentation, additional tutorials, and other material can be found at https:github.comisislab-unisadmason where the framework can be downloaded."
ALE2022100478,A systematic survey on embodied cognition: 11 years of research in child–computer interaction,"embodied cognition is a concept that has been extensively explored by scholars within the childcomputer interaction community. however, there is a lack of a synthesis of this research to clarify the fields benefits and drawbacks. this paper presents a survey of articles published between 2010 and 2020 in the interaction design and children (idc) conference and the international journal of childcomputer interaction (ijcci). we retrieved 158 papers using the keyword embodied cognition and its derivatives. further screening narrowed these down to 43. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current landscape of embodied research by reporting the most common subject areas of application, forms, and modes of embodiment, and the role of children and adults. our contribution is twofold: we highlight the main trends around these themes within the field, and we provide eight critical areas of future research. by illustrating new challenges and opportunities, we aim to support the growth of this area of research within the cci community."
GROSSMAN201718,Pedagogy and tools for teaching parallel computing at the sophomore undergraduate level,"as the need for multicore-aware programmers rises in both science and industry, computer science departments in universities around the usa are having to rethink their parallel computing curriculum. at rice university, this rethinking took the shape of comp 322, an introductory parallel programming course that is required for all bachelors students. comp 322 teaches students to reason about the behavior of parallel programs, educating them in both the high level abstractions of task-parallel programming as well as the nitty gritty details of working with threads in java. in this paper, we detail the structure, principles, and experiences of comp 322, gained from 6 years of teaching parallel programming to second-year undergraduates. we describe in detail two particularly useful tools that have been integrated into the curriculum: the hjlibparallel programming library and the habanero autograder for parallel programs. we present this work with the hope that it will help augment improvements to parallel computing education at other universities."
YURKOFSKY20191,Expanding outcomes: Exploring varied conceptions of teacher learning in an online professional development experience,"online technologies hold promise to support more personalized teacher professional development (pd) experiences, but fulfilling this promise requires heightened attention to what teachers value about the outcomes of their learning. this paper uses the example of the creative computing online workshop (ccow) to explore outcomes that teachers described as valuable: exposure to new ideas, rethinking classroom practice, and new relationships with their surrounding world. we discuss how the diversity, specificity, and nonlinearity of these outcomes extend teacher pd research, and suggest implications of this expanded framework for the design and evaluation of pd in both in-person and online contexts."
CHEN2025205,"Application of machine learning in higher education to predict students’ performance, learning engagement and self-efficacy: a systematic literature review","purpose in recent years, studies have shown that machine learning significantly improves student performance and retention and reduces the risk of student dropout and withdrawal. however, there is a lack of empirical research reviews focusing on the application of machine learning to predict student performance in terms of learning engagement and self-efficacy and exploring their relationships. hence, this paper conducts a systematic research review on the application of machine learning in higher education from an empirical research perspective. designmethodologyapproach this systematic review examines the application of machine learning (ml) in higher education, focusing on predicting student performance, engagement and self-efficacy. the review covers empirical studies from 2016 to 2024, utilizing a prisma framework to select 67 relevant articles from major databases. findings the findings show that ml applications are widely researched and published in high-impact journals. the primary functions of ml in these studies include performance prediction, engagement analysis and self-efficacy assessment, employing various ml algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks. ensemble learning algorithms generally outperform single algorithms regarding accuracy and other evaluation metrics. common model evaluation metrics include accuracy, f1 score, recall and precision, with newer methods also being explored. research limitationsimplications first, empirical research literature was selected from only four renowned electronic journal databases, and the literature was limited to journal articles, with the latest review literature and conference papers published in the form of conference papers also excluded, which led to empirical research not obtaining the latest views of researchers in interdisciplinary fields. second, this review focused mainly on the analysis of student grade prediction, learning engagement and self-efficacy and did not study students risk, dropout rates, retention rates or learning behaviors, which limited the scope of the literature review and the application field of machine learning algorithms. finally, this article only conducted a systematic review of the application of machine learning algorithms in higher education and did not establish a metadata list or carry out metadata analysis. originalityvalue the review highlights mls potential to enhance personalized education, early intervention and identifying at-risk students. future research should improve prediction accuracy, explore new algorithms and address current study limitations, particularly the narrow focus on specific outcomes and lack of interdisciplinary perspectives."
CHAO2016202,"Exploring students' computational practice, design and performance of problem-solving through a visual programming environment","this study aims to advocate that a visual programming environment offering graphical items and states of a computational problem could be helpful in supporting programming learning with computational problem-solving. a visual problem-solving environment for programming learning was developed, and 158 college students were conducted in a computational problem-solving activity. the students activities of designing, composing, and testing solutions were recorded by log data for later analysis. to initially unveil the students practice and strategies exhibited in the visual problem-solving environment, this study proposed several indicators to quantitatively represent students computational practice (sequence, selection, simple iteration, nested iteration, and testing), computational design (problem decomposition, abutment composition, and nesting composition), and computational performance (goal attainment and program size). by the method of cluster analysis, some empirical patterns regarding the students programming learning with computational problem-solving were identified. furthermore, comparisons of computational design and computational performance among the different patterns of computational practice were conducted. considering the relations of students computational practice to computational design and performance, evidence-based suggestions on the design of supportive programming environments for novice programmers are discussed."
WU201535,What makes an item more difficult? Effects of modality and type of visual information in a computer-based assessment of scientific inquiry abilities,"effects of multiple external representations on teaching and learning have been widely researched; however, relatively little is understood about how different types of representations used for item presentation influence students performances in computer-based assessments, particularly in those evaluating complex abilities. we designed a multimedia-based assessment for secondary school students that focused on scientific inquiry abilities (i.e., questioning, experimenting, analyzing, and explaining). through the participation of 1218 students (561 8th graders and 657 11th graders), the balanced arrangement of test booklets, and the use of a generalized partial credit rasch model, this study aimed at investigating how the modality of representations for item presentation (i.e., dynamic and static) and type of visual information (i.e., context and content) conveyed by the representations affected the item difficulty of the multimedia-based assessment. the results showed that overall items became slightly more difficult for students when the item presentation was static. also, the interaction effect between modality and grade was significant; when item presentation was changed from dynamic to static, the items became easier to the 8th graders, whereas they were more difficult to the 11th graders. the results suggested that older students might have more cognitive resources to retrieve information from dynamic displays to solve the assessment tasks successfully. additionally, while all interactions between modality and type of information on items with context visuals were not significant, there were significant interactions on four items with content visuals. a further examination of the items suggested that the tasks and the phenomena involved in the items may influence how modality affected the item difficulties when content visuals were used. these results implied that researchers need to pay special attention on the design of content visuals because they appear to be more influential than context ones to students performances of science assessments."
CHEAH2023103984,"Unpacking K-12 teachers’ technology-supported, equitable practices: A mixed-methods systematic review","we conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of research literature from 2009 to 2019 to unpack researchers conceptualizations about, approaches toward, and environmental supports in place that framed k-12 teachers technology-supported, equitable practices. findings revealed that equitable learning with technology was conceptualized as: (1) lifting students up through a neoliberal perspective; (2) attending to individual needs; (3) empowering students agency and civic participation; and (4) providing equal learning opportunities. technology approaches and environmental supports in tandem with these four conceptualizations are articulated. finally, we discuss the need for teachers to be reflective practitioners and critical enquirers when leveraging technology to promote equitable learning."

ANDERSON1996237,Chapter 8 - Interference and Inhibition in Memory Retrieval,"publisher summary this chapter discusses the causes of memory interference and the extent of situations in which these mechanisms operate. first, the chapter discusses some widely held assumptions about the situation of interference, focusing on the idea that such effects arise from competition for access via a shared retrieval cue. this notion is sufficiently general that it may be applied in a variety of interference settings, which is illustrated briefly. then the classical interference paradigms from which these ideas emerged are reviewed. the chapter also reviews more recent phenomena that both support and challenge classical conceptions of interference. these phenomena provide compelling illustrations of the generality of interference and, consequently, of the importance of understanding its mechanisms. a recent perspective on interference is highlighted that builds upon insights from modern work, while validating intuitions underlying several of the classical interference mechanisms. according to this new perspective, forgetting derives not from acquiring new memories per se, but from the impact of later retrievals of the newly learned material. after discussing findings from several paradigms that support this retrieval-based view, the chapter illustrates how forgetting might be linked to inhibitory processes underlying selective attention."
HSIAO2021102312,Who captures whom – Pokémon or tourists? A perspective of the Stimulus-Organism-Response model,"since its launch in 2016, pokmon go has attracted huge numbers of players, causing a boom in this game market. although it is not as popular as before, from time to time we still find crowds of players gathered in some spots where pokmon appear. numerous reports have explored this pokmon phenomenon; however, the exact reasons for its popularity remain unknown. the purpose of this study is to explore the post-adoption behavior of pokmon go players and its influential factors in the gaming and tourism industries. the theoretical model of stimulus-organism-response was drawn on to examine the impact of the environmental stimuli (social influence and media influence) on players internal organisms, which in turn affect their post-experience responses. moreover, gender differences were also examined in the hypothetical relationships. a total of 342 valid questionnaires from actual gamers were collected in this study, and data analysis was performed using a structural equation model. the results show that stimulus effects, such as social stimuli (critical mass and social interaction) and media stimuli (content timeliness and media richness), have significant impacts on the players internal gamified experience (attachment and conformity), which in turn affect their visit intention to catch creatures at certain attractions and to continue playing pokmon go. further, we have also found that players intention to visit pokmon spots is significantly correlated with their intention to continue playing the game. findings provide links between gamification and tourism literature. further theoretical and managerial implications are provided."

CHEN2020100002,Application and theory gaps during the rise of Artificial Intelligence in Education,"considering the increasing importance of artificial intelligence in education (aied) and the absence of a comprehensive review on it, this research aims to conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of influential aied studies. we analyzed 45 articles in terms of annual distribution, leading journals, institutions, countriesregions, the most frequently used terms, as well as theories and technologies adopted. we also evaluated definitions of aied from broad and narrow perspectives and clarified the relationship among aied, educational data mining, computer-based education, and learning analytics. results indicated that: 1) there was a continuingly increasing interest in and impact of aied research; 2) little work had been conducted to bring deep learning technologies into educational contexts; 3) traditional ai technologies, such as natural language processing were commonly adopted in educational contexts, while more advanced techniques were rarely adopted, 4) there was a lack of studies that both employ ai technologies and engage deeply with educational theories. findings suggested scholars to 1) seek the potential of applying ai in physical classroom settings; 2) spare efforts to recognize detailed entailment relationships between learners answers and the desired conceptual understanding within intelligent tutoring systems; 3) pay more attention to the adoption of advanced deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial network and deep neural network; 4) seek the potential of nlp in promoting precision or personalized education; 5) combine biomedical detection and imaging technologies such as electroencephalogram, and target at issues regarding learners during the learning process; and 6) closely incorporate the application of ai technologies with educational theories."
CHIU2013142,WISEngineering: Supporting precollege engineering design and mathematical understanding,"introducing engineering into precollege classroom settings has the potential to facilitate learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) concepts and to increase interest in stem careers. successful engineering design projects in secondary schools require extensive support for both teachers and students. computer-based learning environments can support both teachers and students to implement and learn from engineering design projects. however, there is a dearth of empirical research on how engineering approaches can augment learning in authentic k-12 settings. this paper presents research on the development and pilot testing of wisengineering, a new web-based engineering design learning environment. three middle school units were developed using a knowledge integration learning perspective and a scaffolded, informed engineering approach with the goal of improving understanding of standards-based mathematical concepts and engineering ideas. seventh grade math students from two teachers in a socioeconomically diverse and low-performing district participated in three wisengineering units over the course of a semester. students significantly improved their mathematical scores from pretest to posttest for all three projects and on state standardized tests. student, teacher, and administrator interviews reveal that wisengineering projects promoted collaboration, tolerance, and development of pro-social skills among at-risk youth. results demonstrate that informed engineering design projects facilitated through the wisengineering computer-based environment can help students learn common core mathematical concepts and principles. additionally, results suggest that wisengineering projects can be particularly beneficial for at-risk and diverse student populations."

PROFETA2018111,Bernstein’s levels of movement construction: A contemporary perspective,"explanation of how goal-directed movements are made manifest is the ultimate aim of the field classically referred to as motor control. essential to the sought-after explanation is comprehension of the supporting functional architecture. seven decades ago, the russian physiologist and movement scientist nikolai a. bernstein proposed a hierarchical model to explain the construction of movements. in his model, the levels of the hierarchy share a common language (i.e., they are commensurate) and perform complementing functions to bring about dexterous movements. the science of the control and coordination of movement in the phylum craniata has made considerable progress in the intervening seven decades. the contemporary body of knowledge about each of bernsteins hypothesized functional levels is both more detailed and more sophisticated. a natural consequence of this progress, however, is the relatively independent theoretical development of a given level from the other levels. in this essay, we revisit each level of bernsteins hierarchy from the joint perspectives of (a) the ecological approach to perception-action and (b) dynamical systems theory. we review a substantial and relevant body of literature produced in different areas of study that are accommodated by this ecological-dynamical version of bernsteins levels. implications for the control and coordination of movement and the challenges to producing a unified theory are discussed."
GRAY2019124,BrainQuest: The use of motivational design theories to create a cognitive training game supporting hot executive function,"for children to yield greater mental performance abilities in real world settings, training approaches should offer practice in problems which have an affective component requiring social interactions, and be motivating over a sustained period. current cognitive training games often overlook the important relationship between cognition and emotion, characterised by hot executive function, and correlated with fundamental academic and life outcomes. here, we present robust qualitative evidence from a case study which documents the social relationships, motivation and engagement of a class of ten-year-old children who used an active smartphone cognitive training game called brainquest in their physical education lessons over a period of 5 weeks. game design elements which are intended to move beyond simple gamification of cognitive tests are presented, along with a discussion of how these design elements worked in practice. the paper also presents and discusses the impact of the game upon the cognitive and emotional regulatory skills, characterised by executive function skills, based on the findings of this initial work. we conclude with recommendations for the designers of cognitive training games in the future and discussion of appropriate research methods for future gamification studies."
IIVARI2022100408,Critical agenda driving child–computer interaction research—Taking a stock of the past and envisioning the future,"there is a revitalized interest in power and politics around design and technology in the humancomputer interaction (hci) field. childcomputer interaction (cci) research community has also shown arousing interest towards the topic. however, despite this emerging interest, the cci research community has remained quite silent about the potential of a critical agenda for cci. few studies have explicitly addressed critical research or critical design. this study introduces the notion of a critical agenda for cci research and identifies cci studies that are linked with the critical agenda, revealing that there are cci studies showing emerging interests and seeds for addressing the critical agenda. overall, this study explores the state-of-the-art critical research tradition in cci and explicates the potential of this tradition for making the world a better place through design and technology in collaboration with children."
ESTEFO2019226,The Robot Operating System: Package reuse and community dynamics,"ros, the robot operating system, offers a core set of software for operating robots that can be extended by creating or using existing packages, making it possible to write robotic software that can be reused on different hardware platforms. with thousands of packages available per stable distribution, encapsulating algorithms, sensor drivers, etc., it is the de facto middleware for robotics. like any software ecosystem, ros must evolve in order to keep meeting the requirements of its users. in practice, packages may end up being abandoned between releases: no one may be available to update a package, or newer packages offer similar functionality. as such, we wanted to identify and understand the evolution challenges faced by the ros ecosystem. in this article, we report our findings after interviewing 19 ros developers in depth, followed by a focus group (4 participants) and an online survey of 119 ros community members. we specifically focused on the issues surrounding package reuse and how to contribute to existing packages. to conclude, we discuss the implications of our findings, and propose five recommendations for overcoming the identified issues, with the goal of improving the health of the ros ecosystem."
KOLODNY2015252,The problem of multimodal concurrent serial order in behavior,"the problem of serial order in behavior, as formulated and discussed by lashley (1951), is arguably more pervasive and more profound both than originally stated and than currently appreciated. we spell out two complementary aspects of what we term the generalized problem of behavior: (i) multimodality, stemming from the disparate nature of the sensorimotor variables and processes that underlie behavior, and (ii) concurrency, which reflects the parallel unfolding in time of these processes and of their asynchronous interactions. we illustrate these on a number of examples, with a special focus on language, briefly survey the computational approaches to multimodal concurrency, offer some hypotheses regarding the manner in which brains address it, and discuss some of the broader implications of these as yet unresolved issues for cognitive science."
LAW2021100321,Augmented reality applications for K-12 education: A systematic review from the usability and user experience perspective,"in the past two decades, we have witnessed soaring efforts in applying augmented reality (ar) technology in education. several systematic literature reviews (slrs) were conducted to study ar educational applications (areas) and associated methodologies, primarily from the pedagogical rather than from the humancomputer interaction (hci) perspective. these reviews vary in goal, scale, scope, technique, outcome and quality. to bridge the gaps identified in these slrs, ours is to meet fourfold objectives: to ground the analysis deeper in the usability and user experience (ux) core concepts and methods; to study the learning effect and usabilityux of areas and their relations by learner age; to reflect on the prevailing slr process and propose improvement; to draw implications for the future development of areas. our searches in four databases returned 714 papers of which 42, together with 7 from three existing slrs, were included in the final analysis. several intriguing findings have been identified: (i) the insufficient grounding in usabilityux frameworks indicates that there seems a disconnection between the hci and technology-enhanced learning community; (ii) a lack of innovative ar-specific usabilityux evaluation methods and the continuing reliance on questionnaire may hamper the advances of areas; (iii) the learner age seems not a significant factor in determining the perceived usability and ux or the learning effect of areas; (iv) a limited number of studies at home suggests the missed opportunity of mobilizing parents to support children to deploy areas in different settings; (v) the number of areas for children with special needs remains disappointedly low; (vi) the threat of predatory journals to the quality of bibliometric sources amplifies the need for a robust approach to the quality assessment for slr and transparency of interim results. implications of these issues for future research and practice on areas are drawn."
FIGL201596,Influence factors for local comprehensibility of process models,"the main aim of this study is to investigate human understanding of process models and to develop an improved understanding of its relevant influence factors. aided by assumptions from cognitive psychology, this article attempts to address specific deductive reasoning difficulties based on process models. the authors developed a research model to capture the influence of two effects on the cognitive difficulty of reasoning tasks: (i) the presence of different control-flow patterns (such as conditional or parallel execution) in a process model and (ii) the interactivity of model elements. based on solutions to 61 different reasoning tasks by 155 modelers, the results from this study indicate that the presence of certain control-flow patterns influences the cognitive difficulty of reasoning tasks. in particular, sequence is relatively easy, while loops in a model proved difficult. modelers with higher process modeling knowledge performed better and rated subjective difficulty of loops lower than modelers with lower process modeling knowledge. the findings additionally support the prediction that interactivity between model elements is positively related to the cognitive difficulty of reasoning. our research contributes to both academic literature on the comprehension of process models and practitioner literature focusing on cognitive difficulties when using process models."
STEPHENS2021103466,Landscape changes and their hydrologic effects: Interactions and feedbacks across scales,"human activities have extensively altered landscapes throughout the world and further changes are expected in the future. anthropogenic impacts such as land use change, groundwater extraction and dam construction, along with the effects of climate change, interact with natural factors including soil weathering and erosion. together, these processes create a constantly shifting, dynamic terrestrial environment that violates the assumption of stationarity commonly applied in hydrology. consequently, hydrologists need to rethink both statistical and calibrated models to account for complex environmental processes. we review the literature on human-landscape-hydrological interactions to identify processes and feedbacks that influence water balances. most of the papers covered consider only a few of these processes at a time and focus on structural attributes of the interactions rather than the short and long-term dynamics. we identify challenges in representing the scale-dependence, environmental connectivity and human-water interactions that characterize complex, dynamic landscapes. a synthesis of the findings posits connections between different landscape changes, as well as the associated timescales and level of certainty. a case study explores how different processes could combine to drive long-term shifts in catchment behavior. recognizing that some important questions remain unaddressed by traditional approaches, we suggest the concept of big laboratories in which multifaceted experiments are conducted in the environment by artificially inducing landscape change. these experiments would be accompanied by mechanistic modeling to both untangle experimental results and improve the theoretical basis of environmental models. an ambitious program of physical and virtual experimentation is needed to progress hydrologic prediction for dynamic landscapes. plain language summary the earths surface is constantly changing due to human-driven and natural processes. shifts may be driven by humans directly (e.g. via land use change) or indirectly (e.g. by driving climate change that causes shifts in ecological communities). other changes are natural, such as certain soil processes that lead to shifts in texture and properties over time. in many places, landscape change is now occurring at unprecedented rates. this impacts the water cycle, creating a need for models that are robust under changing conditions. our paper synthesizes a wide range of literature on key aspects of landscape change that have wide-ranging implications for hydrology. we focus on the impacts of processes at different spatial and temporal scales, along with feedbacks between various environmental and anthropogenic shifts. we discuss connections between different landscape changes and the timescales over which they each affect the water cycle. a case study is presented to highlight the potential for cascading landscape disturbances that could alter long-term catchment response. recognizing limitations in traditional data collection and modeling, we introduce the concept of big laboratories to conduct environmental experiments under landscape change, providing an avenue for addressing the complex questions around hydrology in a changing world."
OZTOP201343,"Mirror neurons: Functions, mechanisms and models","mirror neurons for manipulation fire both when the animal manipulates an object in a specific way and when it sees another animal (or the experimenter) perform an action that is more or less similar. such neurons were originally found in macaque monkeys, in the ventral premotor cortex, area f5 and later also in the inferior parietal lobule. recent neuroimaging data indicate that the adult human brain is endowed with a mirror neuron system, putatively containing mirror neurons and other neurons, for matching the observation and execution of actions. mirror neurons may serve action recognition in monkeys as well as humans, whereas their putative role in imitation and language may be realized in human but not in monkey. this article shows the important role of computational models in providing sufficient and causal explanations for the observed phenomena involving mirror systems and the learning processes which form them, and underlines the need for additional circuitry to lift up the monkey mirror neuron circuit to sustain the posited cognitive functions attributed to the human mirror neuron system."
CARETTE202215,Chapter Two - Embracing the laws of physics: Three reversible models of computation,"our main models of computation (the turing machine and the ram) and most modern computer architectures make fundamental assumptions about which primitive operations are realizable on a physical computing device. the consensus is that these primitive operations include logical operations like conjunction, disjunction and negation, as well as reading and writing to a large collection of memory locations. this perspective conforms to a macro-level view of physics and indeed these operations are realizable using macro-level devices involving thousands of electrons. this point of view is however incompatible with computation realized using quantum devices or analyzed using elementary thermodynamics as both these fundamental physical theories imply that information is a conserved quantity of physical processes and hence of primitive computational operations. our aim is to redevelop foundational computational models in a way that embraces the principle of conservation of information. we first define what information is and what its conservation means in a computational setting. we emphasize the idea that computations must be reversible transformations on data. one can think of data as modeled using topological spaces and programs as modeled by reversible deformations of these spaces. we then illustrate this idea using three notions of data and their associated reversible computational models. the first instance only assumes unstructured finite data, i.e., discrete topological spaces. the corresponding notion of reversible computation is that of permutations. we show how this simple model subsumes conventional computations on finite sets. we then consider a modern structured notion of data based on the curryhoward correspondence between logic and type theory. we develop the corresponding notion of reversible deformations using a sound and complete programming language for witnessing type isomorphisms and proof terms for commutative semirings. we then move up a level to examine spaces that treat programs as data, which is a crucial notion for any universal model of computation. to derive the corresponding notion of reversible programs between programs, i.e., reversible program equivalences, we look at the higher dimensional analog to commutative semirings: symmetric rig groupoids. the coherence laws for these groupoids turn out to be exactly the sound and complete reversible program equivalences we seek. we conclude with some possible generalizations inspired by homotopy type theory and survey several open directions for further research."

MOORE2024493,"Chapter 17 - The application of knowledge in soil microbiology, ecology, and biochemistry (SMEB) to the solution of today’s and future societal needs","this chapter presents an ecosystem-based framework for applying soil microbiology, ecology, and biochemistry (smeb) principles and processes to address the preservation and sustainability of global soils to meet societal needs in the face of environmental change. the approach is organized around the un sustainable development goals, focusing on ecosystem services provided by soil microbes and soil biota at the nexus of food, water, and energy. the role of soil biota in ecosystem processes and the impacts of human activities on those processes are presented. the approach promotes conservation and regenerative methods that manage natural smeb processes to optimize ecosystem services and minimize alterations in natural processes. adoption and application of sound smeb science will require a high degree of literacy among different stakeholders to codevelop management practices and regulatory policy. the approach also advocates promoting smeb science literacy within the education system through reforms in science standards and curricula."
KHRENNIKOV2006225,Quantum-like brain: “Interference of minds”,"we present a contextualist statistical realistic model for quantum-like representations in physics, cognitive science, and psychology. we apply this model to describe cognitive experiments to check quantum-like structures of mental processes. the crucial role is played by interference of probabilities for mental observables. recently one such experiment based on recognition of images was performed. this experiment confirmed our prediction on the quantum-like behavior of mind. in our approach quantumness of mind has no direct relation to the fact that the brain (as any physical body) is composed of quantum particles. we invented a new terminology quantum-like (ql) mind. cognitive ql-behavior is characterized by a nonzero coefficient of interference . this coefficient can be found on the basis of statistical data. there are predicted not only cos-interference of probabilities, but also hyperbolic cosh-interference. this interference was never observed for physical systems, but we could not exclude this possibility for cognitive systems. we propose a model of brain functioning as a ql-computer (there is a discussion on the difference between quantum and ql computers)."
REISENZEIN20096,Emotions as metarepresentational states of mind: Naturalizing the belief–desire theory of emotion,"describes the outlines of a computational explication of the beliefdesire theory of emotion, a variant of cognitive emotion theory. according to the proposed explication, a core subset of emotions including surprise are nonconceptual products of hardwired mechanisms whose primary function is to subserve the monitoring and updating of the central representational system of humans, the beliefdesire system. the posited emotion-producing mechanisms are analogous to sensory transducers; however, instead of sensing the world, they sense the state of the beliefdesire system and signal important changes in this system, in particular the fulfillment and frustration of desires and the confirmation and disconfirmation of beliefs. because emotions represent this information about the state of the representational system in a nonconceptual format, emotions are nonconceptual metarepresentations. it is argued that this theory of emotions provides for a deepened understanding of the role of emotions in cognitive systems and solves several problems of psychological emotion theory."
SERHOLT2018250,Breakdowns in children's interactions with a robotic tutor: A longitudinal study,"in recent years, there has been a growing research interest towards exploring the benefit of childrobot interaction for educational purposes through the use of social robotics. despite the label, such robots are typically only social within scripted activities. the current study takes a critical look at the case of a robotic tutor which was implemented in an elementary school for 3.5 months, where children repeatedly took turns interacting with the robot individually as well as in pairs. the aim of the study was to explore what caused breakdowns in childrens interactions with the robotic tutor. in this qualitative study, over 14 h of video recordings of childrens interaction sessions were analyzed in-depth through interaction analysis and thematic analysis. the results comprise four themes to explain why childrens interactions with the robotic tutor break down: (1) the robots inability to evoke initial engagement and identify misunderstandings, (2) confusing scaffolding, (3) lack of consistency and fairness, and finally, (4) controller problems. the implications of these breakdowns for the educational use of robots are discussed, and it is concluded that several challenges need to be rigorously addressed in order for robotic tutors to be able to feature in education."
HORVATH2015161,Ubiquitous computer aided design: A broken promise or a Sleeping Beauty?,"as a novel computational approach, ubiquitous computing was emerging at the beginning of the 1980s and has reached a rather mature level by now. it assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. this survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. the specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of cad systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. first, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. the literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. one reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. in combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of cad system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. the literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as braincomputer interfacing, cyberphysical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing."
BARRON2010178,Predictors of creative computing participation and profiles of experience in two Silicon Valley middle schools,"examination of the digital divide has increasingly gone beyond the study of differences in physical access to computers to focus on individuals use of technological tools for empowered and generative uses. in this research study, we investigated the relationship between access to tools and experience with creative production activities. our participants included 160 8th grade learners from two public middle schools. the local communities represented by the two schools differed in parent education levels, proportion of recent immigrants, and average family income. findings indicated substantial variability in students history of creative production experiences within both communities. three sets of analyses were completed. first, the two school populations were compared with respect to average levels of student creative production experience, access to tools at home, use of learning resources, frequency of technology use, and access to computing outside of their home. second, correlates of variability in individuals breadth of experience with creative production activities were explored across both schools through a regression analysis. the resulting model indicated that students experience was best predicted by the number of technology tools available at home, number of learning resources used, frequency of computer use at home, and non-home access network size. in a third analysis, profiles of experience were created based on both breadth and depth of experience; the resulting four groups of students were compared. more experienced students utilized a broader range of learning resources, had access to more tools at home, taught a wider range of people, and were more confident in their computing skills. the groups did not differ in their self-reports of interest in learning more about technology."
KIRK201771,Chapter 4 - Memory and data locality,"this chapter introduces the concepts of memory bound application. it uses matrix multiplication to illustrate opportunities for reducing the number of global memory accesses. it then introduces the tiling technique where barrier synchronization is used to coordinate the timing of executing threads for improved locality and reduced global memory accesses. the tiling techniques, however, involve additional complexities in boundary checks. the chapter uses matrix multiplication to illustrate the additional boundary checks needed for a tiled kernel to be applicable to arbitrary matrix sizes. the chapter concludes with an overview of how usage of shared memory and registers can affect the number of thread blocks that can be accommodated in each streaming multiprocessor."
KHALAJZADEH2025107570,Accessibility of low-code approaches: A systematic literature review,"context: model-driven approaches are increasingly used in different domains, such as education, finance and app development, in order to involve non-developers in the software development process. such tools are hugely dependent on visual elements and thus might not be accessible for users with specific challenges, e.g., visual impairments. objectives: to locate and analyse existing literature on the accessibility of low-code approaches, their strengths and weaknesses and key directions for future research. methods: we carried out a systematic literature review and searched through five leading databases for primary studies. we used both quantitative and qualitative methods for data synthesis. results: after reviewing and filtering 918 located studies, and conducting both backward and forward snowballing, we identified 38 primary studies that were included in our analysis. we found most papers focusing on accessibility of visual languages and block-based programming. conclusion: limited work has been done on improving low code programming environment accessibility. the findings of this systematic literature review will assist researchers and developers in understanding the accessibility issues in low-code approaches and what has been done so far to develop accessible approaches."

LEECULTURA2022100355,Children’s play and problem-solving in motion-based learning technologies using a multi-modal mixed methods approach,"motion-based learning technologies (mblt) offer a promising approach for integrating play and problem-solving behaviour within childrens learning. the proliferation of sensor technology has driven the field of learning technology towards the development of tools and methods that may benefit from the produced multi-modal data (mmd). such data can be used to uncover cognitive, affective and physiological processes during learning activities. combining mmd with more traditionally exercised assessment tools, such as video content analysis, provides a more holistic understanding of childrens learning experiences and has the potential to enable the design of educational technologies capable of harmonising childrens cognitive, affective and physiological processes, while promoting appropriately balanced play and problem-solving efforts. however, the use of an mmd mixed methods approach that combines qualitative and mmd data to understand childrens behaviours during engagement with mblt is rather unexplored. we present an in-situ study where 26 children, ages 1012, solved a motion-based sorting task for learning geometry. we continuously and unobtrusively monitored childrens learning experiences using mmd collection via eye-trackers, wristbands, kinect joint tracking, and a web camera. we devised sp3, a novel observational scheme that can be used to understand childrens solo interactions with mblt, and applied it to identify and extract childrens evoked play and problem-solving behaviour. collective analysis of the mmd and video codes provided explanations of childrens task performance through consideration of their holistic learning experience. lastly, we applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between various mmd measurements and childrens play and problem-solving behaviours. this research sheds light on the opportunities offered in the confluence of video coding (a traditional method in learning sciences) and mmd (an emerging method that leverages sensors proliferation) for investigating childrens behaviour with mblt."
WANG2021157,Chapter 5 - Battery state-of-charge estimation methods,"with the large-scale promotion of new energy vehicles, the demand for power batteries such as the lithium-ion type has increased. its service lifespan is closely related to the service condition. the important embodiment of the service condition is the battery state of charge, which can reflect its residual capacity. through accurate residual capacity, the battery application strategy can be planned to realize the battery operation of the best condition. the long service lifespan can be realized by adjusting the voltage and current. therefore, real-time accurate state estimation has a significant effect on battery management. the extended kalman filtering algorithm is introduced to estimate the state value under complex working conditions. the overview of the state-of-charge estimation is first conducted. after that, the equivalent modeling construction method is explored. the coordinate transformation treatment is implemented in the binary iterative calculation algorithm, according to which the algorithm is implemented. in the extended calculation process, the iterative prediction and correction strategies are introduced into the test. consequently, the pulse-power characteristic test is conducted to obtain the estimation features, considering a thermal influencing effect, a time-varying current condition, and a complex current rate verification."
PAYDAR2023165,Chapter 3 - Nuclear power reactions driven radiation hardening environments,"radiation hardening, also known as rad hardening, and radiation survivability testing are of critical importance to defense, aerospace, and energy industries. everyone knows that excessive exposure to radiation can cause severe damage to living things, but high radiation levels can also cause radiation damage to other objects, especially electronics. ionizing radiation in particular, including directly ionizing radiation such as alpha and beta particles and indirectly ionizing radiation such as gamma rays and neutron radiation, is profoundly damaging to the semiconductors that make up the backbone of all modern electronics. just one charged particle can interfere with thousands of electrons, causing signal noise, disrupting digital circuits, and even causing permanent physical radiation damage. radiation hardening involves designing radiation-tolerant electronics and components that are tolerant of the massive levels of ionizing radiation, such as cosmic outer space radiation, x-ray radiation in medical or security environments, and high energy radiation within nuclear power plants. in order to test these components and determine whether they are sufficiently hardened, radiation-hardened electronics manufacturers perform rigorous testing as part of their product manufacturing processes. components which pass these tests go into production and can be described as radiation-hardened; components that do not go back to design."
BARFAR2021113442,Peak cubes in service operations: Bringing multidimensionality into decision support systems,"companies like ritz carlton, disney and verizon are among many who have invested in analytics to improve their customers service experiences with the firms. extensive data are collected on all aspects of how customers interact or experience the products or services. research has shown the importance of the peak-end rule in service design; that is, providing a customer with good peak service levels and ending the service experience with high quality can enhance customer satisfaction and build loyalty. however, previous studies have examined this phenomenon only in contexts with unidimensional service levels. we introduce peak cubes, which enable service designers and scholars to pinpoint prominent service levels in multidimensional service experience profilesthereby extending current research on behavioral economics and service design to more general settings. results indicate the potential of multidimensional peak-end models to better predict customer satisfaction in various service scenarios. using shapley values in coalitional game theory, the resulting models can also inform service designers about the quality dimensions that are critical from the perspective of multidimensional peak-end heuristic and customer satisfaction. our research contributions and proposed methodology will enhance decision support systems with multidimensional capabilities and have applications to fields as diverse as service operations and healthcare."
MEYER202013,Changing Design Education for the 21st Century,"designers are entrusted with increasingly complex and impactful challenges. however, the current system of design education does not always prepare students for these challenges. when we examine what and how our system teaches young designers, we discover that the most valuable elements of the designers perspective and process are seldom taught. instead, some designers grow beyond their education through their experience working in industry, essentially learning by accident. many design programs still maintain an insular perspective and an inefficient mechanism of tacit knowledge transfer. meanwhile, skills for developing creative solutions to complex problems are increasingly essential. organizations are starting to recognize that designers bring something special to this type of work, a rational belief based upon numerous studies that link commercial success to a design-driven approach. so, what are we to do other learned professions such as medicine, law, and business provide excellent advice and guidance embedded within their own histories of professionalization. in this article, we borrow from their experiences to recommend a course of action for design. it will not be easy: it will require a study group to make recommendations for a roster of design and educational practices that schools can use to build a curriculum that matches their goals and abilities. and then it will require a conscious effort to bootstrap the design profession toward both a robust practitioner community and an effective professoriate, capable together of fully realizing the value of design in the 21st century. in this article, we lay out that path."
HAMILTON2023371,Chapter 16 - Natural Language Processing,"sensory evaluation is predicated on the use and interpretation of human language. we ask our subjects to describe their sensory experiences and affective responses, which we cannot directly observe. this formulation of sensory science encourages direct engagement with linguistics and in particular, a recent subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence called natural language processing (nlp, sometimes computational linguistics). in this chapter we will provide an introduction to natural language processing (nlp) for sensory scientists who wish to employ nlp as a rapid method for sensory evaluation. because nlp is a large, diverse, and rapidly evolving field, we will begin with a brief, pragmatic overview of the discipline, with an emphasis on key historical and current methods and applications. we will then briefly discuss the linguistic perspective and its application to sensory evaluation, with an aim to motivating the remaining chapter. following that, we will discuss key areas of nlp, from data collection to processing to analysis to advanced applications. throughout the chapter, we will use a consistent case study of natural-language descriptions for a food product to provide examples and illustrate nlp methods."
DOMINOWSKI19941,CHAPTER 1 - History of Research on Thinking and Problem Solving,"publisher summary the two problems that characterize the modern psychology of thinking are mental representation and mental computation. throughout the history of psychology, there has been an agreement that the essential features of a problem are that an organism has a goal but lacks a clear or well-learned route to the goal. thus the emphasis in research on problem solving has been on response discoveryhow the organism arrives at an effective, goal-attaining behavior. there have often been controversies over the role of learning or past experiences in problem solving. this chapter illustrates the conflict between emphases on learning and emphases on perception as central components of problem solving. because a problem solver must find a solution, it might seem inevitable that an essential activity tries different approaches makes errors until the right approach is found. earlier in problem-solving research, trial and error became associated with the view that acquiring a solution was a gradual, undirected process that did not involve perception or comprehension of problem requirements or structure."
SALAJ2024298,Competencies for Smart City Challenges,"it is acknowledged that technological innovation is needed in all sectors to cope with new demands. from social innovations, it introduces novel ideas, whether products, services, or models, to fulfil societal needs and foster new partnerships or collaborations. the aim is to enhance social interactions and elevate human well-being. development of cutting-edge digital technologies is reality. the challenge is on human resource side, how quickly we can prepare employees to adapt to the requirements of industry 4.0 and society 5.0. in the paper, the new competencies were identified with the business stakeholders by conducting a survey among industry partners to recognize the requirements for the future labor market. the stakeholders in the construction field act as target groups for monitoring and development of the competencies. the focus of the result part is on the competencies companies mostly miss from their employees from digital perspectives, e.g. reason to hire highly educated people, training possibilities for digitally upskilling employees, lacking appropriate competencies (critical thinking, systems and analytical thinking, information management, advanced computerit skills (ai), ensuring security). digital skills advanced datait skills were the competencies in that companies defined as key competencies expected to be developed in 21st-century higher education employees. it is highly important to consider the job market needs for development and to adopt the engineering education system to be responsive to the needs of labor market."
WOOD1990317,Verification of rule-based expert systems,"we are investigating the problem of establishing computational rather than syntactic properties of forward-chaining rule-based expert systems. we model an expert system as a computation on working memory, define its execution semantics, and present proof techniques suitable for those semantics. specifically, we model execution as a dijkstra guarded-do construct, and use dijkstras invariance theorem and weakest precondition predicate transformers to establish invariants (safety properties) and postconditions (liveness properties). our approach is an application of well-developed methods developed by dijkstra and others for the verification of procedural programs. this paper introduces the approach, reports some initial results, and discusses future work."
TAN2020101793,A graph-theoretic approach for the detection of phishing webpages,"over the years, various technical means have been developed to protect internet users from phishing attacks. to enrich the anti-phishing efforts, we capitalise on concepts from graph theories, and propose a set of novel graph features to improve the phishing detection accuracy. the initial phase of the proposed technique involved the extraction of hyperlinks in the webpage under scrutiny and fetching the corresponding neighbourhood webpages. during this process, the page linking data were collected, and used to construct a web graph which models the overall hyperlink and network structure of the webpage. from the web graph, graph measures were computed and extracted as graph features to derive a classifier for detecting phishing webpages. experimental results show that the proposed graph features achieve an improved overall accuracy of 97.8 when c4.5 was utilised as classifier, outperforming the existing conventional features derived from the same data samples. unlike conventional features, the proposed graph features leverage inherent phishing patterns that are only visible at a higher level of abstraction, thus making it robust and difficult to be evaded by direct manipulations on the webpage contents. our proposed graph-based technique also shows promising results when benchmarked against a prominent phishing detection technique. hence, the proposed technique is an important contribution to the existing anti-phishing research towards improving the detection performance."
KOLTAY20161,Chapter 1 - Shifting Research Paradigms Toward Research 2.0,"this chapter discusses how research 2.0 came into existence and how it developed into a leading paradigm of our era. this requires an outline of the socio-technical changes brought about by the development and widespread use of information and communications technologies, based on computers and leading to the appearance of social media. there is no one who would deny that researchers are central figures in research, so their skills and abilities will be briefly examined. research 2.0 is closely connected to the idea of open science that will be described, giving especial attention to its main constituent that is open access. open science also comprises the data-intensive paradigm of scientific research, which we consider in detail. a wider uptake of research 2.0 is inhibited by a number of the factors of scholarly communication, so we will enumerate them."

ROBSON2022101018,Searching for the principles of a less artificial A.I.,"what would it take to build a computer physician that can take its place amongst human peers currently, neural nets, especially as so-called deep learning nets, dominate what is popularly called artificial intelligence, but to many critics they seem to be little more than powerful data-analytic tools inspired by some of the more basic functions and regions of the human brain such as those involved in early processes in biological vision, classification, and categorization. the deeper nature of human intelligence as the term is normally meant, including relating to consciousness, has been the domain of philosophers, psychologists, and some neuroscientists. now, attention is turning to neuronal mechanisms in humans and simpler organisms as a basis of a truer ai with far greater potential. arguably, the approach required should be rooted in information theory and algorithmic science. but as discussed in this paper, caution is required: just any old information might not do. the information might need to be of a particular dynamical and actioning nature, and that might significantly impact the kind of computation and computer hardware required. overall, however, the authors do not favor emergent properties such as those based on complexity and quantum effects. despite the possible difficulties, such studies could, in return, have substantial benefits for biology and medicine beyond the computational tools that they produce to serve those disciplines."
ROMEROORGANVIDEZ2024112029,Data visualization guidance using a software product line approach,"data visualization aims to convey quantitative and qualitative information effectively by determining which techniques and visualizations are most appropriate for different situations and why. various software solutions can produce numerous visualizations of the same data set. however, data visualization encompasses a wide range of visual configurations that depend on factors such as the type of data being displayed, the different displays (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs, and pie charts), the visual components used to represent the data (e.g., lines, dots, and bars), and the specific visual attributes of those components (e.g., color, shape, size, and length). a similar problem arises when designing data tables, where the dimensionality of the data and its complexity influence the choice of the most appropriate structure (e.g., unidirectional, bidirectional). often, this broad spectrum of configurations requires a visualization expert who knows which techniques are best for which type of data source and what is to be conveyed. typically, researchers and developers lack knowledge of data visualization best practices and must learn the design principles that enable effective communication and the technical details of the specific software tool they use to generate visualizations. this paper proposes a software product line approach to model and realize the variability of the visualization design process, using feature models to encode knowledge about design best practices in graphs and charts. our approach involves solving visualization design variability through a stepwise configuration process and evaluating the proposal for a specific software visualization tool. our solution facilitates effective communication of quantitative results by helping researchers and developers select and generate the most effective visualizations for each case. this approach opens up new opportunities for research at the intersection of data visualization and variability."
BARRICELLI2019101,"End-user development, end-user programming and end-user software engineering: A systematic mapping study","end-user development (eud), end-programming (eup) and end-user software engineering (euse) are three related research fields that study methods and techniques for empowering end users to modify and create digital artifacts. this paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed at identifying and classifying scientific literature about eud, eup and euse in the time range january 2000may 2017. we selected 165 papers found through a manual selection of papers from specific conferences, journal special issues, and books, integrated with an automatic search on the most important digital libraries. the answer to our research question was built through a classification of the selected papers on seven dimensions: type of approach, interaction technique, phase in which the approach is adopted, application domain, target use, class of users, and type of evaluation. our findings suggest that eud, eup and euse are active research topics not only in humancomputer interaction, but also in other research communities. however, little cross-fertilization exists among the three themes, as well as unifying frameworks and approaches for guiding novice designers and practitioners. other findings highlight trends and gaps related to the analysis dimensions, which have implications on the design of future tools and suggest open issues for further investigations."
ALDAAJEH2022102754,The role of national cybersecurity strategies on the improvement of cybersecurity education,"digital information and telecommunication technologies have not only become essential to individuals daily lives but also to a nations sustained economic growth, societal well-being, critical infrastructure resilience, and national security. consequently, the protection of a nations cyber sovereignty from malicious acts is a major concern. this signifies the importance of cybersecurity education in facilitating the creation of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem and in supporting cyber sovereignty. this study reviews a sample from world-leading countries national cybersecurity strategic plans (ncsps) and analyzes the associated existing cybersecurity education and training improvement initiatives. furthermore, a proposal to adopt the goal-question-outcomes(gqo)strategies paradigm into cybersecurity education and training programs curricula improvement to national cybersecurity strategic goals is presented. the proposal maps cybersecurity strategic goals to cybersecurity skills and competencies using the national initiative for cybersecurity education (nice) framework. the newly proposed cybersecurity education and training programs curricula learning outcomes were generated from the gqostrategies paradigm based on the three major cybersecurity strategic goals: development of secure digital and information technology infrastructure and services, defending from sophisticated cyber threats, and enrichment of individuals cybersecurity maturity and awareness. it is highly recommended that cybersecurity university program administrators utilize the proposed gqostrategies to align their programs curriculum to ncsp. hence, closing the gap that exists with the relevant skills and sustain national cybersecurity workforces."
BRINSON2015218,Learning outcome achievement in non-traditional (virtual and remote) versus traditional (hands-on) laboratories: A review of the empirical research,"this review presents the first attempt to synthesize recent (post-2005) empirical studies that focus on directly comparing learning outcome achievement using traditional lab (tl; hands-on) and non-traditional lab (ntl; virtual and remote) participants as experimental groups. findings suggest that most studies reviewed (n 50, 89) demonstrate student learning outcome achievement is equal or higher in ntl versus tl across all learning outcome categories (knowledge and understanding, inquiry skills, practical skills, perception, analytical skills, and social and scientific communication), though the majority of studies (n 53, 95) focused on outcomes related to content knowledge, with most studies (n 40, 71) employing quizzes and tests as the assessment instrument. scientific inquiry skills was the least assessed learning objective (n 4, 7), and lab reportswritten assignments (n 5, 9) and practical exams (n 5, 9) were the least common assessment instrument. the results of this review raise several important concerns and questions to be addressed by future research."
MOHDAMINUDDIN2023103582,The rise of website fingerprinting on Tor: Analysis on techniques and assumptions,"tor is one of the most popular anonymity networks that allows internet users to hide their browsing activity. hiding browsing activity is essential for internet users to increase their privacy. only tor users should know the website they are browsing. however, an attacker can utilise the website fingerprinting (wf) attack to identify webpages browsed by tor users. wf is a significant threat to internet users privacy as tor should conceal the browsed webpages information. existing wf studies focused on the investigation to improve the identification capabilities, overlooking the systematic discussion and assessment of existing techniques. in addition, existing surveys and analyses reviewed insufficient variation of wf on tor techniques. therefore, this survey paper aims to provide a systematic and thorough review of various wf on tor techniques. first, we discuss wf on tor techniques in five primary aspects: threat model, victim target, website realm, traffic feature, and traffic classifier. we analyse and classify the reviewed studies on each wf aspect. the classification facilitates in-depth understanding and comparison between wf on tor techniques. furthermore, this paper investigates nine assumptions exercised in wf on tor: closed-world, sequential browsing, isolated traffic, replicability, traffic parsing, passive webpage, disabled cache, static content, and single webpage. these assumptions limit the wf on tors practicality in real-world scenarios. our analysis and classification indicate that most wf on tor studies apply these assumptions despite being only suitable in controlled environments or laboratory experiments. in addition, most reviewed studies often lack transparency on the assumptions exercised in their studies, risking misunderstanding the wf on tor techniques actual practicality. at the end of this survey, we present wf on tor taxonomy and highlight 21 wf on tor researchs limitations and gaps with plausible recommendations. we also discuss the wf on tor studies contribution category and development phase."

ZEYER2015235,11 - For the mutual benefit: Health information provision in the science classroom,"in this chapter, the authors argue that the school science classroom should help students deal with complex real-life information about health and disease. they also discuss means by which curriculum and instruction in science education can be tied to these issues. the chapter reviews opportunities and challenges presented to individuals by the expectations of participatory health care, focusing on models of health literacy that can help understand and address the challenges. the authors argue that the problem of ensuring effective information use often lies in a transmission approach to health information provision. transmitted knowledge is often not understood nor applied, as demonstrated in studies of human papillomavirus vaccination education. an alternative to knowledge transmission is the approach that aims to foster critical literacy, which is grounded in critical thinking essential to the practice of science. the chapter reviews a number of interdisciplinary science education activities that introduce health issues in the context of biology, physics, and chemistry education, ensuring deep understanding needed for developing critical literacy. it also discusses science education approaches and theories that encourage the development of deep, culturally meaningful science knowledge. finally, the chapter reviews professional development and the role of various professionals, including teachers and librarians, in the collaborative endeavor of effective health information provision."
WAITE2020103838,Difficulties with design: The challenges of teaching design in K-5 programming,"teachers in england are required to ensure that learners from the age of five are taught about algorithms and program design. yet, there is evidence that despite teachers reporting that design is important, they are not converting this into classroom practice. this paper describes a survey study, in which we explored teachers difficulties in using design. we surveyed 207 teachers asking them free-text questions on their use of design in teaching programming and their views of pupils responses to using design. in the survey, we also investigated teachers understanding of the term algorithm, an essential concept which may be a contributing factor in their difficulties with design. we provide underpinning data on the difficulties of using design that teachers of pupils aged from 5 to 11 years old (grades k to 5) have in teaching programming. difficulties with design identified include pupil resistance, a lack of time, a lack of pupil and teacher expertise, conflicting pedagogical choices and a general confusion over what an algorithm is. there were statistically significant differences in selection of the term algorithm to describe programming artefacts whether a teacher was a specialist or a generalist, what training they had received on programming or design, the age group taught and programming language used. teachers were more likely to call a complex code snippet an algorithm than a simpler one and more likely to select the term to describe code snippets than a design artefact. we make suggestions of how to alleviate the problems including that teachers are introduced to the idea of ambiguous representations of algorithms and a process which refines the representation from ambiguous to unambiguous as the design progresses."
AOKI2013310,Propagation & level: Factors influencing in the ICT composite index at the school level,"many nations are greatly affected by their education policies, and the educational level of different schools is relevant to a nations ict policy. in the area of ict, korea has achieved quite high levels of competency. this study analyzed the level of ict competency of 4490 elementary and 2419 middle schools in korea within the context of the korean educational system and social circumstances. the findings are as follows: first, differences in ict level were greater among elementary schools than among middle schools; and secondly, ict usage had a great impact on the ict composite index for both elementary and middle schools. for both elementary and middle schools, the indicators that were found to have the greatest impact on the ict composite index were effort to make use of computers and ict resources and teaching of ict-related subjects. another variable that affected ict competency was the level of ict competency among the teachers and their willingness to use ict in their lessons. this study found that merely the building of an ict infrastructure is not enough to enhance the ict level of schools. in addition to an ict infrastructure the efforts of the teachers and administration were more important than any other factors. the findings of this study might provide useful suggestions to other nations that are endeavoring to enhance the ict levels of their schools."
ADORNI2024100466,Development of algorithmic thinking skills in K-12 education: A comparative study of unplugged and digital assessment instruments,"in the rapidly evolving landscape of digital competencies, the need for a robust and universal method to assess students algorithmic thinking (at) skills has become increasingly pronounced. algorithmic thinking refers to the ability to analyse a problem and develop a step-by-step process to solve it. this research investigates the efficacy of the cross array task (cat) as an assessment tool for at skills within switzerlands compulsory education system. originally conceptualised as an unplugged activity, where students performed the task without digital technologies (e.g., by using gestures on paper) and an administrator manually assessed them, the cat evolved into a digital activity that runs on an ipad. the cats digital transformation has automated the scoring of student responses and data collection, streamlining the assessment processes and facilitating efficient large-scale assessments. it has also enhanced scalability, making the cat suitable for widespread use in educational settings. furthermore, it provides immediate feedback to students and educators, supporting timely interventions and personalised learning experiences. our study aims to comprehensively investigate algorithmic competencies in compulsory education, examining their variations and influencing factors. this research examines key variables, such as age, sex, educational environment and school characteristics (e.g., the level and grade of education), and regional factors (e.g., the canton of the school) in switzerland, and characteristics related to the specific assessment tool, including the type of artefact used, the complexity of the algorithms generated, and the level of autonomy. additionally, it seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the unplugged and digital approaches in assessing at skills, specifically comparing the unplugged and virtual cat versions, aiming to provide insights into their advantages and potential synergies. this investigation delineates the developmental progression of at skills across compulsory education, emphasising the influence of age on algorithm development and problem-solving strategies. furthermore, we reveal the impact of artefacts and the potential of digital tools to facilitate advanced at skill development across diverse age groups. finally, our investigation delves into the influence of school environments and sex disparities on at performance, alongside the significant individual variability influenced by personal abilities and external circumstances. these findings underscore the importance of tailored educational interventions and equitable practices to accommodate diverse learning profiles and optimise student outcomes in at across educational settings."
CANNAVO2020102450,A visual editing tool supporting the production of 3D interactive graphics assets for public exhibitions,"the introduction of interactive assets in public exhibitions is capable to significantly enhance the visitors user experience. however, the creation of interactive applications could represent a challenging task, especially for users lacking computer skills. visual programming languages (vpls) one of the instruments belonging to the broad categories of methods and tools devised to support end-user development (eud) promise to offer an intuitive way to overcome these limitations, by providing easy-to-use and efficient interfaces for encoding applications logic. moving from these considerations, this paper first analyses pros and cons of tools devised so far to support the generation of interactive contents. then, it presents the design of a new tool named visual scene editor (vse), which allows users with little to no programming skills to create 3d interactive applications by combining available assets through an interactive, visual process. both objective and subjective measurements have been collected with both skilled and unskilled users to evaluate the performance of the proposed tool. a comparison with existing solutions shows a reduction in the time required to complete the assigned tasks, of the complexity of the logic created, as well as of the number of errors made, confirming the suitability of the vse for the said purpose."
MCCART2013235,Goal attainment on long tail web sites: An information foraging approach,"the long tail has attracted substantial theoretical as well as practical interest, yet there have been few empirical studies that have explicitly examined the factors that drive online conversions at these sites. this research tests several hypotheses derived from information foraging theory (ift) that pertain to goal achievement on long tail web sites. ift introduced concepts of information patches and information scent to model information seeking behavior of individuals, but has mostly been tested in production rule environments where the theory is used to simulate user behavior. testing ift-driven hypotheses on real data required learning information patches and scents using an inductive approach and in this paper we adapt existing algorithms for these discovery tasks. our results based on clickstream data from forty-seven small business web sites show both the existence of valuable information patches and information scent trails as well as their importance in explaining conversion on these sites. the majority of the hypotheses were supported and we discuss the implications of this for researchers and practitioners."
WEINTROP2019103646,Transitioning from introductory block-based and text-based environments to professional programming languages in high school computer science classrooms,"block-based programming languages are becoming increasingly common in introductory computer science classrooms across the k-12 spectrum. one justification for the use of block-based environments in formal educational settings is the idea that the concepts and practices developed using these introductory tools will prepare learners for future computer science learning opportunities. this view is built on the assumption that the attitudinal and conceptual learning gains made while working in the introductory block-based environments will transfer to conventional text-based programming languages. to test this hypothesis, this paper presents the results of a quasi-experimental classroom study in which programming novices spent five-week using either a block-based or text-based programming environment. after five weeks in the introductory tool, students transitioned to java, a conventional text-based programming language. the study followed students for 10 weeks after the transition. over the course of the 15-week study, attitudinal and conceptual assessments were administered and student-authored programs were collected. conceptual learning, attitudinal shifts, and changes in programming practices were analyzed to evaluate how introductory modality impacted learners as they transitioned to a professional, text-based programming language. the findings from this study build on earlier work that found a difference in performance on content assessments after the introductory portion of the study (weintrop wilensky, 2017a). this paper shows the difference in conceptual learning that emerged after five weeks between the block-based and text-based conditions fades after 10 weeks in java. no differences in programming practices were found between the two conditions while working in java. likewise, differences in attitudinal measures that emerged after working in the introductory environments also faded after 10 weeks in java, resulting in no difference between the conditions after 15 weeks. the contribution of this work is to advance our understanding of the benefits and limits of block-based programming tools in preparing students for future computer science learning. this paper presents the first quasi-experimental study of the transfer of knowledge between block-based and text-based environments in a high school setting. the lack of significant differences between the two introductory programming modalities after learners transition to professional programming languages is discussed along with the implications of these findings for computer science education researchers and educators, as well as for the broader community of researchers studying the role of technology in education."
ROSSON2008468,Design planning by end-user web developers,"we report an exploratory research project that investigates the impacts of different forms of design planning on end users asked to develop a simple interactive web application. end users created their projects (a ride board application) using the click end-user web development tool j. rode, user-centered design of end-user web development tool, ph.d. dissertation, department of computer science, virginia tech, blacksburg, va, usa, 2005. some participants were asked to create a conceptual map to plan their projects and others to write user interaction scenarios; a third group was asked to do whatever they found useful. we describe the planning that each group underwent, how they approached the web development task, and their reactions to the experience afterwards. the overall pattern of results suggests that while the participants who planned using scenarios felt they better understood the web development task, it was the group who created concept maps that explored and incorporated more of the novel programming features of the click tool. we also discuss the role of gender in the click development task, noting that women were less likely to explore the tools novel features and perceived themselves as less successful in the task. we conclude with a discussion of design implications and future work."
HUANG2024152294,Machine learning in energy storage material discovery and performance prediction,"energy storage material is one of the critical materials in modern life. however, due to the difficulty of material development, the existing mainstream batteries still use the materials system developed decades ago. machine learning (ml) is rapidly changing the paradigm of energy storage material discovery and performance prediction due to its ability to solve complex problems efficiently and automatically. various excellent works are constantly emerging in the field of ml assisted or dominated development of energy storage material, such as exploring of new materials, studying of battery performance, investigating of battery aging mechanism. in this paper, we methodically review recent advances in discovery and performance prediction of energy storage materials relying on ml. after a brief introduction to the general workflow of ml, we provide an overview of the current status and dilemmas of ml databases commonly used in energy storage materials. the typical applications and examples of ml to the finding of novel energy storage materials and the performance forecasting of electrode and electrolyte materials. furthermore, we explore the dilemmas that will be faced in the development of applied ml-assisted or dominated energy storage materials and propose a corresponding outlook. this review systematically summarizes the current development of ml-assisted energy storage materials research, which is expected to point the way for its further development."
WANG2017182,Bee and Frog Co-Evolution Algorithm and its application,"in order to obtain better generalization abilities and mitigate the impacts of the best and worst individuals during the process of optimization, this paper suggests bee and frog co-evolution algorithm (abbreviation for bfcea), which combines mnemonic shuffled frog leaping algorithm with cooperation and mutation (abbreviation for msflacm) with improved artificial bee colony (abbreviation for abc). the contrast experimental study about different iteratively updating strategies was acted in bfcea, including strategy of integrating with abc, regeneration of the worst frog and its leaping step. the key techniques focus on the first 10 and the last 10 frogs evolving abc in bfcea, namely, the synchronous renewal strategy for those winner and loser should be applied, after certain g times msflacm-running, so as to avoid trapping local optimum in later stage. the abc evolution process will be called between all memes completing inner iteration and all frogs outer shuffling, the crossover operation is removed from msflacm for its little effect on time-consuming and convergence in this novel algorithm. besides, in abc, the scout bee is generated by cauchy mutating instead at random. the performance of proposed approach is examined by well-known 16 numerical benchmark functions, and obtained results are compared with basic shuffled frog leaping algorithm (abbreviation for sfla), abc and four other variants. the experimental results and related application in cloud resource scheduling show that the proposed algorithm is effective and outperforms other variants, in terms of solution quality and convergence, and the improved variants can obtain a lower degree of unbalanced load and relatively stable scheduling strategy of resources in complicated cloud computing environment."
DIETRICH19943,CHAPTER 1 - Thinking Computers and The Problem of Intentionality,"publisher summary this chapter is an attempt to clear the names of artificial intelligence (ai) and computational cognitive science. these two related disciplines have been accused of a conceptual error so profound that their very existence is jeopardized. sometimes, however, philosophers successfully arrest and lock up the guilty. the best example of this, ironically, is in psychology. artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science are both committed to the claim that computers can think. the former is committed to the claim that human-made computers can think, while computational cognitive science is committed to the view that naturally occurring computers, brains, think. ai is the field dedicated to building intelligent computers. ai ultimately wants a machine that could solve very difficult, novel problems like proving fermats last theorem, correcting the greenhouse effect, or figuring out the fundamental structure of space-time. historically, ai is associated with computer science, but the compleat ai researcher frequently knows a fair amount of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, mathematics, and possibly some other discipline."
PINSKI2024100062,"AI literacy for users – A comprehensive review and future research directions of learning methods, components, and effects","the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (ai) has brought transformative changes to various aspects of human life, leading to an exponential increase in the number of ai users. the broad access and usage of ai enable immense benefits but also give rise to significant challenges. one way for ai users to address these challenges is to develop ai literacy, referring to human proficiency in different subject areas of ai that enable purposeful, efficient, and ethical usage of ai technologies. this study aims to comprehensively understand and structure the research on ai literacy for ai users through a systematic, scoping literature review. therefore, we synthesize the literature, provide a conceptual framework, and develop a research agenda. our review paper holistically assesses the fragmented ai literacy research landscape (68 papers) while critically examining its specificity to different user groups and its distinction from other technology literacies, exposing that research efforts are partly not well integrated. we organize our findings in an overarching conceptual framework structured along the learning methods leading to, the components constituting, and the effects stemming from ai literacy. our research agenda oriented along the developed conceptual framework sheds light on the most promising research opportunities to prepare ai users for an ai-powered future of work and society."
KUGEL1986137,Thinking may be more than computing,"the uncomputable parts of thinking (if there are any) can be studied in much the same spirit that turing (1950) suggested for the study of its computable parts. we can develop precise accounts of cognitive processes that, although they involve more than computing, can still be modelled on the machines we call computers. in this paper, i want to suggest some ways that this might be done, using ideas from the mathematical theory of uncomputability (or recursion theory). and i want to suggest some uses to which the resulting models might be put.

MARKAUSKAITE2022100056,Rethinking the entwinement between artificial intelligence and human learning: What capabilities do learners need for a world with AI?,"the proliferation of ai in many aspects of human lifefrom personal leisure, to collaborative professional work, to global policy decisionsposes a sharp question about how to prepare people for an interconnected, fast-changing world which is increasingly becoming saturated with technological devices and agentic machines. what kinds of capabilities do people need in a world infused with ai how can we conceptualise these capabilities how can we help learners develop them how can we empirically study and assess their development with this paper, we open the discussion by adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. our team of 11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written discussion. engaging in a semi-independent and semi-joint written polylogue, we assembled a pool of ideas of what these capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop them. simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine our hypothetical views. in synthesising these ideas, we propose that there is a need to move beyond ai-centred views of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values."
FREWIN2012209,Chapter 6 - Biocompatibility of SiC for Neurological Applications,"publisher summary this chapter introduces the research that done at the university of south florida to determine the biocompatibility of single-crystal sic and related materials with neuronal and glial cells to determine whether they are possible candidate materials for the construction of a neuronal implantation device. it describes the basics about the cns, how it is organized, and its major cellular constituents are described and their purposes within the cns. following this, it considers the research investigating the in vitro biocompatibility of 3c-sic and a related material, nanocrystalline diamond (ncd), with immortalized neuronal and cns cell lines. the in vitro reaction of primary derived neurons with 3c-sic is also detailed, followed by initial in vivo testing of 3c-sic within the brain of a wild-type mouse. the central nervous system (cns) is composed of the brain and spinal cord. blood is not in direct contact with the extracellular fluid within the cns because of restrictive endothelial cells that create a tight junction known as the bloodbrain barrier. any physical biomedical device that would interact with the cns has to deal with cells that perform functions similar to their leukocyte counterparts found within the bloodstream. the therapeutic utility provided by these devices is that they could be utilized as a platform for drug delivery behind the bloodbrain barrier to specific cns areas, or to transport neuronal factors or even other cells to the cns to assist in the repair of the neural system damaged by trauma and disease."
LAI2021104287,Investigating the impact of a flipped programming course using the DT-CDIO approach,"currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in programming courses. it is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students 21st-century skills. the existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (cook bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. the purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (crawley et al., 2007) a dt-cdio model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. the participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (male 17; female 23). the partial least squares (pls) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. this study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. the results indicated that the dt-cdio pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. the flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. in particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. more importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the dt-cdio approach and other related factors."
PEREZMARIN2020105849,Can computational thinking be improved by using a methodology based on metaphors and scratch to teach computer programming to children?,"computational thinking (ct) is a key skill in the 21st century. however, it is not clear which is the most effective way to acquire and improve ct. big research efforts are made to determine which pedagogical means should be used. one research trend is based on the idea that teaching programming since primary education suffices to improve ct. in our previous work, we proposed and validated a methodology based on metaphors and used of scratch (mecoprog) to teach basic programming concepts to children. it is our hypothesis h that by applying mecoprog, students will develop their ct. to check h, we carried out an experiment with 132 primary education students (912 years in age). at the beginning of the experiment, all students were asked to fill in a programming concepts test and two tests to measure their ct. during the sessions, all students were taught according to mecoprog. finally, they took the three tests again. a significant increase in the results on all the tests has been measured, supporting the use of metaphors and scratch to teach computer programming concepts to primary education students to develop their ct."
BACELO2023101284,Characterising algorithmic thinking: A university study of unplugged activities✰,"algorithmic thinking is a type of thinking that occurs in the context of computational thinking. given its importance in the current educational context, it seems pertinent to deepen into its conceptual and operational understanding for teaching. the exploration of research shows us that there are almost no studies at university level where algorithmic thinking is connected to mathematical thinking, and more importantly, to characterise it and be able to analyse and evaluate it better. the aim of this research is to characterise algorithmic thinking in a university context of the bachelors degree in mathematics by unplugged tasks, offering a model of analysis through categories that establish connections between mathematical and algorithmic working spaces in three dimensions, semiotic, instrumental and discursive. the results confirm the interaction between these dimensions and their predictive value for better programming performance. the study also adds novel considerations related to the role and interaction of mathematical and computational thinking categories involved in algorithmic thinking."
KONG2022104562,Validating a computational thinking concepts test for primary education using item response theory: An analysis of students’ responses,"although instruments for assessing students computational thinking (ct) concepts in primary education have been developed, they have rarely been validated in terms of item response theory (irt). we consider irt to be a rigorous validation tool and apply it to a ct concepts test for primary education involving 13,670 students. a two-parameter logistic model was chosen over other irt models, as it indicated an acceptable model fit and item fit. the discrimination parameters indicated that the instrument could effectively distinguish between students with various ability levels. nominal response modelling in irt was used to retrieve information from the students responses, and those with a lower ability level were found to only consider one of the conditions provided, had no understanding of the repetition structure, and might have difficulties in associating a sprite with its corresponding codes. based on ability estimates, we also found that the students ability in terms of ct concepts increased with grades and that boys generally performed slightly better than girls. these results suggest that the instrument can be used to examine the learning achievements of students in terms of ct concepts."
ROWE2021106707,Assessing implicit computational thinking in Zoombinis puzzle gameplay,"there has been growing interest in assessing computational thinking (ct) across diverse learners beyond the traditional forms of tests and assignments. learning games offer the potential for innovative, stealth assessments of students implicit learning from gameplay behaviors. this paper reports on the measurement of implicit ct practices demonstrated by upper elementary- and middle-school students as they play the ct learning game zoombinis. the process of using the gameplay log data to build valid automated detectors of students implicit ct practices is discussed. findings from this study provide implications for analyzing gameplay behaviors at scale, leading to the development of models for the assessment of implicit stem learning."
KONG2023104707,"Scaling up a teacher development programme for sustainable computational thinking education: TPACK surveys, concept tests and primary school visits","computational thinking (ct) education in k-12 requires extensive teacher development. this research investigates the effectiveness of a scalable and sustainable teacher development programme in promoting ct in primary education. this report presents two studies. study 1 reports on the effectiveness of two 12-h courses using scratch and app inventor programming environments for ct development of teachers respectively, which involved 245 teachers from 47 primary schools. with teaching practices embedded, the programme, which used the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (tpack), significantly enhanced teachers content-related knowledge dimensions. the results indicate that the programme helped teachers develop advanced ct concepts such as data structures and procedures. study 2, using thematic analysis, reports on ct strategies implemented in 47 schools through 94 school visits. the most mentioned strategies were the formation of teaching teams, lesson co-planning, and the integration of ct with subject teaching. the most mentioned challenges were teacher readiness, lesson time, and diversity learners abilities, interests, and approaches. four types of support, including teacher development support, continuous and communal support, teaching materials support, and financial support were identified. the results suggest that a course-based programme with mixed programming environments and embedded teaching experience effectively develops teachers capabilities. however, continuous support for teachers in implementing the initiative after completing the programme is important, especially in addressing learner diversity and integrating ct with subject teaching."
SHAHIN2022111107,How secondary school girls perceive Computational Thinking practices through collaborative programming with the micro:bit,"computational thinking (ct) has been investigated from different perspectives. this research aims to investigate how secondary school girls perceive ct practices the problem-solving practices that students apply while they are engaged in programming when using the micro:bit device in a collaborative setting. this study also explores the collaborative programming process of secondary school girls with the micro:bit device. we conducted mixed-methods research with 203 secondary school girls (in the state of victoria, australia) and 31 mentors attending a girls-only ct program (ozgirlsct program). the girls were grouped into 52 teams and collaboratively developed computational solutions around realistic, important problems to them and their communities. we distributed two surveys (with 193 responses each) to the girls. further, we surveyed the mentors (with 31 responses) who monitored the girls, and collected their observation reports on their teams our study indicates that the girls found debugging the most difficult type of ct practice to apply, while collaborative practices of ct were the easiest. we found that prior coding experience significantly reduced the difficulty level of only one ct practice - debugging. our study also identified six challenges the girls faced and six best practices they adopted when working on their computational solutions."
DEPAULA201839,"Playing Beowulf: Bridging computational thinking, arts and literature through game-making","preparing younger generations to engage meaningfully with digital technology is often seen as one of the goals of 21st century education. jeanettewings seminal work on computational thinking (ct) is an important landmark for this goal: ct represents a way of thinking, a set of problem-solving skills which can be valuable when interacting with digital technologies, and with different fields of knowledge, such as arts and humanities. even if this cross-areas relevance has been celebrated and acknowledged in theoretical research, there has been a lack of practical projects exploring these links between ct and non-stem fields. this research develops these links. we present a specific case a game produced by two 14 years-old boys within playing beowulf, a collaboration with the british librarys young researchers programme, in which students aged 1314 from an inner-london (uk) school have developed games based on their own readings of the anglo-saxon poem beowulf during an after-school club. the game was produced using missionmaker, a software (currently under development at ucl knowledge lab) that allows users to create and code their own first-person 3d games in a simple way, using pre-made 3d assets, such as rooms, props, characters and weapons and a simplified programming language manipulated through drop-down lists. we argue that missionmaker, by simplifying the development process (low floor), can be a means to foster the building of knowledge in both stem (ct) and arts and humanities, building bridges between these two areas inside and outside traditional schooling."

SONG2021106746,"Applying computational analysis of novice learners' computer programming patterns to reveal self-regulated learning, computational thinking, and learning performance","educational research on predicting learners computer programming performance has yielded practical implications that guide task designs in computer education. there have been attempts to investigate learners computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. this approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). in this process-based approach to investigate learners computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. we aimed to identify learners computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, python, in an online coding environment. we examined the relationships between the learners coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners computer programming behaviors. we then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. in our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners learning performance and computational thinking skills. in the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning. recommendations about the use of programming log data analysis methods and future scaffolding for computer programming learners are addressed."
KORKMAZ2017558,A validity and reliability study of the computational thinking scales (CTS),"it is possible to define computational thinking briefly as having the knowledge, skill and attitudes necessary to be able to use the computers in the solution of the life problems for production purposes. in this study, a scale has been developed for the purpose of determining the levels of computational thinking skills (cts) of the students. cts is a five-point likert type scale and consists of 29 items that could be collected under five factors. the study group of this work consists of 726 students educated at the levels of associate degree and undergraduate degree with formal education in amasya university for the first application. for the second application 580 students who were educated in pedagogical formation education via distance education in amasya university. the validity and reliability of the scale have been studied by conducting exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, item distinctiveness analyses, internal consistency coefficients and constancy analyses. as a result of the conducted analyses, it has been concluded that the scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that could measure the computational thinking skills of the students. in addition; the digital age individuals are expected to have the computational thinking skill, and at what degree they have these skills, the revelation of whether the levels they have are sufficient or not are a requirement. within this frame, it could be said that the scale could make significant contributions to the literature."

SHAMIR2022100415,Teaching machine learning in elementary school,"the emergence and ubiquity of artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning (ml) systems have revolutionized daily life. however, scant if any attention has been paid to ml in computing education, which continues to teach rule-based programming. a new, promising research field in education consists of acquainting children with ml to foster this much-needed shift from traditional rule-driven thinking to ml-based data-driven thinking. this article presents the development of computational thinking competencies in 12-year-old students who participated in a learning-by-design or a learning-by-teaching ml course. the results, based on a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the students achievements, indicate that they demonstrated computational thinking competencies at various levels. the learning by design group evidenced greater development in computational skills, whereas the learning by teaching group improved in terms of computational perspective. these findings are discussed with respect to promoting childrens problem-solving competencies within a constructionist approach to ml."
HOU2020100720,Computational thinking training with technology for non-information undergraduates,"technology not only allows us to (co-)create, collect, store, and use knowledge and information, but it also enables us to connect with people and resources all over the world, to collaborate in the creation of knowledge, and to distribute and benefit from knowledge products. in this study, two visual and interactive pedagogies in information technology are used to train non-technical students and evaluate the performance and feedback of students in a programming course in the department of beauty science. computational thinking was integrated into the design and application of the programming subject. at the end of the semester, data were collected from 40 sophomore students in the department of beauty science who answered the technology acceptance model (tam) questionnaire and learning satisfactory questionnaire after the training. an analysis was conducted using basic statistical and correlation methods, and the items demonstrated good reliability for scratch and tableau. the mean of 14 items in the tam questionnaire was above 3.5 for scratch, and that of four items was lower than 3.5 for tableau. the mean of all the items was above 4.40 for the learning satisfactory questionnaire. in the correlation analysis, the variables of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were positively related to the attitude and behavior in scratch and tableau. the use of visual and interactive programming pedagogies enhanced the interest of novice and non-technical students in learning technology. the learners were satisfied with the interactive pedagogies on computational and spatial intelligence."
LEI2020105439,Computational thinking and academic achievement: A meta-analysis among students,"this meta-analysis examines whether greater computational thinking is linked to greater academic achievement among students from 1st graders in primary school to 4th year seniors at university. results from 34 studies showed that computational thinking and academic achievement were positively correlated (0.288). moderator analysis showed that this correlation was (a) stronger among students in eastern cultures than western cultures; (b) strongest among primary school students, less strong among secondary school students, and weakest among undergraduates; (c) stronger among females than males; and (d) strongest when assessing assignment scores; less strong with gpa, course grade, or tests; and weakest with quizzes. neither subject content (e.g., math, science) nor sampling strategy (e.g., randomized, convenience) moderated the link between computational thinking and academic achievement. in sum, the positive link between computational thinking and academic achievement is moderated by culture, grade, achievement indicators, and gender."
ROMANGONZALEZ2017678,Which cognitive abilities underlie computational thinking? Criterion validity of the Computational Thinking Test,"computational thinking (ct) is being located at the focus of educational innovation, as a set of problem-solving skills that must be acquired by the new generations of students to thrive in a digital world full of objects driven by software. however, there is still no consensus on a ct definition or how to measure it. in response, we attempt to address both issues from a psychometric approach. on the one hand, a computational thinking test (ctt) is administered on a sample of 1,251 spanish students from 5th to 10th grade, so its descriptive statistics and reliability are reported in this paper. on the second hand, the criterion validity of the ctt is studied with respect to other standardized psychological tests: the primary mental abilities (pma) battery, and the rp30 problem-solving test. thus, it is intended to provide a new instrument for ct measurement and additionally give evidence of the nature of ct through its associations with key related psychological constructs. results show statistically significant correlations at least moderately intense between ct and: spatial ability (r 0.44), reasoning ability (r 0.44), and problem-solving ability (r 0.67). these results are consistent with recent theoretical proposals linking ct to some components of the cattel-horn-carroll (chc) model of intelligence, and corroborate the conceptualization of ct as a problem-solving ability."
PLOOG2024100653,The intentions of the designers of digital educational tools in early childhood education,"the popularity of programmable robots in early childhood education is growing. such robots are discussed in the literature from the points of view of teachers, parents and children. we add the role of robot designers to this list. focusing on designers and specifically their intentions is beneficial in two settings: in teacher training and whenever using the robots in playing activities in ece. we present a qualitative study on robot designer intentions, conducted by group interviews with designers of two common but significantly different programmable robots, the kubo robot and the rugged robot. using activity theory as the underlying framework for the thematic analysis of the interviews, our data reveal a large overlap of the intentions of both groups. they express the common goal of preparing children for the future although through slightly different competencies: enhancing computational thinking and 21st century skills, respectively. both groups highlight the relevance of subjects outside computer science, specifically beyond coding. our data also show a design process difference the rugged robot was developed with a teacher-oriented approach whereas the kubo robot with an object-oriented approach."
CITTA2019103613,The effects of mental rotation on computational thinking,"although several investigations of spatial reasoning and mental rotation skills have been conducted in research areas linked to stem education, to the best of our knowledge, few of these studies have examined the relationship between spatial reasoning and computational thinking. given this gap in the literature, the present study investigates the role and action of spatial reasoning, and specifically the effects of mental rotation on computational thinking within an embodied and enacted perspective. to achieve this, we carried out a study involving 92 students in five primary-school classes (1st grade - 5th grade). the findings reveal a positive correlation between computational thinking skill and mental rotation ability."
BENVENUTI2023107903,Artificial intelligence and human behavioral development: A perspective on new skills and competences acquisition for the educational context,"despite the significant emphasis placed on incorporating 21st century skills into the educational framework, particularly at the primary level, recent scholarly works indicate considerable variation in the implementation of these skills across different countries and regions, suggesting a demand for further research specifically focusing on primary education. the indications of the digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. in this perspective, education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. the objective in the common european framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of virtual reality (vr) and augmented reality (ar), in the combination of gamification and ai, or the development of intelligent tutoring systems (its) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (specifically: creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, and computational thinking) for the educational context. the analysis carried on, suggests a perspective on how creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving can be effective in promoting computational thinking, and how artificial intelligence (ai) could be an aid instrument to teachers in the fostering of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving in schools and educational contexts."
ALLSOP201930,Assessing computational thinking process using a multiple evaluation approach,"this study explored the ways that the computational thinking (ct) process can be evaluated in a classroom environment. thirty children aged 1011 years, from a primary school in london took part in a game-making project using the scratch and alice 2.4 applications for eight months. for the focus of this specific paper, data from participant observations, informal conversations, problem-solving sheets, semi-structured interviews and childrens completed games were used to make sense of elements of the computational thinking process and approaches to evaluate these elements in a computer game design context. the discussions around what ct consists, highlighted the complex structure of computational thinking and the interaction between the elements of artificial intelligence (ai), computer, cognitive, learning and psychological sciences. this also emphasised the role of metacognition in the computational thinking process. these arguments illustrated that it is not possible to evaluate computational thinking using only programming constructs, as ct process provides opportunities for developing many other skills and concepts. therefore a multiple evaluation approach should be adopted to illustrate the full learning scope of the computational thinking process. using the support of literature review and the findings of the data analysis i proposed a multiple approach evaluation model where computational concepts, metacognitive practices, and learning behaviours were discussed as the main elements of the ct process. additionally, in order to investigate these dimensions within a game-making context, computer game design was also included in this evaluation model."
HOOSHYAR2021106575,An adaptive educational computer game: Effects on students' knowledge and learning attitude in computational thinking,"several studies have reported that adaptivity and personalization in educational computer games facilitate reaching their full educational potential. however, there is little effort to develop adaptive educational computer games for promoting students computational thinking (ct). in this study, an adaptive computer game is introduced, called autothinking, that not only promotes both ct skills and conceptual knowledge, but also provides adaptivity in both game-play and learning processes. to evaluate the possible effects of the game, an experimental study was carried out with 79 students in an elementary school in estonia. autothinking and a conventional technology-enhanced learning approach were used for teaching ct to the experimental and control group, respectively. our results reveal that autothinking improved students ct skills and conceptual knowledge better than the conventional approach. it was also found that students with a low and high level of prior knowledge made higher improvement in knowledge gain using the adaptive game compared to the traditional approach, especially those students with lower prior knowledge. finally, our findings show that the adaptive game could also improve students learning attitude toward ct better than the conventional approach, especially those students with higher prior learning attitudes."
TIKVA2021100849,A systematic mapping study on teaching and learning Computational Thinking through programming in higher education,"computational thinking (ct) through programming in higher education is considered an important skill for students to become problem solvers and thrive in the new digital workplace. despite the wide interest, a systematic map of ct through programming in higher education is still missing. the aim of this study is twofold. first, we aim to provide a systematic map of the relevant research by identifying the areas and sub-areas of ct through programming teaching and learning in higher education. second, we aim to investigate these areas based on two dimensions: their evolution over the years and the branches to which ct is applied. for this purpose, we apply a systematic mapping methodology. main results include the identification of the ct areas of knowledge base, assessment, learning strategies, tools, factors and capacity building. of these, knowledge base, assessment and tools have significantly evolved throughout the years, while capacity building has only recently emerged. in addition, the introduction of ct to undergraduate students and preservice teachers differs mainly in the tools used and the ct elements that are assessed. the study contributes to the field by providing a structured type of research conducted and identifying gaps and opportunities for future research."
ROMANGONZALEZ201847,Can computational talent be detected? Predictive validity of the Computational Thinking Test,"computational thinking (ct) is arising as a set of problem-solving skills that must be acquired by the new generations of students to fully understand and participate in our computer-based world. however, from a psychometric approach, we are still at an early stage regarding the definition and assessment of ct as a psychological variable. one way to advance in this area is to investigate whether computationally talented students (i.e., computational top thinkers) can be detected even before learning to code; and, if so, how to teach them properly to fully develop their high-computational ability. this paper presents several empirical concatenated studies about the predictive validity of the computational thinking test (ctt), which is administered on a sample of 314 middle school spanish students (n314). we report the predictive validity of the ctt, conducted at the beginning of the quarter, with respect to academic performance (informatics, mathematics, and language) and learning analytics in a code.org course collected at the end of the quarter. we also analyze the predictive validity of the ctt to early distinguish between computational regular thinkers and computational top thinkers (i.e., those who spontaneously accelerated from the block-based programming environment of code.org to the text-based one of khan academy). finally, we perform a case study over two of the students categorized as computational top thinkers, in which one of their coding products written in processing javascript is described. our results demonstrate that computationally talented students can be detected in middle school, and that these subjects have the ability to accelerate in the computer science education standards between 1 and 2 years compared to the regular learners. this could have major implications on the emerging computing curricula, which should take into account these individual differences in computational ability and learning-how-to-code speed to ensure an appropriate progression for every student."

ANGELI2020106185,Computational thinking education: Issues and challenges,"computational thinking is a term applied to describe the increasing attention on students knowledge development about designing computational solutions to problems, algorithmic thinking, and coding. it focuses on skills children develop from practicing programming and algorithms, and enables the development of qualities such as abstract thinking, problem solving, pattern recognition, and logical reasoning. contemporary educational and infrastructural developments, like cs for all (https:www.csforall.org), istes standards for students in computational thinking (https:www.iste.orgexploresolutionscomputational-thinking-for-allarticleid152), computer science teachers associations concepts of computational thinking (http:advocate.csteachers.org20140915computational-thinking-and-beyond), and the appearance of tools such as robotics, 3d printing, microprocessors, and intuitive programming languages posit computational thinking as a very promising area to support these learning competences. in this special issue of computers in human behavior, the editors report four studies conducted by interdisciplinary teams. the introduction to the special issue also draws attention to the great potential and need for further research in the area of computational thinking education to engage students in meaningful learning so as to develop useful thinking skills and digital competences. finally, the editorspropose directions for future research and practice in computational thinking education."
SUN2023101340,Does text-based programming improve K-12 students’ CT skills? Evidence from a meta-analysis and synthesis of qualitative data in educational contexts,"promoting computational thinking (ct) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in k-12 education, and the shift from visual to text-based programming is an inevitable trend in programming education. although research on k-12 text-based programming to promote ct skills has been increasing, a literature review that systematically organizes and analyzes it has not yet emerged. moreover, there are no uniform conclusions on how to design text-based programming activities to effectively promote students acquisition of ct skills. the purpose of this study was mainly to determine the effectiveness of using text-based programming to enhance k-12 students ct skills, to explore the effects of various text-based programming instructional design factors on ct skill acquisition, and to discuss the key issues and future development of text programming in the k-12 stage. in this study using the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative method of systematic literature review, 46 studies of text-based programming on k-12 students ct skills were retrieved, of which 19 empirical studies including 37 effects size met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and were therefore used as a meta-analysis. the results showed that text-based programming improved the ct skills of k-12 students overall (hedges g 0.71, 95 ci 0.51, 0.90, p 0.01). no publication bias was detected. in addition, the results of the moderator analysis revealed that: 1) text programming had the greatest impact on computational thinking development in middle school students (g 0.833, p 0.05); 2) the duration of text programming instruction had the most significant positive impact on students ct at 1620 weeks (g 1.038, p 0.05); 3) the moderating effect of different assessment tools on ct skills in text programming instruction the difference was statistically significant, and the test assessment method had a highly significant positive moderating effect on ct skills of students in grades k-12 (g 1.005, p 0.05); 4) the moderating effect of different student sample sizes on students computational thinking development was significantly different, and the implementation of text-based programming instruction had the most significant effect on students ct improvement among students with sample sizes of 41 60 (g 0.921, p 0.05); 5) there were no significant differences in the effects of different text-based programming languages and learning environments on students computational thinking.however, there are still barriers to developing instructional practices for text-based programming to foster ct in k-12 students, such as the highly abstract and complex syntax of text-based programming. this study found that the most critical issues that need to be addressed in current text-based programming to foster ct in k-12 students are the lack of student interest in text-based programming and the misconceptions that arise when students move from visual programming to text-based programming. to address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing student motivation and interest. to address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing students motivation and interest."
SHUTE2017142,Demystifying computational thinking,"this paper examines the growing field of computational thinking (ct) in education. a review of the relevant literature shows a diversity in definitions, interventions, assessments, and models. after synthesizing various approaches used to develop the construct in k-16 settings, we have created the following working definition of ct: the conceptual foundation required to solve problems effectively and efficiently (i.e., algorithmically, with or without the assistance of computers) with solutions that are reusable in different contexts. this definition highlights that ct is primarily a way of thinking and acting, which can be exhibited through the use particular skills, which then can become the basis for performance-based assessments of ct skills. based on the literature, we categorized ct into six main facets: decomposition, abstraction, algorithm design, debugging, iteration, and generalization. this paper shows examples of ct definitions, interventions, assessments, and models across a variety of disciplines, with a call for more extensive research in this area."
BILBAO2021e06135,"Study to find out the perception that first year students in engineering have about the Computational Thinking skills, and to identify possible factors related to the ability of Abstraction","since the end of the 20th century, the digitalization of society, including the educational systems, has been growing exponentially. at the same time, education systems have been evolving towards competency-based assessment. likewise, at the beginning of this century, the idea of computational thinking was resurrected by j. wing, for solving problems and designing systems using concepts of computer science. today, we can see how all these questions are taking shape in a new competence, called computational thinking, related to others that already exist. in this paper, we have studied the skills of computational thinking in university students, focusing on abstraction and its possible relationship with other factors. results conclude that the students fail in relation to abstraction and in algorithmic thinking. although the ability of abstraction is not easy to measure, a linear regression analysis has been carried out in order to determine its possible study."

FAGERLUND2022100511,Fourth grade students’ computational thinking in pair programming with Scratch: A holistic case analysis,"this article explores a new but expanding research topic: primary school students computational thinking (ct) in the context of programming in pairs. the data comprises four fourth-grade student dyads using scratch, a block-based programming tool, for two open-ended creative programming sessions. we sought insight into how the dyads put four intertwined ct dimensions planning; iteration; collaboration, social interactions, and remixing; and debugging into practice. to examine these dimensions, the data was analysed systematically in three overlapping layers: what happens on the computer screen (design events), who uses the computer (computer control), and what kind of talk is occurring (talk). the temporal viewpoint in the multi-layered analysis revealed and enriched holistic understanding of key computational and social factors, such as initial project planning methods, programming tendencies, and pair programming roles that essentially shaped the dyads design processes. next to opportunities for more focal research in ct education, the results provide especially evidence-based pedagogical knowledge for supporting students open-ended programming in the classroom. in particular, concrete suggestions for supporting open-ended project planning, balancing between self-directed design and instructional support during programming, and promoting shared design processes in pair programming are provided based on the findings."
GARCIAPENALVO2018407,Exploring the computational thinking effects in pre-university education,"several countries have usually adopted several priorities for developing ict competences from kindergarten to secondary education. most of them are focused on the development of key competences andor coding skills. although coding may be very attractive for young students and a very good practice or experience, it could be more interesting to develop students logical thinking skills and problem-solving skills throughout programming approaches or computational thinking. this is a very exciting challenge with lots of possibilities regarding coding, robots, mobiles devices, arduino-based application, game-based learning and so on. thus, it is very important to explore the effect that these experiences have been taking into the pre-university students, both at primary and secondary education, with a special focus on the computational thinking as one of the components inside the toolbox to develop a reflexive and critical education in order to help children to solve problems using the technology with which they will live daily."
LAURENT2022101667,Impact of programming on primary mathematics learning,"the aim of this study is to investigate whether a programming activity might serve as a learning vehicle for mathematics acquisition in grades four and five. for this purpose, the effects of a programming activity, an essential component of computational thinking, were evaluated on learning outcomes of three mathematical notions: euclidean division (n 1,880), additive decomposition (n 1,763) and fractions (n 644). classes were randomly assigned to the programming (with scratch) and control conditions. multilevel analyses indicate negative effects (effect size range 0.16 to 0.21) of the programming condition for the three mathematical notions. a potential explanation of these results is the difficulties in the transfer of learning from programming to mathematics."
HSU2018296,How to learn and how to teach computational thinking: Suggestions based on a review of the literature,"computational thinking (ct) is seen as an important competence that is required in order to adapt to the future. however, educators, especially k-12 teachers and researchers, have not clearly identified how to teach it. in this study, a meta-review of the studies published in academic journals from 2006 to 2017 was conducted to analyze application courses, adopted learning strategies, participants, teaching tools, programming languages, and course categories of ct education. from the review results, it was found that the promotion of ct in education has made great progress in the last decade. in addition to the increasing number of ct studies in different countries, the subjects, research issues, and teaching tools have also become more diverse in recent years. it was also found that ct has mainly been applied to the activities of program design and computer science, while some studies are related to other subjects. meanwhile, most of the studies adopted project-based learning, problem-based learning, cooperative learning, and game-based learning in the ct activities. in other words, such activities as aesthetic experience, design-based learning, and storytelling have been relatively less frequently adopted. most of the studies focused on programming skills training and mathematical computing, while some adopted a cross-domain teaching mode to enable students to manage and analyze materials of various domains by computing. in addition, since the cognitive ability of students of different ages varies, the ct ability cultivation methods and content criteria should vary accordingly. moreover, most studies reported the learners ct performance and perspectives, while their information society ability was seldom trained. accordingly, the research trends and potential research issues of ct are proposed as a reference for researchers, instructors, and policy makers."

CARLBORG2019130,The scope of autonomy when teaching computational thinking in primary school,"during the 21st century, there has been an increased interest in the field of computational thinking as a consequence of the ever faster technical development. however, educating future generations in programming and computational thinking is not trivial. many different platforms and teaching approaches can be used for this purpose. inspired by the uk initiative with bbc micro:bit, this paper strives to identify what may be important to consider when designing teaching materials with the bbc micro:bit for training swedish primary school learners computational thinking skills relating to mathematical and technical school subjects. this has been investigated in an iterative process, by conducting 21 workshops with the goal to support primary school teachers in developing bbc micro:bit teaching materials. the contribution of this paper is the scope of autonomy model, which is based on the relation between learning potential, the risk of feeling overwhelmed, and the amount of choices provided in exercises. the model aim to support teachers in developing and appropriating material for teaching programming and computational thinking with individual progression in accordance with the new curriculum."
LYE201451,Review on teaching and learning of computational thinking through programming: What is next for K-12?,"programming is more than just coding, for, it exposes students to computational thinking which involves problem-solving using computer science concepts like abstraction and decomposition. even for non-computing majors, computational thinking is applicable and useful in their daily lives. the three dimensions of computational thinking are computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. in recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in k-12 contexts. through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. from the review, we propose that more k-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. to better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data. as for the instructional implication, it is proposed that a constructionism-based problem-solving learning environment, with information processing, scaffolding and reflection activities, could be designed to foster computational practices and computational perspectives."
HARANGUS2020615,Computational Thinking in Secondary and Higher Education,"one of the most important challenges of education is the formation of proper computational thinking (ct). in line with k-12 computer science framework (k12cs.org) the term of ct refers to the thought processes involved in expressing solutions as computational steps or algorithms that can be carried out by a computer. ct is a problem solving process essential to the development of computer applications, but it is also used in supporting problem solving across many other disciplines. it has gained some grounds in secondary education in the last few years and there are ongoing efforts to introduce it to elementary education as well. taking into consideration that algorithms play a central role in computational thinking, the aim of our research was to assess the skills of secondary school students and university students in this area, ct, that they faced an apparently computer science free task but with obvious algorithmic background. according to the aims of our research there were two target populations: secondary school students and university students. in order to measure the level of computational thinking we elaborated a worksheet (test with problems to be solved). the tasks contained algorithms that can be applied on computer, and they did not need any it knowledge, only structured and logical thinking. the results provide a reliable guide regarding those cognitive skills, among secondary school-children and university students, which need improvement, so transfer of knowledge could work in practical, life-like situations."
HUANG2024100651,Deepening children’s STEM learning through making and creative writing,"current trends demonstrate that researchers and k-12 educators are moving towards integrating computational thinking (ct) concepts outside of the computer science (cs) classroom (lee et al., 2020). however, one of the present challenges includes a lack of engaging learning content and instruction for translating computational concepts that non-cs instructors can bring into their classrooms. our research team developed the grove-blockly platform, a website that employs block-based programming and physical computing elements with simulations to support ct learning and iot practices. we designed a 5-day workshop with the national writing project for students to engage in steam learning through making and creative writing. by examining students learning through the processes and outcomes of making, coding, and creative writing, we aim to better understand how learning occurs at the intersections of making, writing, and computing. the findings show students positive learning outcomes of ct and physical computing from the workshop. mainly, students gained a deeper understanding of iot elements (e.g., sensors, actuators) through the process of making and creative writing. this work provides empirical evidence on how students learn ct and computational practices through making and creative writing. finally, we discuss how the engagement of steam practices supports and empowers students learning of ct and physical computing through the creation of e-crafts by students."
LIN2020101011,Enhancing Computational Thinking Capability of Preschool Children by Game-based Smart Toys,"computational thinking has become an important issue in the field of education. because preschool and kindergarten learners are capable of exercising their cognitive abilities to resolve basic computational logic, this demographic has raised significant interest in studying their learning intentions and behaviors. however, prior research fails to examine the effects of teaching computational logic to kindergarten children. therefore, this study aims to investigate the influences of teaching approaches in guiding preschool children to learn computational logic and programming concepts to enhance their problem-solving skills as well as computational thinking abilities. a novel teaching framework is designed to develop the learners cognitive abilities, which adopts the smart toy game-based learning approach along with a tangible user interface (tui) to enhance childrens learning performance and interests. the proposed teaching approach integrates the game-based learning concepts into the tui system, where the learning processes allow the learners to effectively practice the conceptual knowledge and efficiently advance their problem-solving skills. the results suggest using the developed game-based tui system can increase preschool childrens learning behaviors as well as enhance their learning interests and computational thinking abilities."
MATTHEWS2025100725,Social and curious: Lessons in designing digital manipulatives for young children,"introducing digital literacy (dl), including computational thinking (ct), to young children develops foundational skills in computer science, problem-solving, and critical thinking. however, current digital toys for demonstrating computational thinking strategies are not always designed for early-year environments or specifically for young (preschool) children. digital manipulatives incorporating embedded computation can offer developmentally appropriate tools to introduce foundational programming strategies and dynamic system knowledge before children become developmentally ready for more formalised programming activities. this paper presents an empirical study in a preschool environment with children (aged 35 years) using novel digital manipulatives, embeddables, in child-led free and guided play activities in a preschool (fig. 1). from our analysis of the types of activities the children engaged in, we identified underexplored design features of digital manipulatives that can build early exposure to ct skills through ludic and epistemic play. these are designed-in behaviour, distributed interactivity, conditional and proximal relations between artefacts, and abstracted multisensorial reactions."
MONGEROFFARELLO2025100937,"Supporting teachers, engaging students: A collaborative model for K-12 computing education","although the importance of computational thinking (ct) for children is increasingly recognized, its adoption in computing education curricula in primary schools is limited by several open challenges, including teachers training and curricula development. seeking to systematize a process that enables primary school teachers to teach ct through computing education in primary schools, we present the design, evaluation, and analysis of an introductory coding course for 4th-grade classes in a large italian city, utilizing the scratch platform. the course followed a project-based learning approach, empowering groups of children in designing and implementing simple video games, and explored the adoption of a collaborative strategy through which computing experts, class teachers, and high-school tutors proactively supported the project work. we evaluated and refined the course educational strategies by conducting an observational study and co-designing activities with the involved teachers. then, we derived an educational model that may allow k-12 teachers and experts to collaborate in designing and implementing computing education courses that are engaging, inclusive, and supportive."
WOO2022101193,"Problem solved, but how? An exploratory study into students’ problem solving processes in creative coding tasks","problem solving capabilities have often been reported by teachers as a key benefit from creative coding activities in school-age children. however, few studies to date have defined problem solving, and investigated how it is operationalised in interdisciplinary creative coding tasks. this study aims to build knowledge about students use of computational thinking and computer science concepts for problem solving when coding animated narratives. the research investigated students coding processes using data gathered from audio and device display recordings and semi-structured interviews. results suggest limitations to the use of creative coding tasks if the expectation is to develop computational thinking and systematic problem solving strategies, or learn basic computer science concepts. they revealed that novice students rarely solved coding problems using optimal technically-based strategies despite being given explicit instruction on their use, opting instead to bypass problems by adjusting intended outcomes, or by using low level code translation strategies. results demonstrate that engaging computational thinking or even demonstrating understanding of basic computer science concepts was not a requirement to produce a viable creative coding outcome. this study contributes new understanding of students coding practices when engaged in creative coding tasks in regular, non-specialist classrooms. its findings challenge the commonly-held assumption that coding is a natural vehicle to develop computational thinking and systematic approaches to problem solving. it also questions the learning that results from the non-technical, inefficient and often ineffective problem solving practices students employ during creative coding tasks, that are frequently used by non-specialist teachers in response to curriculum requirements."
KAZIMOGLU20121991,A Serious Game for Developing Computational Thinking and Learning Introductory Computer Programming,"owing to their ease of engagement and motivational nature, especially for younger age groups, games have been omnipresent in education since earliest times. more recently, computer video games have become widely used, particularly in secondary and tertiary education, to impart core knowledge in some subject areas and as an aid to attracting and retaining students. academics have proposed a number of approaches, using games-based learning (gbl), to impart theoretical and applied knowledge, especially in the computer science discipline. our research is concerned with the design of an innovative educational game framework focused on the development of computational thinking (ct) skills, and herein we introduce a serious game, based on our framework, which encourages the development of ct skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. we describe how a limited number of key introductory computer programming concepts have been mapped onto the game-play, and how an equivalent set of skills characterising ct can be acquired through playing the game. a survey response group of 25 students, following computer science and related degree programmes but with very diverse backgrounds and experience, provided initial usability feedback on the game. their feedback confirmed that they found the game enjoyable, and also universally believed that this approach would be beneficial in helping students learn problem-solving skills for introductory computer programming. feedback from this group will be incorporated in a revised version of the game, which will now be subject to rigorous experimental evaluation and analysis, to provide structured empirical evidence in support of our approach."
CETIN201770,Reflective abstraction in computational thinking,"computational thinking has become an increasingly popular notion in k-12 and college level education. although researchers have accepted that abstraction is a central concept in computational thinking, they are quick to disagree on the meaning of it. a focus on reflective abstraction has led to the development of apos theory in mathematics education. this has resulted in many cases of improved student learning in mathematics (arnon et al., 2013). our main aim in this paper is to construct a theoretical bridge between computational thinking and apos theory and show that reflective abstraction can be used in the context of computational thinking."
OUYANG2023104721,"Effect of augmented reality-based virtual educational robotics on programming students’ enjoyment of learning, computational thinking skills, and academic achievement","the use of educational robotics for programming education has been shown to be effective in fostering students computational thinking (ct) skills. however, physical educational robots are expensive, which may limit their wide use in the classroom. this study used augmented reality technology to develop a virtual educational robotic system (ar bot for short), which offers 3d visual learning feedback to strengthen spatial ability, as well as delayed feedback and auto-scoring feedback to promote students deeper ct processes. to examine the impact of ar bot on programming learning, this study used a quasi-experimental design to compare an experimental group of 41 first-year university students who used ar bot and a control group of 34 first-year university students who used scratch. we assessed the impact of the two ct tools on students internal learning processes (enjoyment of learning), ct skills (problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills), and academic achievement. the results showed that students who used ar bot had higher enjoyment of learning, algorithm design skills, and algorithm efficiency skills but not higher problem decomposition skills and academic achievement than students who used scratch. enjoyment of learning led to higher problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills but not academic achievement. problem decomposition and algorithm design skills, but not algorithm efficiency skills, led to academic achievement. the theoretical and practical implications of the proposed tool and other ct tools in programming education are discussed."
LEE201426,CTArcade: Computational thinking with games in school age children,"we believe that children as young as ten can directly benefit from opportunities to engage in computational thinking. one approach to provide these opportunities is to focus on social game play. understanding game play is common across a range of media and ages. children can begin by solving puzzles on paper, continue on game boards, and ultimately complete their solutions on computers. through this process, learners can be guided through increasingly complex algorithmic thinking activities that are built from their tacit knowledge and excitement about game play. this paper describes our approach to teaching computational thinking skills without traditional programmingbut instead by building on childrens existing game playing interest and skills. we built a system called ctarcade, with an initial game (tic-tac-toe), which we evaluated with 18 children aged 1015. the study shows that our particular approach helped young children to better articulate algorithmic thinking patterns, which were tacitly present when they played naturally on paper, but not explicitly apparent to them until they used the ctarcade interface."
BARATE20171334,Fostering Computational Thinking in Primary School through a LEGO®-based Music Notation,"this paper presents a teaching methodology mixing elements from the domains of music and informatics as a key enabling to expose primary school pupils to basic aspects of computational thinking. this methodology is organized in two phases exploiting lego bricks respectively as a physical tool and as a metaphor in order to let participants discover a simple notation encoding several basic concepts of the classical musical notation. the related activities, grounded on active learning theory, challenge groups of students to solve musical encoding problems of increasing difficulty."
SILVIS2022100491,Children caring for robots: Expanding computational thinking frameworks to include a technological ethic of care,"computational thinking (ct) is receiving growing attention in educational contexts, where robot coding toys are becoming a widely available means of teaching and learning early computing. as the field of childcomputer interaction continues to define what it means for young children to think computationally, much is unknown about the affective dimensions of childrens interactions with computers, for example how children care for materials like coding robots and how they establish social responsibility in computational environments. this paper examines these questions in the context of an early childhood coding curriculum designed to support ct in kindergarten. childrens talk and interactions with robots provide insight into how they were learning to care for and maintain robots when they malfunctioned. drawing together feminist perspectives on computing, constructionism, and care, we develop a notion of a technological ethic of care and locate this in childrens early coding experiences. through critical discourse analysis, we present two cases where groups of children interacted with each other, their teachers, and a robot called cubetto, establishing forms of responsibility for technology. we argue that an ethic of care must be part of computational discourses in an era of climate change, where caring for technologies and keeping them in working order is key to sustainable socio-ecological relations."
SHIFLET20121753,Introducing Life Science Doctoral Students in Oz to the Wizardry of Computational Modeling: Introducing Computational Thinking with CellDesigner™,"a five-day, hands-on workshop was held at monash university to introduce doctoral students in the life sciences to computational applications for research. although three software tools were employed (celldesigner, matlab including the parallel computing toolbox, and nimrod), this paper reports on the use of celldesigner in teaching computational thinking and modeling, including system dynamics and regulatory networks. each session included a series of brief orientations to the tool, followed with illustrative, practical projects for participants to implement. from written evaluations and various forms of anecdotal evidence (e.g., oral communications, participation, projectassignment performance), we conclude celldesigner to be a suitable tool for use in such a workshop."
SUN2022104457,Programming attitudes predict computational thinking: Analysis of differences in gender and programming experience,"programming attitude has received increasing attention in programming and computational thinking (ct) education. however, at present, analysis remains scant on the correlation between students programming attitudes and their ct skills, and less attention is paid to the influencing effects of gender and programming experience. this study first validated a newly developed programming attitudes scale (2df 2.308, rmsea 0.073, cfi 0.925, tli 0.912) among 1180 seventh-grade students (1213 years old). it then analyzed the relationship between students programming attitudes and ct skills considering gender differences. students programming attitudes significantly predicted their ct skills. girls have higher ct skills than boys, but their more negative programming attitudes may affect their continued skill development. third, the relationship among programming experience, programming attitudes, and ct skills was discussed among the sample (n 175) with programming experience, revealing that programming attitudes played an intermediary role between programming experience and ct skills. two specific factors of programming experience (first time learning programming and programming learning duration) had differing effects on students programming attitudes and ct skills. for programming attitudes, the grade in which students got started with programming had no effect on their programming attitudes, but programming attitudes rose with increased programming learning time. for ct, students who learned programming starting in second grade possessed the highest ct level. in addition, there is an inverted u-shaped curve between students programming learning duration and ct skills, peaked at the fourth year of programming learning career. implications for promoting junior high school students ct skills and their positive attitudes toward programming are also discussed."
BASOGAIN2018412,Computational Thinking in pre-university Blended Learning classrooms,"this article describes the implementation of various core elements of computational thinking (ct) in the classrooms of schools of latin america and usa in two specific courses: pc-01 and ece130. these courses were designed for students of primary and secondary education, as well as for students of high school as part of a dual enrollment program with a local university. both courses introduce the core concepts and processes of ct aided by the visual programming environments scratch and alice. the courses are facilitated by the classroom teacher with the support of a learning platform. this platform is configured to provide innovative pedagogical strategies based on emerging educational technologies. this article describes the concepts integrated under the term ct, and discusses the benefits of learning environments used to incorporate ct in the classroom. it describes as well the syllabi and assessments of both courses, and analyzes their impact of these courses on the educational institutions, the teachers and the students."
SIMONSMEIER2025102699,The effects of programming interventions in early childhood: A meta-analysis,"while recent meta-analyses confirm the positive effects of programming interventions in school and university students, it is still unclear whether teaching programming in early childhood settings is similarly effective. our meta-analysis clarifies this issue by synthesizing the effects of programming interventions for 3- to 7-year-old children. moreover, we propose and employ a taxonomy for instructional approaches commonly used in programming interventions to systematically analyze the relevance of instructional design. the results from 25 early childhood studies and 82 effect sizes showed a medium overall effect of d 0.73, 95 ci 0.51, 0.96. programming interventions effectively enhanced programming knowledge, computational thinking, mathematics knowledge, and cognitive skills. our findings highlight the effectiveness of unplugged over screen-based activities and interventions, including robotics, over those using other program outputs. the results provide educators with valuable information about instructional methods. the taxonomy can guide researchers and educators in implementing instructional strategies when teaching programming. educational relevance statement the current meta-analysis extends the current understanding of programming interventions by summarizing the existing body of literature on the effectiveness of programming interventions in young children. since there exists a growing interest in teaching programming to young children, the results make a useful contribution to determine its effectiveness and to identify effective instructional characteristics. the found results indicate that programming interventions are indeed significantly effective in early childhood to enhance a variety of outcomes. further, the analyses provide information that allow educators to implement age-appropriate programming interventions in educational settings (e.g., by using unplugged programming activities or including robotics)."
HWU2023433,Chapter 19 - Parallel programming and computational thinking,"this chapter introduces the concept of computational thinking. it first reviews the main goals of parallel programming. it then discusses the thinking process of algorithm selection and problem decomposition. for a given problem the programmer will typically have to select from a variety of algorithms. some of these algorithms achieve different tradeoffs while maintaining the same numerical accuracy. others involve sacrificing some level of accuracy to achieve much more scalable running times. for the selected algorithm, different choices of problem decomposition can result in different levels of interference between threads, parallelism exposed, load imbalance, and other performance considerations during parallel execution. computational thinking skills allow an algorithm designer to work around the roadblocks and reach a good solution."
SUN2021100926,Improving 7th-graders’ computational thinking skills through unplugged programming activities: A study on the influence of multiple factors,"programming is an important way to cultivate students computational thinking (ct) skills, which is the essential ability of students in the 21st century. as one of the mainstream forms of programming education activities, unplugged programming activities are mainly implemented in the early stage of basic education. however, considering the lack of programming experience among chinese junior high schoolers and the uneven distribution of programming education resources, an 8-week quasi-experimental study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of unplugged activities in improving junior high schoolers ct skills, and to identify the influence of multiple factors. a total of 93 7th-graders volunteered to participate in the experiment: 62 students were divided into two experimental groups, which were intervened by unplugged activities to repeat the results reliability, and 31 students were used as the control group without any unplugged programming activities. the results of the intra-group and inter-group comparison show that unplugged programming is a more effective way to improve 7th-graders ct skills. students mathematic performance and previous programming experience had a significant impact on their ct skills, but this impact is not reflected in the process of unplugged programming activities. it can be said that all students can develop their ct skills through unplugged programming activities, regardless of their learning background. in the current context, unplugged programming activities can be used as an effective way for junior high schoolers to improve and develop their ct skills. in addition, this paper also discusses the enlightenment to improve students ct skills."
CHAN2021e07922,Learning number patterns through computational thinking activities: A Rasch model analysis,"despite the increasing presence of computational thinking (ct) in the mathematics context, the connection between ct and mathematics in a practical classroom context is an important area for further research. this study intends to investigate the impact of ct activities in the topic of number patterns on the learning performance of secondary students in singapore. the rasch model analysis was employed to assess differences of ability between students from the experimental group and control group. 106 secondary one students (age 13 years old) from a secondary school in singapore took part in this study. a quasi-experimental non-equivalent groups design was utilized where 70 students were assigned into the experimental group, and 36 students were assigned into the control group. the experimental group was given intervention with ct-infused activities both on- and off-computer, while the control group received no such intervention. both groups were administered the pretest before the intervention and the posttest after the intervention. the data gathered were analyzed using the partial credit version of the rasch model. analysis of pretest and posttest results revealed that the performance of the experimental group was similar to the control group. the findings did not support the hypothesis that integrating ct in lessons can result in improved mathematics learning. however, the drastic improvement was observed in individual students from the experimental group, while there is no obvious or extreme improvement for the students from the control group. this study provides some new empirical evidence and practical contributions to the infusion of ct practices in the mathematics classroom."
RELKIN2021104222,Learning to code and the acquisition of computational thinking by young children,"this longitudinal study examined changes in computational thinking (ct) skills in first and second grade students exposed to a developmentally appropriate coding curriculum. the coding as another language (cal) curriculum spans seven weeks and uses the kibo robot to engage students in learning that integrates programming and literacy concepts. we compared children receiving cal (n 667) to a control group (n 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (no-cal). techcheck, a validated unplugged ct assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure ct. over the course of the study, children who received cal-kibo improved on techcheck (mchange 0.94, p .001) whereas the no-cal group did not change significantly (mchange 0.27, p .07). accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, cal exposure was a significant predictor of post-test ct scores (p .01). improvements in ct measured by techcheck over seven weeks of the cal-kibo curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that cal exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. the ct domains that showed improvement in children who received cal-kibo included algorithms, modularity, and representation. young children who learned to code improved in solving unplugged problems that were not explicitly taught in the coding curriculum. this provides evidence that a developmentally appropriate curriculum for teaching young children to code can accelerate their acquisition of ct skills."
KONG2020106230,Formation of computational identity through computational thinking perspectives development in programming learning: A mediation analysis among primary school students,"this study aimed at investigating whether computational thinking (ct) perspectives can foster computational identity (ci) among primary school students in programming learning from the perspective of situated learning theory. this study conceptualized ct perspectives as a multidimensional construct that comprises (1) ability to connect, (2) ability to question, and (3) ability to express, and ci with four subcomponents including (1) programming affiliation, (2) programming engagement, (3) programming actualization, and (4) programming goal setting. students who received at least 6-month programming training for computational thinking development were invited to participate in this study. results of confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) suggested that the ct perspectives instrument (n 100) and ci instrument (n 241) reached good fit and therefore were validated in the pilot study. in the main study, survey answers (n 215) including ct perspectives and ci were collected. results of structural equation modeling (sem) showed positive relationships between ct perspectives and ci formation among primary school students. mediation results further revealed that ability to question can foster ci formation through ability to express, while ability to connect can directly foster ci formation. implications were discussed at the end of the study."
KONG2018178,"A study of primary school students' interest, collaboration attitude, and programming empowerment in computational thinking education","building on seymour paperts view of empowering students by mastering programming, this study conceptualized programming empowerment as consisting of four components: meaningfulness, impact, creative self-efficacy, and programming self-efficacy. a sample of 287 primary school students in grades four to six completed a corresponding survey. confirmatory factor analysis validated the proposed components of the programming empowerment instrument. a structural equation model indicated that students with greater interest in programming perceived it as more meaningful, had greater impact, had greater creative self-efficacy, and had greater programming self-efficacy. also, students with attitudes toward collaboration that were more positive than others had greater creative self-efficacy. boys showed more interest in programming than girls did. students in higher grade levels than others viewed programming as less meaningful and had lower programming self-efficacy. these results support future studies that evaluate the impacts of interest-driven computational thinking and programming curricula with ample collaboration opportunities."
VOURLETSIS2022100069,Exploring the effect of remixing stories and games on the development of students' computational thinking,"computational thinking (ct) is broadly recognised as a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that enable their computer-mediated representation across a variety of fields. nowadays, it is argued that ct needs to be expanded towards new pathways that establish a less individualistic and more social ct. one of these pathways consists of modifying and sharing versions of projects that other members of the community have created, but few researchers have investigated how it might be applied to primary school pupils. in this study we aimed to address the effect of a ct course on (a) primary school students reusing and remixing proficiency level and (b) the ct concepts they modify while they engage in reusing and remixing scratch projects. forty pairs of participants worked with scratch, a block-based visual programming language, remixing projects related to stories and games. data collection involved semi-structured interviews, a rubric, and an online analytical tool, dr. scratch. the results of the analysis suggest that our instructional intervention, and especially game remixing activities, can improve students reusing and remixing proficiency; however, students modify different ct concepts when they remix stories and games."
ROMANGONZALEZ2018441,Extending the nomological network of computational thinking with non-cognitive factors,"computational thinking (ct) is being consolidated as a key set of problem-solving skills that must be developed by the students to excel in our software-driven society. however, in psychological terms, ct is still a poorly defined construct, given that its nomological network has not been established yet. in a previous paper, we started to address this issue studying the correlations between ct and some fundamental cognitive variables, such as primary mental abilities and problem-solving ability. the current work deepens in the same direction as it aims to extend the nomological network of ct with non-cognitive factors, through the study of the correlations between ct, self-efficacy and the several dimensions from the big five model of human personality: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. to do so, the computational thinking test (ctt) and some additional self-efficacy items are administered on a sample of 1251 spanish students from 5th to 10th grade (n 1251), and the big five questionnaire-children version (bfq-c) is also taken by a subsample from the above (n 99). results show statistically significant correlations between ct and self-efficacy perception relative to ct performance (rs 0.41), in which gender differences in favor of males are found (d 0.42). moreover, results show statistically significant correlations between ct and: openness to experience (r 0.41), extraversion (r 0.30), and conscientiousness (r 0.27). these findings are consistent with the existing literature except for the unexpected correlation between ct and the extraversion factor of personality, which is consequently discussed in detail. overall, our findings corroborate the existence of a non-cognitive side of ct that should be taken into account by educational policies and interventions aimed at fostering ct. as a final contribution, the extended nomological network of ct integrating cognitive and non-cognitive variables is depicted."
SJODAHL2023100573,Abstracting and decomposing in a visual programming environment,"a growing body of research concerned with computational thinking (ct) has emerged the last couple of years, but there is still a lack of consensus about the definition of ct. there are also gaps in the understanding of how young children manifest ct. with this paper, we contribute to the field by taking an action perspective with the ct of k-3 students. the analysis focus on iterative acts of abstraction and decomposition as a core process that elicits development of ct. we call these iterative acts the abstractiondecomposition spiral (ad spiral). by illustrating the ad spiral through the actions of two first grade students, the analysis shows how visual representation of an emerging solution, and the development of a plan are two important elements when young students solve problems in a coding context, developing their ct."
CHEN2017162,Assessing elementary students’ computational thinking in everyday reasoning and robotics programming,"based on a framework of computational thinking (ct) adapted from computer science teacher associations standards, an instrument was developed to assess fifth grade students ct. the items were contextualized in two types of ct application (coding in robotics and reasoning of everyday events). the instrument was administered as a pre and post measure in an elementary school where a new humanoid robotics curriculum was adopted by their fifth grade. results show that the instrument has good psychometric properties and has the potential to reveal student learning challenges and growth in terms of ct."
FANG2025105264,Understanding the gender divide in digital literacy in four European countries: A comprehensive decomposition analysis using unconditional quantile regression,"digital literacy is crucial for adolescents future, yet significant gender divides persist, particularly in computer and information literacy (cil) and computational thinking (ct). this study examines the gender divide in cil and ct among adolescents in four european countries, highlighting the gender-based disparities in digital literacy development. based on icils 2018 data, this research identifies factors contributing to gender divides in cil and ct using regression and decomposition methods. findings indicate that females outperform males in cil, while males excel in ct. gender divides decrease as the percentiles of students proficiency levels increase. the explained portion of the gender divide in cil and ct is consistently smaller than the unexplained portion across countries, suggesting that gender divide or unobserved factors may drive these divides. a comparison of ols regression results with decomposition approaches indicates that the factors influencing digital literacy development differ from those contributing to the gender divide. variation in the factors contributing to gender divides is greater across countries than within countries for both cil and ct. these findings highlight the need to consider national digital environments and socio-cultural contexts in addressing gender divides in digital literacy. this study offers insights for policymakers and educators to address the gender divide in digital literacy."
ATMATZIDOU2016661,Advancing students’ computational thinking skills through educational robotics: A study on age and gender relevant differences,"this work investigates the development of students computational thinking (ct) skills in the context of educational robotics (er) learning activity. the study employs an appropriate ct model for operationalising and exploring students ct skills development in two different age groups (15 and 18 years old) and across gender. 164 students of different education levels (junior high: 89; high vocational: 75) engaged in er learning activities (2 hours per week, 11 weeks totally) and their ct skills were evaluated at different phases during the activity, using different modality (written and oral) assessment tools. the results suggest that: (a) students reach eventually the same level of ct skills development independent of their age and gender, (b) ct skills in most cases need time to fully develop (students scores improve significantly towards the end of the activity), (c) age and gender relevant differences appear when analysing students score in the various specific dimensions of the ct skills model, (d) the modality of the skill assessment instrument may have an impact on students performance, (e) girls appear in many situations to need more training time to reach the same skill level compared to boys."
KONG2020103872,"Teacher development in computational thinking: Design and learning outcomes of programming concepts, practices and pedagogy","the implementation of effective professional development courses for k-12 teachers on computational thinking (ct) in relation to programming remains a challenge. there is a lack of high-quality empirical research on teacher development in ct in relation to programming. this study addressed that situation by providing empirical evidence of the design and evaluation of such a teacher development program in primary schools. seventy-six in-service teachers participated in a program comprising two 39-h courses. one course focused on the fundamental subject knowledge of programming for ct development together with pedagogy. the other focused on the development of advanced knowledge while providing opportunities to practice teaching in the classroom and to reflect on the practice. the results indicate that the participants developed a better understanding of ct concepts and practices and improved in three of the four content knowledge related dimensions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (tpack) across the two courses. the three dimensions were content knowledge of programming for ct development, technological content knowledge of the use of block-based programming environments for programming for ct development, and use of the environment to teach programming for ct development with the appropriate pedagogy in context. analysis of the participants self-reported reflections suggested that the two courses and the teaching experience acquired during the prolonged second course were the two main sources of improvement. this study demonstrates the importance of providing an effective teacher development program with a focus on ct concepts and practices. the program offers teachers a sustained period in which to practice in the classroom and reflect on their teaching while developing their capacity to implement ct in relation to programming."
KASPERSEN2021100302,Towards a model of progression in computational empowerment in education,"in this paper, we present a model for progression in computational empowerment in education. computational empowerment (ce) expands computational thinking (ct) by adding a focus on empowering citizens to critically engage with technology, but currently lacks an articulation of what characterises progression towards ce. through combining aims from computational thinking with computational empowerment, and structure progression using the solo taxonomy, we take the first steps towards a model for understanding and articulating progression in computational empowerment. the model has been applied in the analysis of four ce-focused research projects. based on the analysis, we propose that computational empowerment is a matter of reaching a high competency level regarding computational concepts, computational practices and reflexivity regarding the effect of technology in ones own life and in society. finally, by formulating examples of learning goals, we illustrate how the model can be used by teachers and researchers to articulate, determine and compare ce learning goals, so that learning goals are aligned and complement each other from one stage to the next."
WEI2021104023,The effectiveness of partial pair programming on elementary school students’ Computational Thinking skills and self-efficacy,"computational thinking (ct) skills are becoming essential in all aspects of work and life, and ct has become part of the k-12 curriculum around the world. yet, more research is needed to better understand how to help elementary school students acquire ct skills effectively. the purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of partial pair programming (ppp) on elementary school students ct skills and self-efficacy (se). the study included four 4th grade classes, with a total of 171 students, who were taking the course entitled computational thinking with scratch with the same teacher for one semester. two classes (84 students) were in the experimental group (eg, 44 boys and 40 girls) while two other classes (87 students) were in the control group (cg, 45 boys and 42 girls). the students in the eg were paired up for the programming assignments while the students in the cg did the assignments on their own. the results showed that the students in the eg improved their ct skills and se more significantly than those in the cg group. there was a low correlation between ct and se in the post-test of both groups. the interviews with the teacher and the students afterwards provided insights in understanding the results. the findings suggest that in k-12 programming teachers could use ppp as an effective approach to improve students ct skills, programming se, and beyond."
CESAR2017116,"Introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in interdisciplinary studies","nowadays, many fields of science and engineering are evolving through the joint contribution of complementary fields. computer science, and especially high performance computing, has become a key factor in the development of many research fields, establishing a new paradigm called computational science. researchers and professionals from many different fields require knowledge of high performance computing, including parallel programming, to develop fruitful and efficient work in their particular field. therefore, at universitat autnoma of barcelona (spain), an interdisciplinary master on modeling for science and engineering was started 5 years ago to provide a thorough knowledge of the application of modeling and simulation to graduate students in different fields (mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, geology, etc.). in this masters degree, parallel programming appears as a compulsory subject because it is a key topic for them. the concepts learned in this subject must be applied to real applications. therefore, a complementary subject on applied modeling and simulation has also been included. it is very important to show the students how to analyze their particular problems, think about them from a computational perspective and consider the related performance issues. so, in this paper, the methodology and the experience in introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in this interdisciplinary masters degree are shown. this overall approach has been refined through the masters life, leading to excellent academic results and improving the industry and students appraisal of this programme."
SHARMA201965,Coding games and robots to enhance computational thinking: How collaboration and engagement moderate children’s attitudes?,"collaboration and engagement while coding are vital elements for children, yet very little is known about how childrens engagement and collaboration impact their attitudes toward coding activities. the goal of the study is to investigate how collaboration and engagement moderate childrens attitudes about coding activities. to do so, we designed an study with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day coding activity. we measured their engagement and collaboration during the activity by recording their gaze, and their attitudes in relation to their learning, enjoyment, team-work and intention by post-activity survey instruments. our analysis shows that there is a significant moderating effect of collaboration and engagement on childrens attitudes. in other words, highly engaging and collaborative coding activities significantly moderate childrens attitudes. our findings highlight the importance of designing highly collaborative and engaging coding activities for children and quantifies how those two elements moderate childrens attitudes."

CHEVALIER2022104431,The role of feedback and guidance as intervention methods to foster computational thinking in educational robotics learning activities for primary school,"computational thinking (ct) is considered an emerging competence domain linked to 21st-century competences, and educational robotics (er) is increasingly recognised as a tool to develop ct competences. this is why researchers recommend developing intervention methods adapted to classroom practice and providing explicit guidelines to teachers on integrating er activities. the present study thus addresses this challenge. guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster ct competences in er settings. a between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. a two-step strategy was employed to report students ct competence (their performance and learning process). firstly, the students ct learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students ct scores. results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for ct development in er activities. subject to delayed feedback, students are better at formulating the robot behaviour to be programmed, and, thus, such a strategy reinforces the anticipation process underlying the ct."
KWON2025100253,"Gender disparities in K-12 computer science education: Status, contributing factors, and instructional approaches","this study conducts a systematic review of the literature to investigate gender disparities in k-12 computer science (cs) education. we selected articles published in peer-reviewed journals that focused on both cognitive and affective aspects of computational thinking and cs education at the primary and secondary levels. a total of 29 studies were reviewed, and their findings were synthesized to assess the status of gender disparities, contributing factors, and instructional approaches. the results indicated that gender differences in cognitive and affective dimensions of cs education become more evident as students advance through school, with a greater negative impact on girls. the review identified three interconnected factors contributing to these disparities: socio-cultural influences, educational environments, and individual psychological factors. additionally, the study proposed instructional approaches to address these issues and recommended future research to fill the current gaps in cs education research."
TANG2020103798,Assessing computational thinking: A systematic review of empirical studies,"with the increasing attention to computational thinking (ct) in education, there has been a concomitant rise of needs and interest in investigating how to assess ct skills. this study systematically reviewed how ct has been assessed in the literature. we reviewed 96 journal articles to analyze specific ct assessments from four perspectives: educational context, assessment construct, assessment type, and reliability and validity evidence. our review results indicate that (a) more ct assessments are needed for high school, college students, and teacher professional development programs, (b) most ct assessments focus on students programming or computing skills, (c) traditional tests and performance assessments are often used to assess ct skills, and surveys are used to measure students ct dispositions, and (d) more reliability and validity evidence needs to be collected and reported in future studies. this review identifies current research gaps and future directions to conceptualize and assess ct skills, and the findings are expected to be beneficial for researchers, curriculum designers, and instructors."
ARNEDOMORENO2025100850,Programming Fun(damentals): Using commercial video games to teach basic coding to adult learners,"the acquisition of computational thinking and coding skills is of special significance in helping adult learners keep pace with a new context where those skills are required for many parts of the workforce. however, there is an agreement in the scientific literature that important challenges exist, such as keeping student engagement and the requirement of developing problem-solving skills, and not just learning the code syntax. the inclusion of digital game-based learning (gbl) has shown great potential. to better understand how it can be helpful to adult learners in stem degrees, a study was conducted on the application of two very popular commercial video games in different introductory programming courses at an online university, during the introduction of basic programming topics (cs1). the methods combined a descriptive qualitative and a quantitative approach, using a reflective journals and questionnaires, which helped students consider and express their experiences, how they interacted with the games, how the games helped them better understand the topics, and realize their personal progress and potential. results showed that the use of these games as educational resources had a positive impact in their engagement and sense of self-efficacy, but only if some important instructional considerations are taken into account."
DELOLMOMUNOZ2020103832,Computational thinking through unplugged activities in early years of Primary Education,"the inclusion of computational thinking (ct) in the classroom is something that the present and future society is demanding. however, this domain remains largely unexplored, especially in the first years of primary education. the purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the inclusion of the so-called unplugged activities favours the development of ct in the students of the early years of primary education. to this end, a quasi-experimental study has been carried out to explore the eventual benefit of a mixed approach that combines both unplugged and plugged-in activities. in particular, 84 second-grade students took part in the experiment. three questions were evaluated: the development of their ct skills, their motivation towards the proposed instruction, and the influence of students gender in the two previous areas. the intervention was designed on a selection of activities extracted from code.org courses, and was divided into two phases, one in which one group worked with unplugged activities and the other with plugged-in activities, and a second where both groups worked with plugged-in activities. analysing the three proposed questions through tests performed before, in between and after the instruction, it is concluded that the inclusion of unplugged activities in the instruction seems beneficial taking into account ct, motivation and gender."
ZHAO2019103633,Can playing a video game foster computational thinking skills?,"in this study, we evaluated the cognitive and attitudinal influences of playing a video game, penguin go, designed to target the development of middle school students computational thinking (ct) skills. in addition to the overall effectiveness of the game, we investigated the impact of a specific game featureconstraints on the number of blocks in a solution. results showed that after playing penguin go for less than two hours, students ct skills improved significantly, but the additional constraints did not generate a significant impact on learning. in addition, the game overall did not influence students attitudes toward computer science, but the constraints condition of the game negatively influenced students attitudes toward computer science. implications of the findings and possible directions for future research regarding using these types of games to foster computational thinking skills are discussed."
LUO2020103759,Exploring the evolution of two girls’ conceptions and practices in computational thinking in science,"as the definition of computational thinking (ct) in education continues to evolve, researchers have investigated the integration of ct in k-12 learning contexts and students perceptions and development of ct in these integrated learning experiences. drawing on prior work, this study explored the evolution of two elementary school girls conceptions and practices of ct in science as they participated in a four-week ct-integrated science unit at a summer camp using the dash robot and the blockly app. three ct concepts: loops, sequences, and conditionals, were integrated into a unit on the reproduction cycle of flowerless plants. observations, participant drawings, and analysis of blockly code revealed that the children improved in their ct practices. in addition, the ct-integrated science unit developed for this study successfully engaged both participants, even when one expressed a low interest in science. the study suggested that defining computing vocabulary, using checkpoint activities with immediate and corrective feedback, and scaffolding of coding concepts with unplugged activities were particularly necessary in promoting ct and the integration of ct and science education in an elementary-level informal learning context."
KERT2020100714,"The effect of robotics on six graders’ academic achievement, computational thinking skills and conceptual knowledge levels","this study compared the pedagogical effects of educational robot development and the block-based programming perspectives, which are used in programming education, on middle school students. its participants were 78 sixth graders. considering the students preferences, 38 students were assigned to the experimental group, which studied with robotics (lego ev3) sets, and 40 students were assigned to the control group, which studied with block-based programming environment (scratch). all the topics of the programming unit, which are shown in the methods section, were taught to both groups for 10 weeks using the two different approaches. the change created by the implementation between the groups was tested for academic achievement, computational thinking skill efficacy perceptions, and conceptual knowledge levels. the results indicate that educational robotics develop middle school students academic achievement and computational thinking skill efficacy perceptions more effectively than block-based programming environments. the connections between the concepts of the students who did robotics were also found to be more solid than those who worked with block-based software."
ZHANG2019103607,A systematic review of learning computational thinking through Scratch in K-9,"as computational thinking (ct) is being embraced by educational systems worldwide, researchers and teachers have posed important questions such as what to teach and what can be learned. these questions are universally crucial to the learning of all subjects. nevertheless, there is no up-to-date, systematic overview of ct education for k-9 students that attempt to provide answers to these crucial questions. thus, this systematic review presents a synthesis of 55 empirical studies, providing evidence of the development of computational thinking through programming in scratch, one of the most popular visual block programming languages in schools. the purpose of this review is to systematically examine the ct skills that can be obtained through scratch in k-9 based on empirical evidence. this systematic review has adopted brennan and resnicks (2012) framework as the basis for defining and identifying the expected ct skills in k-9. the major findings entail what computational thinking skills students in k-9 can learn through scratch in relation to the framework mentioned above, taking the progression of learning into account. additional ct skills that are not captured by the framework were identified including inputoutput, reading, interpreting and communicating code, using multimodal media, predictive thinking, and human-computer interaction. these additional ct skills are not currently presented in brennan and resnicks (2012) framework and can be considered as possible supplements to their framework. furthermore, the paper discusses the difficulties regarding assessment and the progression of the identified skills, as well as problems with study designs. finally, the paper sets out suggestions for future studies based on the current research gaps."
ANGELI2020105954,Developing young children's computational thinking with educational robotics: An interaction effect between gender and scaffolding strategy,"the study examined the effects of learning with the bee-bot on young boys and girls computational thinking within the context of two scaffolding techniques. the study reports statistically significant learning gains between the initial and final assessment of childrens computational thinking skills. also, according to the findings, while both boys and girls benefited from the scaffolding techniques, a statistically significant interaction effect was detected between gender and scaffolding strategy showing that boys benefited more from the individualistic, kinesthetic, spatially-oriented, and manipulative-based activity with the cards, while girls benefited more from the collaborative writing activity. in regards to the childrens problem-solving strategies during debugging, the results showed that the majority of them used decomposition as a strategy to deal with the complexity of the task. these results are important, because they show that children at this very young age are able to cope with the complexity of a learning task by decomposing it into a number of subtasks that are easier for them to tackle. the research contributes to the body of knowledge about the teaching of computational thinking. in addition, the study has practical significance for curriculum developers, instructional leaders, and classroom teachers, as they can use the results of this study to design curricula and classroom activities with a focus on the broader set of computational thinking skills, and not only coding."

GUGGEMOS2021104060,On the predictors of computational thinking and its growth at the high-school level,"computational thinking (ct) is a key 21st-century skill. this paper contributes to ct research by investigating ct predictors among upper secondary students in a longitudinal and natural classroom setting. the hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: student characteristics, home environment, and learning opportunities. ct is measured with the computational thinking test (ctt), an established performance test. n 202 high-school students, at three time points over one school year, act as the sample and latent growth curve modeling as the analysis method. ct self-concept, followed by reasoning skills and gender, show the strongest association with the level of ct. computer literacy, followed by duration of computer use and formal learning opportunities during the school year, have the strongest association with ct growth. variables from all three areas seem to be important for predicting either ct level or growth. an explained variance of 70.4 for ct level and 61.2 for ct growth might indicate a good trade-off between the comprehensiveness and parsimony of the conceptual framework. the findings contribute to a better understanding of ct as a construct and have implications for ct instruction, e.g., the role of computer science and motivation in ct learning."

LARKINS2010913,Introductory computational science using MATLAB and image processing,"we describe a new course designed to introduce engineering students to computational thinking. one of the most significant challenges in teaching an introductory-level applied computing course is that students are not expected to have substantial math and science experience. to address this, we have developed exercises which use edge detection and basic image processing to motivate the use of programming matlab in a non-trivial scientific application. matlab is a popular high-level programming language and environment which supports a wide range of computational science applications. matlab has strong support for operating on image data, which allows us to balance solving practical engineering problems with basic core concepts of computer science such as functional abstraction, conditional execution, and iteration."
GU2024825,Enhancing campus OS community engagement through the miniOS pilot class: A nine-year journey,"recognized as the crown jewel of system software, operating system (os) is notoriously challenging to teach and learn, given its abstract concepts, broad scope, and the imperative for hands-on experience. how to cater to the keen interest in os among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience engaging the os community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the minios pilot class initiative. this program allows students enrolled in the os course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the os kernel using minios, our teaching platform. participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to minios, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to minios, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. this hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving minios kernela witness to the collective effort of each class. since its inception in 2015, the minios pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the os community engagement on campus. through this initiative, we have gleaned six key insights and six lessons, which we are eager to share with the broader educational community."
SRIHARI20141083,Role of automation in the examination of handwritten items,"several automation tools have been developed over the years for forensic document examination (fde) of handwritten items. integrating the developed tools into a unified framework is considered and the essential role of the human in the process is discussed. the task framework is developed by considering the approach of computational thinking whose components are abstraction, algorithms, mathematical models and ability to scale. beginning with the human fde procedure expressed in algorithmic form, mathematical and software implementations of individual steps of the algorithm are described. advantages of the framework are discussed, including efficiency (ability to scale to tasks with many handwritten items), reproducibility and validationimprovement of existing manual procedures. it is indicated that as with other expert systems, such as for medical diagnosis, current automation tools are useful only as part of a larger manually intensive procedure. this viewpoint is illustrated with a well-known fde case, concerning the lindbergh kidnapping with a new hypothesis in this case, there are multiple questioned documents, possibility of multiple writers of the same document, determining whether the writing is disguised, known writing is formal while questioned writing is informal, etc. observations are made for future developments, where human examiners provide handwriting characteristics while computational methods provide the necessary statistical analysis."
GENTILE20221,The role of mental rotation in TetrisTM gameplay: An ACT-R computational cognitive model,"the mental rotation ability is an essential spatial reasoning skill in human cognition and has proven to be an essential predictor of mathematical and stem skills, critical and computational thinking. despite its importance, little is known about when and how mental rotation processes are activated in games explicitly targeting spatial reasoning tasks. in particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and tetristm has been analysed several times in the literature. however, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. in this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the tetristm game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an act-r based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. the obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. the study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on tetristm or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness."
FOSTER2018144,Culture and computation: Steps to a Probably Approximately Correct theory of culture,"this paper outlines some provisional steps toward a theory of culture grounded in computational thinking. i begin by describing computational thinking, drawing on marrs hierarchy for the analysis of information processing systems. i then address the definition of culture, arguing that culture is a property of causal chains, rather than a thing-in-the-world. i briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of cultureembodied versus embeddedand argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) handles in the environment. when schemas are objectively adapted to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational. to explain ecologically rational culture-in-action, i outline a formal approach to cultural learning based on probably approximately correct (pac)-learning theory. i illustrate my approach throughout with examples drawn from the sociology of science."
JOHNSON2025101757,"Shifting pedagogically: Incorporating the social, cultural, and emotional dimensions of student learning to develop STEM-identities in computer science","through qualitative inquiry of a 9th-grade computer science (cs) classroom, this paper examines how teachers pedagogical approaches can help prioritize the social and emotional dimensions of student learning to foster stem identity and development. findings from an ethnographic study of the delivery of the exploring computer science curriculum in a high school setting of majority of students of color, and low-income youth identify five high-leverage instructional strategies. these strategies include 1) teacher mindsets towards specific subject areas like computer science; 2) creating conditions for affirming students culturally; 3) intentionally prioritizing student autonomy for social and emotional development; 4) co-constructing knowledge to increase student engagement; and 5) helping students create their own stem identity by exposing them to stem professionals of similar racial and cultural characteristics as students. collectively, these practices offer critical windows into how educators can act as intermediaries in helping students see themselves in the cs field and stemcs career pathways. findings from this study can inform strategies for teacher education and policy efforts seeking to close learning gaps for historically marginalized groups and to improve racial and gender diversity in opportunities for growing stem fields."
BEHERA2024103765,Assessing the intention to adopt computational intelligence in interactive marketing,"interactive marketing (im) can be used by e-commerce businesses to provide interactive and personalised experiences to e-customers by building sustainable relationships and delivering value. computational intelligence (ci) is the ability of a machine to learn specific tasks via data or experimental observation for understanding and analysing customer behavioural patterns. thus, this study explores how e-customers may intend to adopt ci in e-commerce within the boundaries of im. using online surveys, the primary data were collected from 315 e-customers of e-commerce businesses. subsequently, the quantitative approach was used to analyse the data. the finding reveals that using a variety of techniques such as fuzzy logic, learning theory, evolutionary computation, genetic algorithms, and deep learning, ci predicts e-customer behaviour in a changing environment. such a prediction results in desirable impacts, including more successful im campaigns and retention actions. further, ci uses a computational thinking approach, including the specification of the problem, algorithmic expression, solution implementation, and solution evaluation, for the identification and classification of stock-keeping units. this allows e-customers to compare the attributes of similar products."
TAYLOR201999,Grouping matters in computational robotic activities,"this study examines the impact of grouping by gender and group roles on robotics performance, computational thinking skills, and learning motivation towards computer programming. one hundred ninety-one students in fourth and fifth grade completed the project. lego mindstorms ev3 robotics were used to compose and program music in groups of three to four students. the robotics project was completed over the course of fourteen weeks for 1 h each week. gender-structured groups of all female, all male and mixed female and male were randomly assigned in each class. all groups in participating six classrooms were assigned one of three group roles implementation, which were fixed, rotating and no role. this study is significant towards identifying group scaffolds and supports that can produce benefits for all students in robotic activities. results indicated that group roles matter when students are working on collaborative robotics projects. three different implementations of group roles in robotics activities demonstrated an impact on robotics performance scores. gender composition of the group did not impact groups robotics performance. group roles also impacted student computational thinking skills, while gender composition of the group still demonstrated no significant difference. finally, while group roles demonstrated a difference in learning motivation towards computer programming, gender composition demonstrated no difference in learning motivation towards computer programming."
KONSTANTINIDOU2022104424,"Teaching with technology: A large-scale, international, and multilevel study of the roles of teacher and school characteristics","providing high-quality instruction with technology has become more important than ever before. however, the instructional practices and the degree to which key skills, such as digital literacy and computational thinking, are emphasized in classrooms vary considerably between teachers, schools, and countries. the present study was aimed at explaining this variation in the frequency of teaching practices with technology and teachers emphasis on developing students computer and information literacy and computational thinking by key aspects of teacher motivation and expertise, school conditions and priorities, and countries economy and innovation. utilizing large-scale, representative data from the international computer and information literacy study (icils) 2018 (15,015 teachers in 1195 schools in eight countries), we performed multilevel structural equation modeling and regression trees and found that teacher motivation and collaboration were positively and consistently linked to teaching practices across countries. besides, principals expectations concerning the teaching with technology explained variation in finnish and german schools. in three countries, teachers professional development was related to their teaching practices. finally, countries economic development and innovation explained variation in the teacher-level effects. our study sheds new light on the possible factors related to teaching with technology and advances the field by taking a multilevel and international perspective on these factors."

ZHONG2025105230,Evaluating AI literacy of secondary students: Framework and scale development,"k-12 ai education not only equips students with ai literacy but also encourages underrepresented groups to pursue further studies or careers in this field. secondary students were particularly well-suited for comprehensive ai education due to their cognitive characteristics and developmental readiness. while most studies have focused on developing pedagogy, curriculum, and tools for secondary ai education, they have prioritized measuring students learning outcomes over literacy development. referring to the empirical research on secondary ai education as well as piagets epistemology and blooms taxonomy, this study figured out a kat framework that constitutes ai literacy: (1) ai knowledge (ai fundamentals, elements of ai technology, application of ai technology), (2) ai affectivity (ai and human, ai and society), and (3) ai thinking (engineering design thinking, computational thinking). based on this, a 57-item ai literacy scale (ails) was developed, and 56 items were retained after expert judgement. then, a large sample of chinese secondary students was surveyed, resulting in 1392 valid samples, which were randomly divided into two sub-samples: 720 samples were used for item reduction through rasch analysis and exploratory factor analysis; 672 samples were used for model validation and comparison through confirmatory factor analysis. results indicated the ails with three-factor structure of 48 items has a good reliability and validity. moreover, gender differences in ai literacy among secondary students were examined. results indicated that boys had significantly higher ai knowledge than girls, whereas girls had significantly higher ai affectivity than boys. the implications, limitations and future research were also discussed."
LU2023100154,Developing a weather prediction project-based machine learning course in facilitating AI learning among high school students,"the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (ai) technology has changed lifestyles, work patterns, and educational approaches. however, courses that can guide students through the practical applications of ai technology are still scarce in k-12 education. this study aimed to develop a project-based machine learning (ml) course for the implementation of ai technology. the core idea of this course, which focused on the supervised learning of ai ml technology, was designed based on the project of weather prediction. furthermore, data collection and status display were realized using various hardware devices such as arduino and sensors, whereas ml algorithms were implemented in python programming language. a total of 68 eleventh-grade senior high school students from a public school in southern taiwan participated in this study. the main variables included understanding ai concepts, computational thinking (ct), and learning attitude. data were analyzed using quantitative statistics, including descriptive statistics, t-test, and analysis of covariance, supplemented with qualitative data. based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the proposed course on the implementation of ml helps students understand the basic concepts of ai; (2) students demonstrate a significant improvement in ct skills after attending this course; (3) although the students attitude toward learning ai shows no significant change after attending this course, their overall view for it is positive; (4) contrary to their learning attitude, the ct skills among the students with different capabilities of learning ai are significantly dissimilar. overall, the machine-learning implementation course developed in this study can serve as a reference for promoting ai education in the future. however, considering learners prior knowledge in programming, setting up appropriate learning scaffolding for them, and providing them with more examples of the applications of ai in real-life scenarios is still necessary when conducting the course for improving the students attitude toward ai."
DING202319,Mathematics in STEM education,"in this article, we discuss how mathematics can play a role in stem activities in k12 classrooms. from the perspective of content, we argue that mathematics serves as a language tool to help representmodel stem activities and explaininterpret identified solutions. from the perspective of process, we argue that mathematics serves as a thinking tool because mathematical reasoning is at the core of problem solving. in addition, computational thinking is a critical skill for solving problems in complex systems. we conclude our study with three suggestions that help make mathematics more explicit in k12 stem classrooms."
BUCCIARELLI2022100443,The causes of difficulty in children’s creation of informal programs,"we present a theory of the causes of difficulty in childrens creation of informal programs. ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. according to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mabducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. an experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mabducers programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. childrens errors are predictable in both their location and nature. our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking."

PAPAVLASOPOULOU201850,How do you feel about learning to code? Investigating the effect of children’s attitudes towards coding using eye-tracking,"computational thinking and coding for children are attracting increasing attention. there are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. one major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. in this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure childrens learning and activity indicators. the goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand childrens activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between childrens attitudes and their gaze. in this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. we recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. the results showed a significant relation between childrens attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task. therefore, further studies need to be conducted to shed additional light on childrens experience and learning duringcoding."
SNODGRASS20161,Instructional supports for students with disabilities in K-5 computing: Findings from a cross-case analysis,"as computer programming and computational thinking (ct) become more integrated into k-12 instruction, content teachers and special educators need to understand how to provide instructional supports to a wide range of learners, including students with disabilities. this cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. data revealed that students support needs during computing activities were not ct-specific. rather, supports specific to these students needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in ct. although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in ct and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. we present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging k-12 ct pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students. we then offer a list of four implications for practice based on the findings."
PAPAVLASOPOULOU2019415,Exploring children's learning experience in constructionism-based coding activities through design-based research,"over the last few years, the integration of coding activities for children in k-12 education has flourished. in addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. this paper presents a design-based research (dbr) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of dbr. three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 817 years old, using mixed methods. over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). the study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. in this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities."
THEODOROPOULOS2021100335,Augmented Reality and programming education: A systematic review,"in recent years, augmented reality (ar) usage in the learning process has been growing. ar tools and environments lead to a variety of positive outcomes and impacts for educational purposes. similarly, ar is changing the learning process in the computer science (cs) education domain. there are numerous studies that adopt the immersive ar technology in order to improve computational thinking (ct) or programming skills, in several contexts. however, there are not sufficient studies that analyze the meaningful characteristics or the advantages and disadvantages of ar in the field. in order to better understand the impact of ar in programming education we performed a systematic literature review. this review analyzes 31 studies in the field. it explores the evolution of this developing technology, the challenges and issues that ar offers and discusses how this work can benefit student learning and further research."
WOLFENGAGEN2024101183,Building a cognitive system based on process interaction,"according to modern notions, computing is not separable from cognitive modeling and activity. this paper continues the tradition of the uniform approach and proposes a small number of general mechanisms that cope with the main known effects of computing as a science the interaction of objects-as-processes, the interaction of processes with the environment, generalized interaction. as shown, the applicative prestructure (objects-as-processes, application) generates an applicative structure (processes, application, values), which ensures the generation of the result the value of interactions, enabling the process of evaluation. the theory of combinators is used as the main (meta)mathematical means. a diagram mechanism has been developed that implements the emerging applicative computational system of object interaction and reflects the arity of accompanying the induced information processes. the processes are bidirectional in nature, both with a decrease in arity reduction, and with an increase in arity expansion."
KIM2025103508,Playful design for AI Literacy: Creating inclusive learning and assessment opportunities,"artificial intelligence is reshaping human interactions with technology and society at large, yet public awareness of its prevalence remains limited, fostering misconceptions and raising concerns about its potential to perpetuate societal inequities. in this paper, we argue that ai literacy is a foundational skill akin to reading and numeracy, and advocate for its broad integration into educational curricula beyond traditional stem domains. despite various initiatives promoting ai literacy in k-12 education, existing efforts predominantly focus on computational skills, excluding many underrepresented students. the paper proposes inclusive learning opportunities that decouple ai literacy from computational thinking by centering on playful activities. by investigating the implementation of a playful ai curriculum, we provide qualitative evidence that demonstrates how playful design features can offer authentic and engaging learning opportunities, even for students who might face barriers."
ARFE2020103807,The effects of coding on children's planning and inhibition skills,"computational thinking (ct) and the coding element of it are progressively entering in the primary school curriculum worldwide. yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on childrens cognitive development. in a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade childrens gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (efs): planning and response inhibition. one-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard stem, 5 classes) instructional condition. the experimental intervention involved 8 h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the code.org platform. children in the control group were exposed to standard stem instruction. four coding tasks drawn from code.org, two standardized planning tasks (elithorn maze test and tower of london, tol, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (nepsy-ii inhibition subtest and numerical stroop), were used to assess childrens skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). to measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). the results show that practice with coding through code.org not only improved measurably childrens ability to solve coding problems, but also their efs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. such findings add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding, deepening our understanding of the positive implications of introducing computational thinking early in the school curriculum."
VAHLDICK2020100037,A blocks-based serious game to support introductory computer programming in undergraduate education,"blocks-based environments have been used to promote computational thinking (ct) and programming learning mostly in elementary and middle schools. in many countries, like brazil and portugal, isolated initiatives have been launched to promote ct learning, but until now there is no evidence of a widespread use of this type of environments. consequently, it is not common that students that reach higher education nowadays are familiar with ct and programming. this paper presents the development of a serious game to support the learning of basic computer programming. it is a blocks-based environment including also resources that allow the teacher to follow the students progress and customize in-game tasks. four cycles of experiments were conducted, improving both the game and how it was used. based on the results of these experiences, the key contribution of this paper is a set of fourteen findings and recommendations to the creation and use of a game-based approach to support introductory computer programming learning for novices."
MOLINSRUANO2018428,"Phogo: A low cost, free and “maker” revisit to Logo","today it is almost impossible to spend a single day without depending on an information system, a computer or any other form of computation. though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. in 1967, logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic turtle. logo was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. from logo, many followed. scratch and lego mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. we propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind logo by updating it with state of the art technologies. phogo combines python, arduino and 3d printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. the robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. the use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. the open and maker philosophies behind phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. the textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students. in this work we discuss logo and other projects inspired by it, and we also share the methodology and design decisions behind phogo, the results of its application in a workshop and the improvements we are currently developing."
GROUT2014680,Taking Computer Science and Programming into Schools: The Glyndŵr/BCS Turing Project,"2012 and 2013 have been challenging years for computer science (cs) education in the uk. after decades of national neglect, there has been a sudden impetus to reintroduce cs into the 11-16 age school curriculums. immediate obstacles include a generation of children with no cs background and an estimated need for 20,000 new cs teachers - existing uk it teachers being insufficiently qualified and experienced. the computing at school (cas) movement has been instrumental in this quantum transition from an it to computing syllabus, as have the british computer society (bcs), leading uk universities and a number of major international technology companies, including microsoft, google, ibm, british telecom and facebook.this paper discusses the background to this position and the progress being made to address these challenges. it describes, in particular, the work of the bcs-funded glyndwr university turing project in introducing welsh high-school students and staff to high-level programming and computational thinking. the turing project uses an innovative combination of lego nxt mindstorm robots, raspberry pi computers and picoboard hardware together with the robot c and scratch programming platforms. the paper discusses initial objectives and the general approach, describes focused delivery across different age groups and ability ranges and presents results and analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the programme. lessons learnt and future directions are considered in conclusion."
BAYAGA2024100491,Enhancing M Enhancing mathematics problem-solving skills in AI-driven environment: Integrated SEM-neural network approach,"this study explores the nexus of gamification, artificial intelligence (ai), and mathematics cognition. sample size of 71 responded in an intervention using game-based learning (gbl) approach. the purpose of designing the gbl was to enhance computational thinking and mathematical skills. the research employed multigroup partial least squares structural equation modelling (mga-pls-sem) and artificial neural networks (ann) through multilayer perceptron (mlp) as data analysis technique. the findings showed significant positive influence on class engagement, attitudes toward mathematics, as well as student performance. the analysis also revealed gender-related variations, which affirmed the models consistency across diverse groups. the study validated the hypothesis and consequently advocated for the transformative potential of gamification, in preparation of 21st-century learners for ai-driven digital landscape. the implications are to ensure the integration of gamified elements into educational strategies, benefiting educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers resonating strongly for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers."
ANDERSEN2024100697,Infrastructuring digital literacy in K-12 education: A national case study,"while much cci research has dealt with the educational challenge of providing children with knowledge and skills for a digital society, little work has dealt with the strategic challenge of developing and implementing a digital literacy subject in k-12 education. in this paper, we explore how to develop, implement, and sustain a national program on technology comprehension by analyzing the newly established danish knowledge center for digital technology comprehension. we draw on the concept of infrastructuring to shed light on how to create and sustain the social, material, political and organizational structures that form the basis for introducing the new national initiative. based on our case, we distill seven propositions that describe more generally how to work strategically with this challenge."
WINTER20181,The art of the Wunderlich cube and the development of spatial abilities,"this paper advocates for a future where the teaching of math and art are harmoniously intertwined as they were in the days of da vinci. in this future, code provides the brush that enables the expression of artistic ideas and mathematical structures in digital and digitally-fabricated mediums. this educational idea is motivated by (1) literature supporting the position that visual thinking and spatial reasoning significantly impact steam disciplines, and (2) piagets theory of cognitive development in which children, in the concrete operational stage, solve problems relating to physical objects (i.e., they learn-by-making). a project is then described involving the creation of a 3d artifact we call a wunderlich cube a mathematical artifact that embodies numerous spatial reasoning puzzles. an understanding of the properties of the wunderlich cube is developed through manual construction using lego, mathematical analysis, computational thinking, coding, and 3d printing."
HENRIQUE2023100546,Who creates our computational worlds? A review of Critically Conscious Computing: Methods for secondary education,"despite growing attention to the social and ethical dimensions of computer science (cs), few practical resources exist to teach and learn cs through the lens of social responsibility. in critically conscious computing, ko and colleagues provide a comprehensive overview of foundational computing concepts with a sharp and needed critical perspective. in this review, we attend not only to the content of the book, but also to its format as a free, online, living text. the book is commendable for its tight integration of technical and socio-critical aspects of computing, approachable conversational style, and collection of flexible and practical resources for teachers. it would benefit from refinement of the integration chapters and a more explicit model for how educators themselves can approach new or different cs concepts through a critical frame. overall, we strongly recommend this book for cs educators at all levels for its balance of depth and practicality."
LANDAU2024101463,Young children’s copying of block constructions: Significant constraints in a highly complex task,"block construction is ubiquitous in early development, yet is surprisingly complex, involving step-by-step sequenced actions to create specific structures. here, we use novel analytic methods to characterize these action sequences in detail, including which individual parts of the structure (states) are built and how these structures are combined, creating a fully specified build path towards the final structure. we find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. the individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths. our approach serves as a lens into the cognitive processes underlying block building and suggests that childrens building is guided by significant cognitive constraints consistent with computational thinking."
ZHONG2016423,The impact of social factors on pair programming in a primary school,"pair programming (pp) is a usefulness approach to fostering computational thinking (ct) for young students. however, there are many factors to impact the effectiveness of pp. among all factors, the social factors are often ignored by researchers. therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of two social factors (gender and partnership) on pp in a primary school setting. to that end, we conducted pp experiments in four classes from the sixth grade in a chinese primary school. the research results indicated: (a) there was no significant difference on compatibility among the gender pairs, but a significant difference among partnership pairs; (b) there was no significant difference on programming achievement and confidence among different pairs, and girls became more productive and confidence in pp; and (c) pp tightened up the partnership within pairs. these findings suggest that teachers should take partnership into account as an important factor in pp or other collaborative learning, and adopt pp as an effective approach to decrease the gender gap in programming courses, and make students socialize."
SAEZLOPEZ2016129,Visual programming languages integrated across the curriculum in elementary school: A two year case study using “Scratch” in five schools,"several authors and studies highlight the benefits of the integration of computer science into k-12 education. applications such as scratch have been demonstrated to be effective in educational environments. the aim of this study is to assess the use of a visual programming language using scratch in classroom practice, analyzing the outcomes and attitudes of 107 primary school students from 5th to 6th grade in five different schools in spain. the intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. the computational concepts and computational practices dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. the learning processes and coding in primary education dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. in this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, project based learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a visual programming language from active methodologies in primary education. due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a visual programming language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in primary education through a cross-curricular implementation."
STUPURIENE2024104939,Teachers’ perceptions of the barriers and drivers for the integration of Informatics in primary education,"a growing trend of integrating and teaching informatics and computational thinking (ct) skills at primary education levels poses different challenges for teachers. research demonstrates that it is challenging to introduce informatics in schools without well-prepared teachers. in this paper, we examine lithuanian teachers perceptions of the barriers and drivers to integrate the renewed informatics curricula in primary education and the relation between them. fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary school teachers, and a mixed-methods approach was employed to analyze them. the results show that explicit guidelines for renewed curricula and motivation to learn informatics are both identified as the main barriers and drivers for integrating informatics. the study further highlights the critical role of resources, appropriate tools, and guidelines in facilitating the successful implementation of informatics. the study provides knowledge that could, for instance, benefit teacher training programmes and help better understand how teachers can be better supported to meet current and future challenges."
EGBERT2021104173,“It's a chance to make mistakes”: Processes and outcomes of coding in 2nd grade classrooms,"several gaps exist in the literature on coding. first, little exploration has focused on early elementary school students. in addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. in this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms."
ARBELAEZOSSA2023102458,A smarter perspective: Learning with and from AI-cases,"artificial intelligence (ai) has only partially (or not at all) been integrated into medical education, leading to growing concerns regarding how to train healthcare practitioners to handle the changes brought about by the introduction of ai. programming lessons and other technical information into healthcare curricula has been proposed as a solution to support healthcare personnel in using ai or other future technology. however, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with ai in the direct application area. therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where ai is currently used in clinical practice as examples. this approach will support students understanding of technical aspects. case-based learning with ai as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the ai suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of ai and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. the proposed knowledge shift from ai as a technical focus to ai as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs. technical education does not need to compete with other essential clinical skills as it could serve as a basis for supporting them, which leads to better medical education and practice, ultimately benefiting patients."
SALEEM2024100124,Understanding 21st century skills needed in response to industry 4.0: Exploring scholarly insights using bibliometric analysis,"international policy agendas are increasingly focusing on the 21st century skills needed by future workers in response to industry 4.0. in this study, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of 2662 articles published by 6579 authors in the last two decades to understand the structure of the scholarly knowledge in this field. we first identify influential articles, documents, journals and trends in this literature. we use co-citation analysis to identify foundational themes in the development of 21st century skills literature, then using bibliometric coupling, we identify communities in the current research front. we then use co-word analysis to identify future directions in the field. overall, we find that research on 21st century skills has grown exponentially in the past two decades, however, few researchers focus primarily on this topic. the existing research is primarily dominated by psychologists, education researchers and technology researchers. we also find that specific disciplines such as industrial engineering and nursing are prominent contributors in the field, and that critical thinking and computational thinking are key areas of focus."
BUCKINGHAM20141403,Computational Science for Undergraduate Biologists via QUT.Bio.Excel,"molecular biology is a scientific discipline which has changed fundamentally in character over the past decade to rely on large scale datasets public and locally generated - and their computational analysis and annotation. undergraduate education of biologists must increasingly couple this domain context with a data-driven computational scientific method. yet modern programming and scripting languages and rich computational environments such as r and matlab present significant barriers to those with limited exposure to computer science, and may require substantial tutorial assistance over an extended period if progress is to be made. in this paper we report our experience of undergraduate bioinformatics education using the familiar, ubiquitous spreadsheet environment of microsoft excel. we describe a configurable extension called qut.bio.excel, a custom ribbon, supporting a rich set of data sources, external tools and interactive processing within the spreadsheet, and a range of problems to demonstrate its utility and success in addressing the needs of students over their studies."
PAPAVLASOPOULOU2020105939,Coding activities for children: Coupling eye-tracking with qualitative data to investigate gender differences,"computational thinking and coding are becoming an integral part of k-12 education, with female students being underrepresented in such subjects. the proliferation of technological tools and programming environments offers the opportunity for creative coding activities for children and increases the need for appropriate instructional practices. in this study, we design and evaluate a coding workshop for children. our goal is to examine differences between boys and girls using eye-tracking as an objective measure and triangulating the findings with qualitative data coming from childrens interviews. the results show no statistically significant difference between female and male gaze and learning gain during the coding activity; interestingly, the qualitative data show differences in the strategies and implemented practices during coding, and in perceptions about those coding activities. our results highlight that further studies need to utilize objective measures and unveil necessary differences in the design and implementation of coding activities. furthermore, our results provide objective evidence that female students do not lack in competences compared to boys, but simply that they have a different approach during coding activities and different perspectives about coding, an approach that needs to be cultivated and nurtured."
ZHA2022104623,A mixed-method cluster analysis of physical computing and robotics integration in middle-grade math lesson plans,"this study analyzed 281 lesson plans collected from the producers websites of 12 educational physical computing and robotics (epcr) devices. we extracted and coded five variables from each lesson. they were epcr functionality, coding skills, computational thinking skills, math knowledge, and activity design. first, a two-step cluster analysis was administered to find how three epcr-related knowledge: epcr functionality, coding skills, and computational thinking skills, were integrated to teach students epcr technology in middle-grade math lessons. results showed three types of lesson plans, including lessons to use basic epcr functionality to teach students lower-level ct skills, lessons to teach students basic to intermediate coding skills, and lessons to use the technology at the advanced level. next, we applied the technological pedagogical content knowledge (tpack) framework and conducted a second two-step cluster analysis to identify how the technology (epcr technology), content (math knowledge), and pedagogy (activity design) were integrated into those lesson plans. results suggested ten clusters of lesson plans with distinct features. we summarized those ten lesson clusters into five categories: 1) epcr technology lessons, 2) transdisciplinary problem-based learning lessons, 3) technology-assisted lessons, 4) lessons without real-world connections, and 5) lessons integrating middle-grade math learning into epcr projects. implications for educators and researchers were discussed at the end of the article."
SCHERER2020106349,A meta-analysis of teaching and learning computer programming: Effective instructional approaches and conditions,"this meta-analysis maps the evidence on the effectiveness of instructional approaches and conditions for learning computer programming under three study conditions: (a) studies focusing on the effectiveness of programming interventions per se, (b) studies focusing on the effectiveness of visualization and physicality, and (c) studies focusing on the effectiveness of dominant instructional approaches. utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (hedges g 0.81, 95 ci 0.42, 1.21), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g 0.44, 95 ci 0.29, 0.58) and physicality interventions (g 0.72, 95 ci 0.23, 1.21), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (gs 0.491.02). moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditionshowever, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through scratch were especially effective. our meta-analysis synthesizes the existing research evidence on the effectiveness of computer programming instruction and, ultimately, provides references with which the effects of future studies could be compared."
LECORCHICK2020655,Problem Solving Archetype - Computer Science,"problems that are carefully formulated lead students to develop more sufficient and realistic solutions. by front-loading the process of problem solving through problem formulation, students are able to reduce the amount of time spent on solution development, and thus increase their efficiency towards meeting their main objective. by teaching students problem formulation, especially in computer science related activities, foundational skills in computational thinking are introduced, used, and refined. using a problem solving archetype as a means for this formulation is an effective tool for students to leverage. as computational thinking skills are honed, these concepts can translate across barriers into other content areas."
ZHAO2015194,Bring CS2013 Recommendations into c Programming Course,"computer science curriculum 2013 has become the guidance of computing education since it was released in 2013by the acmieee-computer society. this paper analyzes the cs curriculum development trend, trying to dig the programming-related core from cs2013 with respect to the knowledge areas, topics, organization of teaching, and the building of students capability. considering the characteristic of our local institution and undergraduates, we present an updated teaching curriculum and lab curriculum for c programming language course in relation to cs2013 recommendations, which highlight the development of the students abilities on programming, problem-solving, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking. finally, we present and assess the implementation of the resulting curriculum."
MARTINRAMOS201751,First exposure to Arduino through peer-coaching: Impact on students' attitudes towards programming,"in this paper we report the work that jeknowledge (jnior empresa da faculdade de cincias e tecnologias da universidade de coimbra), a student-led initiative, has done in the jeknowledge academy courses to actively engage portuguese high-school students in stem education through hands-on projects based on the low-cost arduino platform. f2f activities, based on a peer-assisted learning strategy, were complemented with tutorials and more advanced project suggestions in a blog. pre and post surveys on students attitudes towards programming and peer-coaching were administered to pre-university and first year college participants, finding an overall increase in the likert scale for all the programming-related constructs under study (confidence, interest, gender, usefulness and professional) after the introductory course. as regards the peer-based learning approach, younger students seemed to be more eager to be taught in a less formal way than their older counterparts. the course resulted in high degrees of satisfaction for both the student tutors and their tutees."
POLLAROLO2024100637,"Play with Coding Toys in Early Childhood Education and Care: Teachers’ Pedagogical Strategies, Views and Impact on Children's Development. A Systematic Literature Review","this paper presents a systematic literature review that aims to portray an overview of pedagogical strategies that early childhood education and care (ecec) teachers adopt to support childrens play with coding toys. in addition, the article synthesizes findings about teachers views in relation to the use of coding toys in ecec and describes the outputs that the existing literature identifies as childrens development after play activities with coding toys. the systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the prisma-2020 statement, and the initial search across four databases (eric, scopus, web of science, and academic research ultimate) for papers published between january 2010 and may 2022 yielded 2672 peer-reviewed articles. following the first evaluation, the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in a shortlist of 22 papers. the results show different strategies that the teachers can use during play activities with coding toys, assuming the roles of facilitators and mediators through collaborative work, allowing children to try and fail. moreover, the results revealed that ecec teachers largely hold positive and constructive attitudes towards the use of coding toys. findings also highlight positive outcomes regarding childrens development across various cognitive and socio-emotional skills such as problem solving, computational thinking and communication. as an improvement, future studies should focus on identifying appropriate pedagogies that may be applied in tandem with the technology to maximise the pedagogical benefits for the children as well as adequate training for teachers."
BOCZAR2025102564,Refining nascent interventions through emergent design evaluation,"evaluating nascent educational interventions requires a specific kind of evaluation theory. this paper provides a case example of the emergent design evaluation approach, one theory created for use with developing interventions, but that has limited examples within published literature for practitioners to learn from. the emergent design evaluation theory was used to evaluate the design and implementation of a high school biology unit integrating computational thinking and neural engineering, including teacher professional development and a web-based application. a contribution of this paper, beyond the case example it provides, is that the emergent design evaluation was combined with design-based research, a complementary approach. consistent with the practices uniquely characteristic of emergent design evaluation, this paper describes critical points or key occasions in which aspects of the intervention influence the evaluation process, or vice versa, including the nature and direction of influence. by demonstrating the process of combining emergent design evaluation and design-based research, this paper adds to discussions within the field about how to intentionally weave together different knowledge generation approaches that both meet evaluation demands and align with the evaluation context."
KOCAK2021100967,The mediating role of critical thinking and cooperativity in the 21st century skills of higher education students,"this study investigates whether cooperativity and critical thinking mediate the relationship between other 21st century skills (algorithmic thinking, creativity, digital literacy, and effective communication) and problem-solving. structural equation modelling (sem) analysis was used to determine the mediating relationship between 21st century skills. the study participants were 714 undergraduate students from various regions of turkey selected through purposive sampling and who participated on a voluntary basis. computational thinking, effective communication, and digital literacy scales were used and a significant correlation was found between all the 21st century skills. a series of structural equation models were tested. the final model suggests that, in line with predictions, critical thinking mediates the relationship between the 21st century skills of cooperativity, digital literacy, creativity, algorithmic thinking, and problem solving. however, somewhat different from predictions is the finding that communication skills directly predict problem solving without further mediation. thus, overall, the findings indicate that critical thinking has a crucial mediating role between other 21st century skills and problem solving."
IOANNIDOU2009236,AgentCubes: Incremental 3D end-user development,"3d game development can be an enticing way to attract k-12 students to computer science, but designing and programming 3d games is far from trivial. students need to achieve a certain level of 3d fluency in modeling, animation, and programming to be able to create compelling 3d content. the combination of innovative end-user development tools and standards-based curriculum that promotes it fluency by shifting the pedagogical focus from programming to design, can address motivational aspects without sacrificing principled educational goals. the agentcubes 3d game-authoring environment raises the ceiling of end-user development without raising the threshold. our formal user study shows that with incremental 3d, the gradual approach to transition from 2d to 3d authoring, middle school students can build sophisticated 3d games including 3d models, animations, and programming."
MARUYAMA20181037,Investigation into Parents’ Concerns about the Introduction of Programming Education into Japanese Primary School,"the introduction of computational thinking into primarysecondary or k-12 education has been widely attempted. in japan, programming education will be introduced into primary school in 2020. the role of parents in primary education is highly important, and their attitude towards education has a considerable influence on childrens attitudes. to investigate parents concerns regarding programming education in primary school, a preliminary questionnaire survey has been conducted as a first step of the study."

GUTIERREZBELTRAN2025103198,Mi Superpoder es la Programación: A tool for teaching programming to children and youth,"mi superpoder es la programacin is a web tool designed to teach programming to children and young people. it focuses on developing logical thinking through interactive exercises that cover computer parts recognition, sequences, patterns, and flowcharts. the tool was developed to address the educational needs identified in the social project of the same name, where modern technologies and a serverless-based architecture were used to create an accessible and effective solution for teaching programming. initial results indicate that students found the tool useful and demonstrated improvements in their understanding of computational logic. this analysis is framed within the global challenge of teaching programming to children and youth, demonstrating the potential of gamified tools across diverse educational contexts. future plans include expanding the tool to incorporate more modules, allowing customization by teachers, and conducting broader evaluations in different educational environments."
FLANIGAN2017179,Implicit intelligence beliefs of computer science students: Exploring change across the semester,"this study investigated introductory computer science (cs1) students implicit beliefs of intelligence. referencing dweck and leggetts (1988) framework for implicit beliefs of intelligence, we examined how (1) students implicit beliefs changed over the course of a semester, (2) these changes differed as a function of course enrollment and students motivated self-regulated engagement profile, and (3) implicit beliefs predicted student learning based on standardized course grades and performance on a computational thinking knowledge test. for all students, there were significant increases in entity beliefs and significant decreases in incremental beliefs across the semester. however, examination of effect sizes suggests that significant findings for change across time were driven by changes in specific subpopulations of students. moreover, results showed that students endorsed incremental belief more strongly than entity belief at both the beginning and end of the semester. furthermore, the magnitude of changes differed based on students motivated self-regulated engagement profiles. additionally, students achievement outcomes were weakly predicted by their implicit beliefs of intelligence. finally, results showed that the relationship between changes in implicit intelligence beliefs and student achievement varied across different cs1 courses. theoretical implications for implicit intelligence beliefs and recommendations for stem educators are discussed."
OCAK2023100146,An AI-enhanced pattern recognition approach to temporal and spatial analysis of children's embodied interactions,"multimodal video analysis is a complex and time-consuming process for a researcher; it entails capturing, watching, and re-watching video data to identify which segments best inform or address the questions that drive the research. modern ai applications can alleviate the challenges that arise during the fine-grained analysis of learners multimodal interactions captured through video. in this study, we present a supervised approach to training a deep neural network to analyze childrens computational thinking (ct) captured through multimodal video data. the approach first uses a set of images extracted from video data to train the ai to map them to labels generated using a priori theory. confusion matrices were used to establish the performance of the ai by comparing ai predictions to human analysis on a validation set of data. the findings suggested that the ai classified several aspects of childrens ct in a way that was highly consistent with human analysis, demonstrating how the ai could serve as an additional team member during multimodal analysis. implications for using ai to ease the challenges of multimodal analysis of video data are discussed."
KHANMOHAMMADI2024104660,Comparative multi-objective optimization using neural networks for ejector refrigeration systems with LiBr and LiCl working agents,"educations evolution in the context of energy systems is essential for addressing sustainable energy challenges and developing a workforce equipped for future innovations, emphasizing both formal curricula and informal lifelong learning through successful energy case studies. as the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar-powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. the studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. the present works main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two-objective optimization were extracted. parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed systems performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. in addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. to find the best values of decision variables, multi-objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. the results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 h). the outcomes of this work can play a critical role for higher education institutions in advancing innovative solutions to pressing energy challenges. lifelong learning, at the heart of educational innovation, can benefit from the integration of sustainable energy systems as a core component of informal education through the optimization of ejector refrigeration systems."

DIAGO2022100388,Exploring the development of mental rotation and computational skills in elementary students through educational robotics,"interest in educational robotics has increased over the last decade. through various approaches, robots are being used in the teaching and learning of different subjects at distinct education levels. the present study investigates the effects of an educational robotic intervention on the mental rotation and computational thinking assessment in a 3rd grade classroom. to this end, we carried out a quasi-experimental study involving 24 third-grade students. from an embodied approach, we have designed a two-hour intervention providing students with a physical environment to perform tangible programming on bee-bot. the results revealed that this educational robotic proposal aimed at map-reading tasks leads to statistically significant gains in computational thinking. moreover, students who followed the bee-bot-based intervention achieved greater ct level compared to students following a traditional instruction approach, after controlling students prior level. no conclusive results were found in relation to mental rotation."
YU201917,A review of computational toys and kits for young children,"this paper presents a review of computational toys and kits that enable young children (ages 7 years old and under) to explore computational ideas and practices. we collected 30 computational kits, including 13 physical kits, 8 virtual kits, and 9 hybrid kits, and performed a qualitative analysis of these kits. we examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. while many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. we also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing. this qualitative study reveals the commonalities across existing kits and highlights ways for designers and researchers to expand the possibilities for children to create, explore, and play with computing."
MASON2020103898,Development and analysis of the Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey,"there is an increasing emphasis on teaching young learners to code; yet, there are few tools designed to measure the effect of learning to code on children. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool to assess changes in young learners attitudes toward coding: the elementary student coding attitudes survey (escas). we validated the scale using confirmatory factory analysis and structural equation modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 912 years). survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. in our analysis, students grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. students math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors. we discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners attitudes toward coding over time."
VIDENOVIK2022,Migration of an Escape Room–Style Educational Game to an Online Environment: Design Thinking Methodology,"background the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has led to a sudden change in education, closing schools and shifting to online teaching, which has become an enormous challenge for teachers and students. implementing adequate online pedagogical approaches and integrating different digital tools in the teaching process have become a priority in educational systems. finding a way to keep students interest and persistence in learning is an important issue that online education is facing. one possible way to establish engaging and interactive learning environments, using the energy and enthusiasm of students for educational purposes, is the use of game-based learning activities and gamification of different parts of the educational process. objective this paper presents a use case of migrating an escape roomstyle educational game to an online environment by using the design thinking methodology. we wanted to show that the design thinking methodology is useful to create engaging and motivating online games that provide educational value. methods starting from students perspective, we created a simple digital escape roomstyle game where students got an opportunity to self-assess their knowledge in computer science at their own pace. students tested this prototype game, and their opinions about the game were collected through an online survey. the tests goal was to evaluate the students perceptions about the implemented digital escape roomstyle educational game and gather information about whether it could achieve students engagement in learning computer science during online teaching. results in total, 117 students from sixth and seventh grades completed the survey regarding the achieved student engagement. despite the differences in students answers about game complexity and puzzle difficulty, most students liked the activity (mean 4.75, sd 0.67, on a scale from 1 to 5). they enjoyed the game, and they would like to participate in this kind of activity again (mean 4.74, sd 0.68). all (n117, 100) students found the digital escape roomstyle educational game interesting for playing and learning. conclusions the results confirmed that digital escape roomstyle games could be used as an educational tool to engage students in the learning process and achieve learning outcomes. furthermore, the design thinking methodology proved to be a useful tool in the process of adding novel educational value to the digital escape roomstyle game."
LOCKWOOD2020100783,A case for combinatorics: A research commentary,"in this commentary, we make a case for the explicit inclusion of combinatorial topics in mathematics curricula, where it is currently essentially absent. we suggest ways in which researchers might inform the fields understanding of combinatorics and its potential role in curricula. we reflect on five decades of research that has been conducted since a call by kapur (1970) for a greater focus on combinatorics in mathematics education. specifically, we discuss the following five assertions: 1) combinatorics is accessible, 2) combinatorics problems provide opportunities for rich mathematical thinking, 3) combinatorics fosters desirable mathematical practices, 4) combinatorics can contribute positively to issues of equity in mathematics education, and 5) combinatorics is a natural domain in which to examine and develop computational thinking and activity. ultimately, we make a case for the valuable and unique ways in which combinatorics might effectively be leveraged within k-16 curricula."
PILA201952,Learning to code via tablet applications: An evaluation of Daisy the Dinosaur and Kodable as learning tools for young children,"despite the growing number of digital apps designed to teach coding skills to young children, we know little about their effectiveness. to formally explore this question, we conducted a naturalistic observation of a one-week program designed to teach foundational coding skills (i.e., sequencing, conditions, loops) to young children (n 28, mage 5.15 years) using two tablet applications: daisy the dinosaur and kodable. pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of coding apps, knowledge of daisy commands, ability to play kodable, and conceptual understanding of coding. participants improved in their knowledge of daisy commands (i.e., move, grow, jump) and kodable gameplay (i.e., placing arrows in the correct sequence to move a character through a maze), but did not improve in their ability to verbally explain what coding is. appeal of the games was significantly related to childrens learning of daisy commands, but child gender was not related to either daisy or kodable learning outcomes. results suggest that young children can learn foundational coding skills via apps, especially when the apps are appealing to children."
MATTHEWS2021100278,Reconceptualising feedback: Designing educational tangible technologies to be a creative material,"this paper investigates how children who are engaged in a creative project with tangible technology kits make sense of the system feedback the technology provides. a micro-analytic video study was conducted of primary school children designing their own technologies using existing educational microcontrollers. our investigation reveals that the roles feedback plays in childrens interactions cannot easily be assimilated within the existing approaches to understand feedback that have been articulated in hci literature. our qualitative analysis shows how children do not make sense of feedback as semantic communication from the system, but make sense of it with respect to its embeddedness in a sequence of activities they are performing with the system and each other. the principal contribution to emerge from our study is a conception of feedback as a process, rather than as a semantic communicative event, nor a direct coupling of action and system response. our discussion identifies how feedback participates in the institutional agendas of classrooms (e.g. discovery, computational thinking), and draws out initial implications for the design of feedback in educational tangible technologies, identifying possibilities for how feedback might be redesigned to better promote childrens diagnostic practices with open-ended technology kits."
MANCHES2020105859,Identifying embodied metaphors for computing education,"computing education is increasing in global importance, with calls for greater understanding of conceptual development that can inform pedagogy. here, we report a study investigating elementary computing concepts through the lens of embodied cognition. sixteen students (9 female) studying university-level computing were asked to explain their understanding of computing concepts (without materials) in individually video-recorded sessions. we analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. in total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) computing constructs as physical objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) computing processes as motion along a path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences. we contrast our findings to similar research in mathematics and discuss implications for computing pedagogy namely the role of gesture in the classroom and technologies that can exploit embodied metaphors."
PANSKYI2019100593,Out-of-school assistance in the teaching of visual creative programming in the game-based environment – Case study: Poland,"the paper presents effects of out-of-school teaching of computer science in a visual creative programming course (scratch) for children aged 914, held at the lodz university of technology. the research was carrying out during 20162018 school years. the study sample consists of 265 primary and secondary students from lodz voivodeship (province) in central poland. the results were obtained from anonymous questionnaires completed by 221 course participants and their parents. the answers confirm that this type of course becomes a new fascinating manner of spending spare time by children. moreover, quantitative analysis of students finals projects also has been performed. in the process of creative programming in the game-based environment, children develop the computational thinking skills, problem-solving strategies, and abstract thinking. moreover, children are supported by their parents, who notice how important these competences are and how great opportunities they will present for children in future. authors continue to grow scratch programming course to democratize access to new technologies and education, preparing future generation for a world in which computational and algorithmic thinking is a central part of problem-solving. perhaps some of the course participants will continue their study of programming and make it a career for their life."
MORTON2019,Computer Programming: Should Medical Students Be Learning It?,"background the ability to construct simple computer programs (coding) is being progressively recognized as a life skill. coding is now being taught to primary-school children worldwide, but current medical students usually lack coding skills, and current measures of computer literacy for medical students focus on the use of software and internet safety. there is a need to train a cohort of doctors who can both practice medicine and engage in the development of useful, innovative technologies to increase efficiency and adapt to the modern medical world. objective the aim of the study was to address the following questions: (1) is it possible to teach undergraduate medical students the basics of computer coding in a 2-day course (2) how do students perceive the value of learning computer coding at medical school and (3) do students see computer coding as an important skill for future doctors methods we developed a short coding course to teach self-selected cohorts of medical students basic coding. the course included a 2-day introduction on writing software, discussion of computational thinking, and how to discuss projects with mainstream computer scientists, and it was followed on by a 3-week period of self-study during which students completed a project. we explored in focus groups (fgs) whether students thought that coding has a place in the undergraduate medical curriculum. results our results demonstrate that medical students who were complete novices at coding could be taught enough to be able to create simple, usable clinical programs with 2 days of intensive teaching. in addition, 6 major themes emerged from the fgs: (1) making sense of coding, (2) developing the students skill set, (3) the value of coding in medicine, research, and business, (4) role of teaching coding in medical schools, (5) the concept of an enjoyable challenge, and (6) comments on the course design. conclusions medical students can acquire usable coding skills in a weekend course. they valued the teaching and identified that, as well as gaining coding skills, they had acquired an understanding of its potential both for their own projects and in health care delivery and research. they considered that coding skills teaching should be offered as an optional part of the medical curriculum."
BERS2019130,Coding as a playground: Promoting positive learning experiences in childhood classrooms,"in recent years, there has been a push to introduce coding and computational thinking in early childhood education, and robotics is an excellent tool to achieve this. however, the integration of these fundamental skills into formal and official curriculums is still a challenge and educators needs pedagogical perspectives to properly integrate robotics, coding and computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. thus, this study evaluates a coding as a playground experience in keeping with the positive technological development (ptd) framework with the kibo robotics kit, specially designed for young children. the research was conducted with preschool children aged 35 years old (n 172) from three spanish early childhood centers with different socio-economic characteristics and teachers of 16 classes. results confirm that it is possible to start teaching this new literacy very early (at 3 years old). furthermore, the results show that the strategies used promoted communication, collaboration and creativity in the classroom settings. the teachers also exhibited autonomy and confidence to integrate coding and computational thinking into their formal curricular activities, connecting concepts with art, music and social studies. through the evidence found in this study, this research contributes with examples of effective strategies to introduce robotics, coding and computational thinking into early childhood classrooms."
KASPERSEN2022100539,High school students exploring machine learning and its societal implications: Opportunities and challenges,"the increased use of ai and machine learning (ml) calls for a general ai literacy, in particular regarding understanding how ml works, the process behind creating ml models, and reflecting on its implications. where existing learning tools focus on the first two, we explore opportunities and challenges for meaningfully engaging students in understanding and reflecting on ml in their everyday life. we designed votestratesml, following a constructive design research approach, as an ethics-first learning tool that allow students to explore implications of ml for democratic elections. based on deployments of votestratesml in two high school social studies classrooms, we found that safely exploring ml from a concrete starting point helped students reflect and form opinions about its use, that promoting iterative exploration through collaboration and competition motivated them to explore, and that foregrounding ethics in the design and grounding ml in a well-known subject area allowed them to engage with ml on a personal level."
LOVE2022100543,A screen-based or physical computing unit? Examining secondary students’ attitudes toward coding,"in recent years there has been a growing emphasis placed on access to computational thinking (ct) instruction for every k-12 student in the united states (u.s.). concurrently, calls for integrating ct concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) contexts have also increased. this is reflected by the inclusion of ct in the next generation science standards and the standards for technological and engineering literacy. however, methods for teaching ct concepts within secondary level stem courses vary drastically. physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the u.s. in attempts to integrate ct within authentic stem problem-solving contexts. despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. a mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. the results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and careerfuture use of computing concepts. students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices. this study provides implications for improving physical computing instruction and integration within stem education contexts."
TUHKALA201954,"Technology Comprehension — Combining computing, design, and societal reflection as a national subject","this article considers the implementation of a new learning subject technology comprehension into lower secondary schools in denmark, as part of an initiative by the danish ministry of education. the subject consists of learning objectives related to computing, design, and societal reflection and was first introduced as an elective course in 13 schools to investigate how it could be integrated into the danish education system. we present four key findings based on school visits, interviews, an electronical survey, two questionnaires, and workshops including theme discussions: (1) teachers did not perceive technology comprehension as a distinct subject, but rather as a set of skills that can be integrated into other subjects; (2) teachers pointed out that technology comprehension opens up for interdisciplinary and engaging learning activities, but they need more scaffolding and support; (3) technology comprehension challenges teachers existing competencies and there is a need for a framework that takes into account computing, design, and societal reflection as a whole; (4) technology comprehension appealed to various kind of students, not only those who are enthusiastic about technical matters. this study contributes to the previous research on making and digital fabrication by addressing how these endeavours are implemented on a national level through engaging with local teachers. we call for more research on scaffolding and supporting teachers to orchestrate meaningful learning activities to successfully integrate technology comprehension into the danish national education."
SHARMA20221,The design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming,"the ubiquity of smartphone and tablet devices, combined with the increasing availability of serious games, has enabled students to learn various abstract concepts in an appealing and convenient manner. while several researchers have explored the use of augmented reality (ar) in serious games, many of these games have not been critically explained or evaluated. to that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and game learning analytics (gla) to systematize the design and evaluation of an ar-based serious game to teach programming. we evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. the evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice before and after playing the game along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. the game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. the results highlighted various ways in which gla can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. based on players qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. we provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work."

PINHEIRO2024100234,Eye-tracker and fNIRS: Using neuroscientific tools to assess the learning experience during children's educational robotics activities,"in technology education, there has been a paradigmatic shift towards student-centered approaches such as learning by doing, constructionism, and experiential learning. educational robotics allows students to experiment with building and interacting with their creations while also fostering collaborative work. however, understanding the students response to these approaches is crucial to adapting them during the teaching-learning process. in this sense, neuroscientific tools such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy and eye-tracker could be useful, allowing the investigation of relevant states experienced by students. although they have already been used in educational research, their practical relevance in the teaching-learning process has not been extensively investigated. in this perspective article expressing our position, we bring four examples of learning experiences in a robotics class with children, in which we illustrate the usefulness of these tools."
BRIAN2023129074,Introducing mindset streams to investigate stances towards STEM in high school students and experts,"we introduce mindset streams for assessing ways of bridging two target concepts in concept maps. we focus on behavioural forma mentis networks (bfmn), which map the associative and affective dimensions of memory recalls. inspired by trains of thoughts taking several paths to link ideas, mindset streams are defined as bfmn subgraphs induced by all shortest paths between two target concepts, e.g. all recalls in shortest paths bridging math and learning. these streams quantify the following features of the mindset encoded in a bfmn: (i) semantic content (i.e. which ideas mediate connections between targets), (ii) valence coherenceconflict (i.e. are connections mediated by entwining ideas perceived negatively, positively or neutrally), and (iii) semantic relevance (i.e. are the bridges between targets peripheral or central for the connectivitybetweenness of the bfmn). we investigate mindset streams between mathsphysics and key motivational aspects of learning (fun, work, failure) in two bfmns, encoding how 159 students and 59 experts perceived and associated concepts about science technology engineering and maths (stem), respectively. statistical comparisons against configuration models show that high schoolers bridge maths and fun only through overabundant levels of valence-conflicting associations, contrasting negatively perceived domain knowledge with peer-related positive experiences. this conflict is absent in the researchers mindset stream, which rather bridges math and fun through positive, science-related associations. the mindset streams of both groups bridge maths and physics to work through mostly positive career-related jargon. students mindset streams of failure and mathphysics are dominated by negative associations with test anxiety, whereas researchers integrate failure and mathphysics in semantically richer and more positive contexts, denoting failure itself as a cornerstone of stem learning. we discuss our findings and future research directions in view of relevant psychologyeducation literature."
OTTENBREITLEFTWICH2021100057,The impact of an issue-centered problem-based learning curriculum on 6th grade girls’ understanding of and interest in computer science,"many stakeholders have suggested that if girls are not engaged in computer science at an early age, the field of computer science (cs) (and computing-related fields) will continue to lack gender diversity. we need more explorations of how curriculum impacts girls interest in computer science at the elementary level. the focus of this research project was to examine how an elementary problem-based learning (pbl) curriculum impacted girls understanding of and interest in cs. by utilizing a curriculum focused on a problem that emphasized social activism, we hypothesized that pbl cs could increase interest in cs for girls. this study used a mixed-method sequential explanatory research design to examine the implementation of a cs pbl curriculum with four 6th grade teachers and their 263 students. we collected student cs knowledge pre-tests and post-tests, student attitude surveys, student focus group interviews, teacher interviews, and researcher observation reflection notes. the knowledge tests were analyzed using a mixed measures anova. the survey responses were analyzed using anovas and effect sizes for each comparison were calculated using partial eta squared. the qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic approach that required four researchers to come to a consensus. results suggested that although girls had less understanding of cs at the beginning, by the end of the curriculum, girls and boys performed similarly. however, there were still elements that were not successful. girls attitudes towards computer science were significantly lower than the boys at the end of the curriculum. conceptually, the curriculum needs to specifically address how cs could impact values held by girls."
XU2025100685,Robotic roles in education: A systematic review based on a proposed framework of the learner-robot relationships,"with the development of computer and information techniques, robotics education provides potential to reshape the instructional and learning process in the educational system. from the perspective of the educational system, it is essential to understand the roles of robotics in education as well as their relationships with learners. specifically, this systematic review proposed a conceptual framework based on two dimensions (i.e., learner agency, robotic interactivity) and reviewed 92 empirical studies from 2010 to 2023 to clarify four categories of robotic roles, namely learning about robotics, learning through robotics, learning from robotics, and learning with robotics. in learning about robotics, educational robotics are merely the learning objects or contents by learners. in learning through robotics, educational robotics serve as the learning tools or assists, and learners can take their agency to operate or design robotics. in learning from robotics, educational robotics act as tutors to convey and deliver knowledge and information to learners. in learning with robotics, educational robotics serve as the peers or companions of learners and collaborate with learners to provide emotional supports, solve problems and construct knowledge. furthermore, this study examined the applied educational contexts (i.e., educational domain, educational level) and learning effects of the four robotic roles. overall, the future development of robotics education highlights both learner agency and robotic interactivity to achieve the goal of a learner-centered, robot-friendly learning."
OKU2023123,Chapter Six - Analyzing teacher–student interactions through graph theory applied to hyperscanning fNIRS data,"teacherstudent relationships have been found consistently important for student school effectiveness in mathematics in the last three decades. although this observation is generally made from the teachers perspective, neuroscience can provide new insights by establishing the neurobiological underpinning of social interactions. this paper further develops this line of research by utilizing graph theory to represent interactions between teachers and students at the neural level. through hyperscanning with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs), we collected data from the prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction of 24 dyads composed of a teacher and a student. each dyad used a board game to perform a programming logic class that consisted of three steps: independent activities (control), presentation of concepts, and interactive exercises. graph theory provides results regarding the strength of teacherstudent interaction and the main channels involved in these interactions. we combined graph modularity and bootstrap to measure pair coactivation, thus establishing the strength of teacherstudent interaction. also, graph centrality detects the main brain channels involved during this interaction. in general, the teachers most relevant nodes rely on the regions related to language and number processing, spatial cognition, and attention. also, the students most relevant nodes rely on the regions related to task management."

LEHMANN2023101079,Using algorithmic thinking to design algorithms: The case of critical path analysis,"algorithmic thinking is emerging as an important competence in mathematics education, yet research appears to be lagging this shift in curricular focus. the aim of this generative study is to examine how students use the cognitive skills of algorithmic thinking to design algorithms. task-based interviews were conducted with four pairs of year 12 students (n 8) to analyze how they used decomposition and abstraction to specify the projects, designed algorithms to solve scheduling problems by first devising fundamental operations and then using algorithmic concepts to account for complex and special cases of the problems, and tested and debugged their algorithms. a deductive-inductive analytical process was used to classify students responses according to the four cognitive skills to develop sets of subskills to describe how the students engaged these cognitive skills."
YIM2024100321,Artificial intelligence literacy in primary education: An arts-based approach to overcoming age and gender barriers,"artificial intelligence (ai) literacy education was previously taught primarily at the university and secondary school levels but has recently started to be expanded to primary school settings. when available at the primary school level, ai literacy is often taught within computer science courses, which may potentially reinforce gender stereotypes and discourage female students engagement. in ai literacy education, the predominant teaching methods are constructivist approaches, which, while effective in fostering active learning, heavily emphasize technical skills and are therefore limited in their pedagogical scope, as they underplay other important questions, such as disinformation, data justice, and ais ethical and societal implications. the lack of a clear definition of ai literacy for primary education also raises questions about what to teach and how to teach it. additionally, little attention has been devoted to understanding gender differences in learning outcomes within ai literacy primary education. this study advocates the use of an arts-based transdisciplinary approach for teaching ai literacy to 25 primary school students. a pilot study utilizing mixed methods was conducted to assess the effectiveness of this arts-based approach. quantitative analysis through a paired t-test revealed a statistically significant improvement in ai literacy among students participating in knowledge tests. moreover, the results of the mannwhitney and kruskalwallis tests indicated that gender and age did not impact pre- and post-knowledge test scores. qualitative analyses further revealed the pedagogical benefits of the arts-based approach, demonstrating that students enhance their conceptual understanding of ai literacy by reflecting on their artifacts. this study contributes to the literature by providing evidence with a small sample size that the arts-based approach can overcome age and gender barriers to accessing ai literacy education and can serve as a means to teach ai thinking."
ABUHAY2018193,Analysis of publication activity of computational science society in 2001–2017 using topic modelling and graph theory,"this paper presents the results of topic modelling and analysis of topic networks using the corpus of the international conference on computational science (iccs), which contains 5982 domain-specific papers over seventeen years 20012017. we discuss the topical structures of iccs, and show how these topics have evolved over time in response to the topicality of various domains, technologies and methods, and how all these topics relate to one another. this analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors keywords. the results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how computational thinking has propagated across different fields of study. we used the non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. the resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. next, we applied trend analysis and change point analysis (cpa) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. we used gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an r library called dya to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. we also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks. the results show that authors of iccs papers continue to actively collaborate after the conference on average authors collaborate with three other iccs authors, which suggests that iccs is a valuable platform for collaboration development."
JOO2024226,Teaching and Learning Model for Artificial Intelligence Education,"ai education aims to nurture convergence talents equipped with various knowledge and ai capabilities. however, the educational programs developed so far are designed for less than 10 sessions. this is insufficient time for students to understand artificial intelligence algorithms, utilize the learned principles of artificial intelligence, and expand by converging with various knowledge. since the developmental characteristics of students in the lower grades of elementary school are different, it is difficult to apply them as they are. therefore, it is necessary to study the following ai education teaching and learning methods suitable for lower grade students. in this study, we develop a teaching system design model for artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education for elementary school students in the lower grades, and based on this, design and apply an artificial intelligence-based subject convergence education program. experiments were conducted with 47 second-year elementary school students, and students responses were better in the ai-based convergence education program than in general subject classes in terms of interest, understanding, and expectations for classes."
BESTER2024820,Complementary conservation of South African crop wild relatives for plant improvement,"crop wild relatives (cwr) are good sources of unexplored genetic diversity that can assist plant breeders to increase the yield and resilience of their crops. these species are valuable plant genetic resources (pgr) that have been used in more than 4,157 documented cases of plant improvement to date. south africa has 258 prioritized cwr, selected based on their distribution, threat status and potential as gene donors. in light of ongoing habitat destruction, global warming and mismanagement of resources, the conservation of these pgr is vital. complementary conservation approaches allow for the continuous development of cwr, while harnessing and applying the available diversity in plant breeding programs. the south african national biodiversity strategy and action plan (nbsap) strives to utilize conservation resources to build and maintain an effective complementary, in situ to ex situ conservation pipeline. as part of the southern african development community (sadc), south africa has access to numerous resources that can assist to protect its rich floral diversity, including the sadc plant genetic resource centre (spgrc), the sadc cwr project and capfitogen3."

ANGGORO2025500158,Effect of game-based learning on students’ mathematics high order thinking skills: A meta-analysis,"educational research trends demonstrate a growing interest in understanding the impact of games on mathematics achievement. however, only a limited number of studies have synthesized previous quantitative studies to investigate how game-based learning (gbl) influences the enhancement of students high-order thinking skills (hots) in mathematics. to address this gap, this meta-analysis study aims to investigate the effectiveness of gbl on students mathematics hots. the study analyzed 40 effect sizes from 13 empirical studies published from 2010 to 2024, gathered from electronic databases such as scopus, eric, and pro-quest. r software was employed for analyzing effect sizes, detecting publication bias, and conducting subgroup analyses. using the k-means algorithm, two studies identified as outliers were excluded. after removing these outliers, the findings revealed a positive effect of gbl on students mathematics hots, with an overall effect falling within the small category (g.134, p.001). additionally, moderator variables, including educational level, measured thinking skills, continent, control treatment, and intervention duration, significantly influenced the improvement of hots using gbl, while the sample size factor showed no significant impact. all findings, limitations, and implications are discussed in this article. resumen las tendencias de investigacin educativa muestran un creciente inters en comprender el impacto de los juegos en el logro en matemticas. sin embargo, solo un nmero limitado de estudios ha sintetizado investigaciones cuantitativas previas para investigar cmo el aprendizaje basado en juegos (abj) influye en la mejora de las habilidades de pensamiento de alto nivel (hots) de los estudiantes en matemticas. para abordar esta brecha, se ha realizado un estudio de metaanlisis con el objetivo de investigar la efectividad del abj en las hots matemticas de los estudiantes. el estudio ha analizado 40 tamaos de efecto de 13 estudios empricos publicados desde 2010 hasta 2024, recopilados de bases de datos electrnicas como scopus, eric y pro-quest. se ha empleado el software r para analizar los tamaos de efecto, detectar sesgo de publicacin y realizar anlisis de subgrupos. utilizando el algoritmo k-means, se han excluido dos estudios identificados como valores atpicos. despus de eliminar estos valores atpicos, los hallazgos han revelado un efecto positivo del abj en las hots matemticas de los estudiantes, con un efecto general situado dentro de la categora pequea (g.134, p.001). adems, se ha encontrado que variables moderadoras, incluido el nivel educativo, las habilidades de pensamiento medidas, el continente, el tratamiento de control y la duracin de la intervencin, han influido significativamente en la mejora de las hots mediante el abj; mientras que el factor de tamao de la muestra no ha mostrado un impacto significativo. se han discutido todos los hallazgos, limitaciones e implicaciones en este artculo."
AGUAYO2023e19205,Ethical enactivism for smart and inclusive STEAM learning design,"current global challenges of the 21st century promote steam (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) education and digitalization as a means for humans to be the central actors in the construction of a sustainable society that favors a sense of worth and global wellbeing. in this scenario, new educational technology tools and immersive learning affordances (possibilities), offer unprecedented potential for the design of smart and dynamic learning systems and contexts that can enhance learning processes across varied audiences and educational settings. however, current steam education practice lacks attention to equipping all citizens with the necessary skills to use digital technologies in an ethical, critical and creative way. this gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. on the other hand, in its formulation steam as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during steam education design. following an apparent need to explore ethical and inclusive design in steam education, and inspired in the 4e cognition framework, ethical enactivism and embodied and ecosomaesthetics experience design, here we propose a theoretical framework grounded on systems thinking for the design of smart and dynamic steam learning systems and settings. the framework is aimed at steam educational psychologists, educational technologists, learning designers and educational practitioners who wish to address the global challenges of 21st century education by means of creative, innovative and inclusive education design."
CSERNOCH2025100676,Lean digital education to resolve the paradox of the illusion of digital prosperity,"digital education, including digitally supported education, is loaded with biases. most participants are blinded by the abundance of digital devices and misled by the hardware and software providers who try to convince and force education systems to keep track of untraceable developments. however, recent studies have revealed that the productivity of the participants and the sustainability of their digital artifacts generate a huge but silent waste, both in terms of human and machine resources. this contradiction generates a paradox in which the illusion of digital prosperity does not allow us to clearly see the ineffectiveness of digital processes and artifacts and the losses piling up. our research revealed that the methodology of lean thinking allows us to find the root causes of the problems and the revolutionary changes which must be applied to eliminate the waste generated by the participants in the digital era. it was also found that the adaptation of the lean philosophy, proven effective in production, services, and administration, can be a solution in resolving the paradox of digital education, which leads us to lean digital education (lde). within this framework instead of the widely accepted tool-centered ideas we offer a human-centered, long-term thinking philosophy focusing on respect for participants, on their development, tasks, and problems, while at the same time eliminating and reducing waste. the present paper details the strength of this innovative approach which is based on (1) a solid theoretical background (2) a reliable measuring system for calculating the waste of digital activities and artifacts, (3) approaches proven to be effective and efficient in end-user data management, and (4) examples of the learning-teaching materials which support the philosophy adapted."

MOODLEY2022e1855,Ethics and governance challenges related to genomic data sharing in southern Africa: the case of SARS-CoV-2,"summary data sharing in research is fraught with controversy. academic success is premised on competitive advantage, with research teams protecting their research findings until publication. research funders, by contrast, often require data sharing. beyond traditional research and funding requirements, surveillance data have become contentious. public health emergencies involving pathogens require intense genomic surveillance efforts and call for the rapid sharing of data on the basis of public interest. under these circumstances, timely sharing of data becomes a matter of scientific integrity. during the covid-19 pandemic, the transformative potential of genomic pathogen data sharing became obvious and advanced the debate on data sharing. however, when the genomic sequencing data of the omicron (b.1.1.529) variant was shared and announced by scientists in southern africa, various challenges arose, including travel bans. the scientific, economic, and moral impact was catastrophic. yet, travel restrictions failed to mitigate the spread of the variant already present in countries outside africa. public perceptions of the negative effect of data sharing are detrimental to the willingness of research participants to consent to sharing data in postpandemic research and future pandemics. global health governance organisations have an important role in developing guidance on responsible sharing of genomic pathogen data in public health emergencies."

STOLPE2024100159,Artificial intelligence literacy for technology education,"the interest in artificial intelligence (ai) in education has erupted during the last few years, primarily due to technological advances in ai. it is therefore argued that students should learn about ai, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. ai literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with ai. this study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating ai literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. this study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of ai literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. the data consists of five ai literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical technical understanding. the results show that ai literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what ai is, how to recognise ai, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., ai ethics and the role of humans in ai). technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for ai literacy for technology education is suggested."

HONTELEZ2025103233,The impact of the PEPFAR funding freeze on HIV deaths and infections: a mathematical modelling study of seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa,"summary background on january 24, 2025, the united states government issued an executive order to freeze all foreign aid programs, including the presidents emergency plan for aids relief (pepfar), for 90 days. a limited waiver option became available, but its implementation remains incomplete. we estimated the impact of these policy changes on hiv deaths and new infections in seven sub-saharan african (ssa) countriesethiopia, kenya, malawi, south africa, tanzania, zambia, and zimbabwe , which together account for about half of all people living with hiv in ssa. methods we used stdsim, an established individual-based simulation model, and previously published quantifications for the seven countries. we predicted changes in hiv deaths and new infections over the period 20252030 for four scenarios: (1) executive orderproportional, where treatment disruption was proportional to the country-specific pepfars share of total hiv funding; (2) executive orderrealistic, assuming near-total system collapse due to program dependencies; and (34) waiver scenarios where treatment was resumed after 4 or after 8 weeks. resumptions of programs accounted for delays due to organizational and logistical challenges. findings a 90-day funding freeze would result in 60 thousand 95 ui: 4971 thousand excess hiv deaths for the executive orderproportional scenario. this number would increase to 74 thousand excess hiv deaths 95 ui: 6389 thousand for the executive orderrealistic scenario. under a 4-week and 8-week waiver scenario, projected excess hiv deaths ranged between 21 thousand 95 ui: 1528 thousand and 28 thousand 95 ui: 2236 thousand respectively. excess new infections ranged between 35 and 103 thousand for the different scenarios. interpretation the sudden cessation of pepfar funding likely results in tens of thousands of hiv deaths and new infections. these losses of life and health should compel the united states government to rapidly and fully re-instate one of the most successful health programs in history. funding none."
LIU2023101239,The use of code glosses in three minute thesis presentations: A comprehensibility strategy,"the three minute thesis (3mt) is an academic competition that challenges graduate students to explain their research in 3 minutes to a non-specialist audience. while there have been a few studies examining rhetorical moves and interactional metadiscourse in 3mt presentations, studies focusing on features related to comprehensibility, a key competition requirement, have been lacking. this study examines how highly-specialised research is made comprehensible to non-specialist audiences through code glosses, communication strategies that function to facilitate understanding by reformulating, explaining, or elaborating on what has been said (hyland, 2005). analysing a corpus of 50 successful 3mt presentations in the electrical and computer engineering discipline, we found code glosses to be one of the most frequently used interactive metadiscourse types in the data. significantly, analogies and definitions emerged as salient-enough features in our data that we added them as additional categories of code gloss, extending hylands (2007) two categories of exemplifiers and reformulators. our analysis shows how examples, definitions, analogies, and reformulations are used in distinct ways in 3mt presentations to make the presented research accessible, coherent, and engaging to audiences. our findings expand current understandings of code glosses, and extend the current knowledge on the 3mt genre by providing insights into its distinctive linguistic features vis--vis comprehensibility."
RACHMATULLAH2020100018,Development and validation of the Computer Science Attitudes Scale for middle school students (MG-CS attitudes),"primary and secondary students exposure to computer science-related activities in school has been steadily increasing, heightening the need for valid measures regarding impact of these activities on students. this study reports on the development and validation process of an instrument to measure students affective state as it relates to computer science in an academic setting. the self-report instrument, computer science attitudes scale for middle school students (mg-cs attitudes), was developed based upon expectancy-value theory, which assumes two attitudinal constructs: self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. a set of ten initial items was administered to 663 middle-grade students from sixth to eighth grade (1113 years of age). a combination of classical test theory and item response theory approaches were used to evaluate and validate the instrument using well-established construct validity frameworks to guide the process, leading to nine final items. the multi-stage validation process has resulted in a robust, well-functioning instrument, which can be used by researchers and evaluators to study cs-related educational interventions."

SCHAFER2024105962,"Executive functions and problem-solving—The contribution of inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility to science problem-solving performance in elementary school students","previous research has shown that executive functions can contribute to successful problem-solving in preschool and elementary school children. however, most studies did not simultaneously assess the role of different specific aspects of executive functions. therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the individual contribution of inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility to science problem-solving performance in elementary school children. a total of 478 children from first and second grades (mage 7.44 years) participated in our study. they performed a gono-go task (inhibition), a corsi blocks backward task (working memory), a flexible item selection task (cognitive flexibility), and three science problem-solving tasks, including two gear turning tasks and one stabilization task. structural equation modeling showed that working memory and cognitive flexibility individually contributed to problem-solving performance, whereas inhibition did not. we conclude that maintaining task requirements and dynamic object relations (working memory) and switching between different problem-solving phases (cognitive flexibility) are essential components of successful science problem-solving in elementary school children. inhibitory processes may be more relevant in tasks involving a higher degree of interference at the task or response level."
CHENG2019361,Exploring factors influencing the acceptance of visual programming environment among boys and girls in primary schools,"there has recently been a renewed interest in integrating programming into the curriculum of primary education, partly due to the availability of the visual programming environment (vpe) designed for educational purposes. while substantial progress on exploring the potential benefits of vpe has been achieved, much remains to be done to understand students acceptance of vpe and whether gender difference plays a role in their acceptance. this study was thus designed to extend the technology acceptance model to identify determinants influencing boys and girls behavioural intention to use vpe in the primary school context. it used a mixed method approach to evaluate the proposed model using questionnaire and interview data collected from 431 students (296 boys and 135 girls) in 38 primary schools. among boys and girls, computer self-efficacy is shown to be the external factor significantly influencing both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of vpe, while attitude towards vpe is found to have a significant effect on behavioural intention to use vpe. in addition, gender differences are found in the impact of social influence and external encouragement on students perceptions towards vpe, and also in the impact of students perceptions towards vpe on their behavioural intention to use it. based on the findings, several recommendations are made to encourage primary students to use vpe for programming."
WEINTROP20191,"The cloud is the limit: A case study of programming on the web, with the web","the last ten years have seen a proliferation of introductory programming environments for younger learners. increasingly, these environments are moving into the cloud where they can be accessed through web browsers and run on a variety of devices including tablets and smartphones. the shift to online settings enables a variety of powerful pedagogical features to be incorporated into the design of these learning environments, including making it easy to share learner-authored programs, browse projects written by others, and allow learners to incorporate various internet resources into their work. further, the internet itself can serve as a productive canvas upon which novice programmers can create in the form of dynamic and interactive web pages. this shift in venue for authoring and editing programs is particularly well-suited for young learners growing up in an increasingly online world. in this paper, we present theoretical and practical arguments for online introductory programming environments as powerful learning tools and present data showing various ways young learners take advantage of features of the environment enabled by being situated online. in particular, the paper looks at how the online context can support young learners in authoring programs and interacting with programs authored by others. the contribution of this work is to advance our understanding of how the internet can be utilized as a resource to situate learning and serve as an inviting and accessible pathway into computing."
TSAI2025105305,Effects of integrating self-regulation scaffolding supported by chatbot and online collaborative reflection on students’ learning in an artificial intelligence course,"artificial intelligence (ai) includes complex concepts and could be difficult for non-computer or information students, and they may experience difficulties in an ai course. in order to develop students ai skills, regulate their academic stress, and reduce student loneliness, the researchers in this study integrated self-regulation scaffolding (supported by a chatbot designed in this study) with online collaborative reflection, and investigated their effects on students learning. the researchers conducted a quasi-experiment to explore the effects of self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection. the participants in this experiment were 116 undergraduates from three classes (groups) of a non-computer department taking a compulsory course titled introduction to artificial intelligence. the experimental groups in this study included the first class (g1) simultaneously receiving the interventions of self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection, as well as the second class (g2) only receiving the intervention of self-regulation scaffolding. the last class (g3), that received a traditional teaching method (non-self-regulation scaffolding and non-online collaborative reflection) in an online ai course, served as the control group. according to the statistical analysis in this study, the self-regulation scaffolding approach in g2 significantly promoted participants ai skills and fostered their ability to regulate academic stress compared to the control group. however, g1 students who received concurrent online collaborative reflection did not demonstrate the expected effects of enhancing their learning compared with those (g2) who did not receive it. this study represents an early attempt to implement self-regulation scaffolding and online collaborative reflection integrated with chatbot in an online ai course. the results of this study could serve as a reference for online course designers, educators, and scholars planning to adopt these teaching methods, especially for those focusing on implementing online ai education and educational technologies (such as chatbot)."

AZEKA2022e10517,Building a school data portal using open data: A description of the user research & development process,"the lack of relevant and disaggregated data about schools is a challenge for organizations implementing and funders looking to invest in kindergarten through 12th-grade education programs in new york city (nyc), often forcing organizations to make critical programmatic and financial decisions with only partial or anecdotal information about schools and its existing efforts. over the last two years, an institution of higher education and a private foundation worked together to address this problem by indexing text in thousands of annual school reports and combining multiple open data sets about schools, including geography, demographics, and academic performance, into a single database. the initial use case focused on understanding the existing computing education efforts in nyc. however, seeing the potential to inform a broader set of questions, the collaborators began exploring the utility of such data with program officers at the foundation. interviews of program officers around their programmatic needs and challenges illuminated their struggles with analyzing scattered data, difficulty accessing non-academic data and the need for disaggregated and geographical data. these findings are being used to inform the development of a data portal that interfaces with the aggregated dataset for foundations and others interested in data about schools."
LACHNEY2023100591,From endpoints to trading zones: Multi-directional exchange for computational empowerment in computer science education,"in this paper we build on a conceptual framing of computational empowerment that seeks to provide alternative endpoints for computer science (cs) education beyond degree attainment and job placement. but, as opposed to a teleological framing that prioritizes ends, we propose using the metaphor of trading zones to construct a framing for computational empowerment that is based on collaborative multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge between people with different expertise. this leaves the co-design and implementation of cs education open to emergent directions and possibilities. using a descriptive case study methodology, we detail trading zones in two different co-design projects that sought to situate cs education in relationship to cultural contexts through multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge: (1) a co-design project in a youth boxing gym with coaches, mentors, and staff; (2) a co-design project in a high school barbering program with a barbering instructor and barbering students. our findings show that the metaphor is useful for the concept of computational empowerment in ways that are reflexive and interventionist."
NYONI2022100434,Spatial clustering of codeine use and its association with depression: a geospatial analysis of nationally representative South African data,"background there is an alarming trend in sub-saharan africa in the use of codeine-containing pharmaceuticals, but its risk of common comorbidities, such as mental health, remains unquantified at a national-level. we investigated the relationship between codeine use and onset of depression in south africa at a population-level. methods we used nationally representative panel data from the south africa national income dynamic study to investigate the relationship between exposure to codeine use in the community (i.e. residing in a codeine hotspot) and onset of depression. geographical hotspots of codeine use were identified using kulldorff spatial scan statistic in satscan. we quantified depression onset at wave 5 (year 2017) between individuals residing inside and outside a codeine hotspot who were depression-free at enrolment (wave 4: 2015) using generalised estimating equation (gee) regression models. results we identified four statistically significant hotspots of codeine use, mostly located at the northern part of the country. among 13,020 participants who were depression-free at enrolment, residing within a codeine use hotspot was significantly associated with higher subsequent onset of depression (arr1.21, 95 ci:1.08-1.44). limitations data on diagnosis of depressive disorder were not available. conclusion south africa, a resource scarce nation with chronically limited mental health services, is not spared from the global opioid epidemic and its impact on depression. targeted scale-up access to agonist therapy to effectively treat (opioid) addiction in communities at risk for high exposure to codeine use could reduce the risk of subsequent mental health challenges."
SIMOESGOMES201877,Exploring an approach based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children,"the inclusion of programming topics in the initial grades of school gives rise to debates about the best ways to teach these contents. programmable toys, activities with physical materials and various games are some of the resources available. amongst those, digital games possess important elements for learning programming, such as incremental challenges, personalised immediate feedback, and visualisation of the consequences of errors. in this work, we explore the results of an experience based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children. our aim was to investigate how such concepts are presented in the games interface and what is the impact of the interaction elements on childrens comprehension. this work took place in informatics classes of a brazilian school, with 42 students aged 5 to 7 years. data were collected through participant observation, and semi-structured and unstructured interviews, focusing on the main difficulties faced by the children when interacting with the games. topics, skills and competences were considered according to the syllabus proposed by computing at school, and encompassed sequences of instructions, repetition loops and conditionals. results indicate a satisfactory understanding of sequences of instructions and conditionals, but also show challenges with respect to graphical symbols, text and interaction elements identified as hard to understand for the children, making the support of an adult fundamental. another critical point was the comprehension of the concept of repetition, which made the use of complementary approaches necessary, in particular unplugged playful activities. this shows that despite the increasing number of available digital games that involve programming basics, good solutions for conveying the main concepts to young children have not yet been found, demanding further investigation, possibly towards structured hybrid approaches combining digital games and unplugged activities."

LIN2020103944,Assessing learning in technology-rich maker activities: A systematic review of empirical research,"maker activities are drawing increasing attention in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) education. researchers have developed various assessments for maker activities to examine students learning outcomes. however, a systematic review of research on such assessments is lacking. to fill this gap, we reviewed empirical studies on maker-based assessments in education. we systematically examined 60 studies regarding the overall features of the maker activities, the learning outcomes that were measured, the assessment formats, and the psychometric evidence of the assessments. our review results indicate that more than 20 types of maker platforms have been employed in the activities, with e-textiles and lilypad arduino being the most popular. five types of assessment tools have been used prevalently to examine students diverse learning outcomes, specifically artifact assessments, tests, surveys, interviews, and observations. most assessments are used in stem-related maker activities, especially technology-centric activities, to measure stem-related learning outcomes. only 15 of the studies provide psychometric evidence of reliability and validity for the assessments. based on the findings, we provide suggestions for future research which include developing more low-tech maker activities for students in lower-grades and with lower technology proficiency. in addition, future studies should improve rubrics for artifact assessment and explore more assessment tools for non-stem subjects."
SIGAYRET2022104505,Unplugged or plugged-in programming learning: A comparative experimental study,"in recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple ability to code. however, there are different ways of teaching this subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and unplugged programming learning. the purpose of this study is to highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students performance and subjective experience. to this end, we designed an experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts, ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction, self-belief and attitude toward science. the programming sessions were designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were different. computers and scratch software were used in the plugged-in group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures, figurines and body movements instead. the results show better learning performance in the plugged-in group. furthermore, although motivation dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the unplugged condition. gender also seems to be an important factor, as girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to pursue their practice in programming outside the school context. however, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in group which suggests that educational programming software may have a positive but gendered motivational impact."

BRADY2022101156,Block-based abstractions and expansive services to make advanced computing concepts accessible to novices,"many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. however, most offer only restricted access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue http requests. but in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other computers or accessing resources and data on the internet), the limited support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. we argue that it is feasible to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely-used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the internet of things, and cybersecurity to novices. the paper presents the architecture of and design decisions behind netsblox, a programming environment that supports these ideas. we show how netsblox expands opportunities for learning considerably: netsblox projects can access a wealth of online data and web services, and they can communicate with other projects. moreover, the tool infrastructure enables young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction, whether they share their physical location or study remotely. importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. in this way, netsblox offers an illuminating example of how tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing."

RICHARDSON2022880,"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron triggers cross-reactive neutralization and Fc effector functions in previously vaccinated, but not unvaccinated, individuals","summary the sars-cov-2 omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccines or infection. however, whether omicron triggers cross-reactive humoral responses to other variants of concern (vocs) remains unknown. we used plasma from 20 unvaccinated and 7 vaccinated individuals infected by omicron ba.1 to test binding, fc effector function, and neutralization against vocs. in unvaccinated individuals, fc effector function and binding antibodies targeted omicron and other vocs at comparable levels. however, omicron ba.1-triggered neutralization was not extensively cross-reactive for vocs (14- to 31-fold titer reduction), and we observed 4-fold decreased titers against omicron ba.2. in contrast, vaccination followed by breakthrough omicron infection associated with improved cross-neutralization of vocs with titers exceeding 1:2,100. this has important implications for the vulnerability of unvaccinated omicron-infected individuals to reinfection by circulating and emerging vocs. although omicron-based immunogens might be adequate boosters, they are unlikely to be superior to existing vaccines for priming in sars-cov-2-naive individuals."

HARRIS2023101038,Spatial visualization and measurement of area: A case study in spatialized mathematics instruction,"the purpose of this study was to explore the influence of spatial visualization skills when students solve area tasks. spatial visualization is closely related to mathematics achievement, but little is known about how these skills link to task success. we examined middle school students representations and solutions to area problems (both non-metric and metric) through qualitative and quantitative task analysis. task solutions were analyzed as a function of spatial visualization skills and links were made between student solutions on tasks with different goals (i.e., non-metric and metric). findings suggest that strong spatial visualizers solved the tasks with relative ease, with evidence for conceptual and procedural understanding. by contrast, low and average spatial students more frequently produced errors due to failure to correctly determine linear measurements or apply appropriate formula, despite adequate procedural knowledge. a novel finding was the facilitating role of spatial skills in the link between metric task representation and success in determining a solution. from a teaching and learning perspective, these results highlight the need to connect emergent spatial skills with mathematical content and support students to develop conceptual understanding in parallel with procedural competence."
LAAKSO2021104308,Developing students’ digital competences through collaborative game design,"background this exploratory study engaged teams of elementary and middle school students in the collaborative design of digital games. game design is theoretically examined in this study as a form of knowledge-creating learning that is characterized by collaborative efforts to advance a shared object of activity, i.e., the game being designed. using mixed methods, we examined how students experienced the game design project and how the project fostered connected learning, that is, integration of students personal interests and supportive peer relations with their schoolwork, and how their self-assessed digital competences developed. methods the digital competences of 98 comprehensive school students across finland were traced using pre- and post-questionnaires. the post-questionnaire also included validated measures on connected learning. quantitative methods were used to analyze structured measures, and qualitative methods were used to analyze open-ended measures. findings students experienced game design as an inspiring, challenging activity. game design engaged student teams in sustained, collaborative efforts to create shared digital artifacts. their efforts involved a great deal of mutual support and knowledge sharing. participation also improved students self-reported technical and artistic digital competences. the game design project fostered informal, interest-driven, sociodigital participation; inspired learning engagement; and improved schoolwork practices. contribution the game design project appeared to be a pedagogically meaningful way of engaging students in knowledge-creating learning and of connecting students formal and informal learning. the project sparked students motivation to learn, fostered digital competences, and enriched the learning environment."
LEE2015241,Determining the effects of computer science education at the secondary level on STEM major choices in postsecondary institutions in the United States,"concerning the marginalization of computer science education in k-12 stem education in the united states, this study examined the extent to which taking more credits in computer science courses at the secondary level predicts students stem major choices in postsecondary institutions in the u.s., by comparison to the well-documented predictors of students stem major choices after controlling for student demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, ses, and racial background). these predictors include credits earned in math and science courses as well as act math scores. drawing on a nationally representative sample of u.s. young adults who were 12th graders in 2004 and disclosed their college majors by 2006, logistic regression analyses revealed that students who took more units in computer science courses were significantly more likely to choose stem majors in both 4-year and 2-year postsecondary institutions. moreover, regardless of the type of postsecondary institutions that students attended, taking more units in computer science courses played a significant role in choosing stem majors. in addition, the effects of computer science education on student stem major selection were equally as strong as the effects of math and science education. the results suggest that promoting the quality of computer science education is just as important in motivating students to pursue stem education and career choices at the secondary level as are math and science education."
TSENG2025106570,Exploring artificial intelligence literacy and the use of ChatGPT and copilot in instruction on nursing academic report writing,"background nursing education increasingly emphasizes academic writing and communication, critical for delivering quality patient care and professional advancement. rapidly emerging artificial intelligence (ai) tools such as chatgpt and copilot are transforming educational methodologies, and a focus is being placed on embedding ai literacy to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. these technologies have the potential to reshape nursing education in a technology-driven health-care landscape. aim this study investigated the effectiveness of ai literacy and the application of chatgpt and copilot in academic nursing report writing. it assessed the level of ai literacy of nursing students, examined the integration of basic ai concepts into a curriculum, and analyzed the impact of these tools compared with traditional teaching methods. methods the study adopted a sample of 203 senior nursing students from southern taiwan to compare an ai-enhanced teaching approach using chatgpt and copilot with conventional methods. the curriculum, centered on the writing case reports and seminars course, employed the analyze, design, develop, implement, evaluate model and incorporated scaffolding techniques to synergistically integrate clinical skills with academic learning. ai literacy was measured using the meta ai literacy scale (mails). summative assessments, adhering to the taiwan nursing association standards, focused on individual and group case report evaluations. findings following an 18-week ai intervention, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in all dimensions of the mails. a chatgpt usage of 100 was found, with a notable enhancement discovered in the nursing plan section of case reports. although the experimental group outperformed the control group in overall case report evaluations, the connections between identified problems and proposed plans were weaker and nursing interventions tended to be less individualized for the experimental group. conclusions the incorporation of ai tools such as chatgpt and copilot into a scaffolding teaching framework significantly boosted students ai literacy and performance in summative assessments. effective ai training for students, supervised use of these tools, and continuous professional development for educators are paramount to successful implementation. addressing the current limitations of ai has the potential to further improve academic writing, foster critical thinking, and ensure responsible application in patient care, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more effective nursing education."

ISMAILOVA2022463,Applicative approach to construe a computational model of concepts and individuals,"this paper considers the application of conceptual mathematics to construct a computational model of concepts and individuals. an applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. the nature of concepts what concepts are and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. it is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. the current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. the deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. the main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. despite this conceptual minimalism, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis."
ATAPATTU2019103594,Detecting cognitive engagement using word embeddings within an online teacher professional development community,"research states that effective teacher professional development (pd) engages teachers as active learners and co-creators of content. however, it is yet to be known whether such pedagogy impacts on cognitive engagement. we adopt the icap framework to measure cognitive engagement in a teacher pd massively open online course (mooc). we use word embeddings to automate the identification of teachers community contributions as representing active engagement by manipulating course materials, or constructive engagement through the generation of new knowledge. we explored individual variation in engagement across units. our findings demonstrated that the participants cognitive engagement is influenced by the nature of mooc tasks. we adopted a manual content analysis approach to explore constructive contributions. from 67 cases considered, all but one case was identified as containing constructive knowledge, providing a solid basis for replicating our proposed methodology to analyse cognitive engagement within the community-centric mooc models."
OYGARDSLIA201861,"“Move over, I will find Jerusalem”: Artifacts in game design in classrooms","when game design is conducted in classrooms as a learning activity, the students usually have digital, as well as traditional, artifacts available. this article looks at how students organize the use of different artifacts when creating computer games about historical topics. the data informing this article consist of video data collected from one sixth-grade class and one seventh-grade class in norway. a sociocultural perspective is used to show how the students use a combination of different artifacts as resources in the game design process, focusing on how students take epistemic stances and how the artifacts are given different epistemic status. the students jointly construct knowledge that they then integrate into computer games using artifacts such as textbooks, world maps, google, and timelines. the article shows how designing games about historical topics is a complex process in which students use artifacts as the basis for knowledge claims and storytelling, and students need to negotiate and balance their own design preferences with historical accuracy and the expectations of the classroom setting."
KELLY20188,BlockyTalky: New programmable tools to enable students’ learning networks,"networked systems like social media and games are ubiquitous in the lives of young people. yet no currently available programming tools exist that have been specifically created to enable youth to create such systems. similarly, industrial and academic programming practices often involve the simultaneous production and subsequent integration of code by multiple collaborators. but few youth-focused programming tools have been designed to support this form of authentic participation in computing. we describe the design of a new programming environment that addresses both of these needs. it empowers adolescents to design, make, and program interactive, tangible networked technologies, indicating the feasibility of networked technology as a design and programming genre for youth. we show how distributed programming tools can offer young people agency to work within a variety of collaboration structures. we present results from two u.s. middle school classroom implementations. students created a wide variety of projects that included interaction design, physical artifact design and making, and network programming. students enacted a variety of collaboration approaches that were responsive to their creative goals and inter-personal relationships. they programmed a system of small single-board computers that process input and output information from connected sensors, actuators, or synthesizers, and communicate over a network. students constructed different collaborative structures, from pair to jigsaw programming. our contribution is to show what the technical content and social structure of future computing education environments for youth could be."

GOOD201778,"Programming language, natural language? Supporting the diverse computational activities of novice programmers","given the current focus on teaching computational concepts to all from an early age, combined with the growing trend to empower end users to become producers of technology rather than mere consumers, we consider the issue of computational notation. specifically, where the goal is to help individuals develop their understanding of computation andor use computation in real world settings, we question whether natural language might be a preferred notation to traditional programming languages, given its familiarity and ubiquity. we describe three empirical studies investigating the use of natural language for computation in which we found that although natural language provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. we distilled our findings into a set of design guidelines for novice programming environments which consider the ways in which different notations, including natural language, can best support the various activities that comprise programming. these guidelines were embodied in flip, a bi-modal programming language used in conjunction with the electron toolset, which allows young people to create their own commercial quality, narrative based role- playing games. two empirical studies on the use of flip in three different real world contexts considered the extent to which the design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation. the guidelines have potential to be of use both in analysing the use of natural language in existing novice programming environments, and in the design of new ones."
LEONE2021103650,Advanced modelling and digital manufacturing: Parametric design tools for the optimization of UHPFRC (ultra high-performance Fiber reinforced concrete) shading panels,"the industry 4.0 production scenarios are determining a paradigm shift in the design of building components. the growing trend of orienting technological innovation in the building sector towards the eco-efficiency of industrial manufacturing processes increasingly requires to identify methods and tools able to support the designmanufacturingconstruction process as a whole. in this sense, the intellectual and operational dimension of design is discovering a new digital and data-driven technological paradigm. digital tools are pushing the investigation of the building component manufacturing process into an increasingly virtual dimension, in which the constant integration between environmental and materialgeometric parameters identifies the meta-design phase as the ideal place to experiment the creative use of data and technical knowledge. starting from these assumptions, the paper illustrates an original design methodology and the related digitalparametric workflow aimed at optimizing performances and production of a faade shading system realized in uhpfrc (ultra high-performance fiber reinforced concrete). the workflow described in this paper includes all the constraints arising from production and the assembly aspects of the components and, with the support of genetic algorithms, aims to improve indoor thermal comfort and indoor daylight performance while containing costs."
HORVATH2024593,"AI for conceptual architecture: Reflections on designing with text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image generators","in this paper we present a research-through-design study where we employed text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image generative tools for a conceptual architecture project for the evolo skyscraper competition. we trained these algorithms on a dataset that we collected and curated, consisting of texts about and images of architecture. we describe our design process, present the final proposal, reflect on the usefulness of such tools for early-stage design, and discuss implications for future research and practice. by analysing the results from training the text-to-text generators we could establish a specific design brief that informed the final concept. the results from the image-to-image generator gave an overview of the shape grammars of previous submissions. all results were intriguing and can assist creativity and in this way, the tools were useful for gaining insight into historical architectural data, helped shape a specific design brief, and provoked new ideas. by reflecting on our design process, we argue that the use of language when employing such tools takes a new role and that three layers of language intertwined in our work: architectural discourse, programming languages, and annotations. we present a map that unfolds how these layers came together as a contribution to making machine learning more explainable for creatives."
GENNARI2023103006,Design for social digital well-being with young generations: Engage them and make them reflect,"digital well-being traditionally means limiting the effects on individuals of technology abuses. however, in a broader perspective, it can be crucial to consider the pervasiveness of technology, and the effect it can have not only on individuals but also on their peers in the context of diverse everyday-life situations. within this view, which emphasises the social side of digital well-being, the paper argues the need of educating young generations to participate in the making of technology for a social goal and have a reflective attitude towards technology and its impact on society. it, therefore, presents a design toolkit as a means to (i) engage young generations to become active in design for social digital well-being and, thanks to the exposure to how technology works, (ii) reflect deeply on the pros and cons of technology in use in their everyday life. by presenting the results of a study with 24 high-school pupils and their teachers, the paper discusses how a phygital toolkit, which structures the design process, engages them in the rapid prototyping of their own smart things, and how it acts as a proxy for soliciting their own reflections around technology and social digital well-being."

CAO2023140,A data and knowledge-jointly driven multimodal intelligent system for enterprise culture assessment,"based on the rapid development of internet new generation information technology, campus culture has become an important force to promote educational innovation. however, the uneven quality of campus culture teaching is also increasingly exposed. therefore, we propose a set of campus culture intelligent quality assessment feedback system driven by data and knowledge. based on real multi-modal campus culture data, the evaluation system covers different online teaching forms, and can comprehensively consider and measure the core elements of quality evaluation from the perspective of teachers and students, so as to achieve accurate evaluation and feedback of campus culture. this paper proposes to combine emotion computing with big data analysis, construct a theoretical framework of multi-modal emotion analysis from the perspective of multi-spatial fusion, and explore the students learning emotion recognition and intelligent assessment based on multi-modal data fusion. by studying the key issues, logical path and implementation path of multimodal learning emotion analysis in campus culture, this paper reveals the mechanism of student emotion development from the perspective of campus culture, expands the intervention practice of student group emotion, and provides technical support and action guidance for after-school teaching and research on campus culture."
KORTE2024100164,Enhancing artificial intelligence literacy through cross-cultural online workshops,"this article presents the results of a study conducted in collaboration with two universities one in lapland (finland) and the other in hong kong (china) during the development of an international university course on global media education. the objective of the study was to examine international students changing conceptual understanding of artificial intelligence (ai) literacy as part of the course. the need for this study arose from the recent rapid spread of ai across industries, which has connected human learning to machine learning. this requires competence in ai to contribute to future society. five hours of online lectures on ai literacy were delivered during two workshops to students (n 29) from 13 countries with no or limited prior knowledge of the subject in 2021 and 2022. the participants filled out pre- and post-workshop quantitative questionnaires and wrote diaries about their learning process, the development of their understanding of ai-literacy concepts, and their thoughts on the pedagogical approaches used. the quantitative data were analysed using a paired-samples t-test, while the qualitative data were examined using thematic-content analysis. the findings show that the students knowledge of ai and their awareness of the importance of ai literacy and media education increased significantly. further research is needed so that a more appropriate curriculum can be designed for them. we outline some key activities that offer interactive and participatory ways to learn ai in order to assist educators in planning and delivering ai-literacy courses as part of cross-cultural media education."
SHEEHAN2019103601,Parent-child interaction and children's learning from a coding application,"research suggests that children can learn educational concepts from well-designed applications (apps), including foundational science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) concepts. parents may be important for promoting childrens stem learning from touchscreen apps, as parents can help their children learn from other media. however, little research has explored how parents and children use coding apps together for learning, and whether specific parent-child interactions in these contexts promote childrens learning from apps. therefore, we observed 31 parents and their 4.5- to 5.0-year old children playing a coding app together and coded for spatial talk, question-asking, task-relevant talk, and responsiveness. results show that parents and children engaged in high-quality interactions during coding app play, with parents and children exhibiting high responsiveness and task-relevant talk, and parents exhibiting a higher proportion of question-asking and spatial talk compared to their children. importantly, linear regression analyses show that the dyads ability to stay on task during the coding task predicts childrens learning of coding, while question-asking was a negative predictor of childrens learning. these results suggest that coding apps may be a rich context for stem learning, and that specific parent-child interactions can scaffold their childrens learning from stem apps."

CANNADY2019101802,Scientific sensemaking supports science content learning across disciplines and instructional contexts,"science consists of a body of knowledge and a set of processes by which the knowledge is produced. although these have traditionally been treated separately in science instruction, there has been a shift to an integration of knowledge and processes, or set of practices, in how science should be taught and assessed. we explore whether a general overall mastery of the processes drives learning in new science content areas and if this overall mastery can be improved through engaged science learning. through a review of literature, the paper conceptualizes this general process mastery as scientific sensemaking, defines the sub-dimensions, and presents a new measure of the construct centered in scenarios of general interest to young adolescents. using a dataset involving over 2500 6th and 8th grade students, the paper shows that scientific sensemaking scores can predict content learning gains and that this relationship is consistent across student characteristics, content of instruction, and classroom environment. further, students who are behaviorally and cognitively engaged during science classroom activities show greater growth in scientific sensemaking, showing a reciprocal relationship between sensemaking ability and effective science instruction. findings from this work support early instruction on sensemaking activities to better position students to learn new scientific content."

ERIKSSON20189,Makerspace in school—Considerations from a large-scale national testbed,"digital fabrication and making has received a growing interest in formal and informal learning environments. however, many of these initiatives often start from a grassroots perspective, with little coordination on a national level. this paper illustrates and discusses a study from an ongoing large-scale national testbed in sweden named makerspace in schools (makerskola). the project embodies a series of considerations that arise when a maker approach is applied to a geographically widespread national education context. the results of this study are based on an analysis of the extensive project documentation and first-hand experiences from initiating and running a large-scale national testbed in sweden, involving more than 30 formal actors and more than one thousand active partners in a national educational setting. the main contribution of this paper is the identification and discussion of five different considerations that have emerged during the project, and include procurement practices, the teacher and leader perspective, informing national policy making, creating equal opportunities, and progression in digital fabrication."
HOOSHYAR2022116670,GameDKT: Deep knowledge tracing in educational games,"despite the multiple deep knowledge tracing (dkt) methods developed for intelligent tutoring systems and online learning environments, there exists only a few applications of such methods in educational computer games. one key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. in this research, we present a generalizable dkt approach called gamedkt that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. our findings reveal that gamedkt approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated cnn model with accuracy and auc of roughly 85 and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the mlp baseline model by up to 14. when the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the cnn model can achieve more than 70 accuracy. interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to rnn and lstm in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners performance in game tasks."
MCDONALD202239,Undergraduate structural biology education: A shift from users to developers of computation and simulation tools,"the use of theory and simulation in undergraduate education in biochemistry, molecular biology, and structural biology is now common, but the skills students need and the curriculum instructors have to train their students are evolving. the global pandemic and the immediate switch to remote instruction forced instructors to reconsider how they can use computation to teach concepts previously approached with other instructional methods. in this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. there has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. we are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum."

TORRESTORRITI2025103030,An algorithm for processing block diagram models of dynamical systems and an open-source visual-programming simulation tool,"visual diagrammatic programming and block diagrams have been indispensable tools for systems modeling and simulation across research, development, and educational fields for several decades. despite the availability of mature commercial and free software tools, there is a lack of information publicly accessible on algorithms for processing block diagrams that represent dynamical systems and simulate the corresponding models. a gap in the existing literature is the absence of mathematically formal and complete proposals of algorithms for processing block diagrams that are multigraphs containing directed cyclic graphs, and not just simpler directed graphs. the lack of a detailed exposition concerning the practical implementation of such algorithms is also a gap. this gap is likely because the simulation systems based on block diagram descriptions that have become de facto industry standards use proprietary solutions, even if their origins can be traced back to work done in research centers and universities more than seven decades ago. in response to these challenges, this paper summarizes the historical evolution of related paradigms, such as data flow diagrams, signal flow graphs, bond graphs, and block diagrams. we propose a general algorithm for block diagram processing and present an open-source software tool for python that implements a diagrammatic visual programming interface and the proposed block diagram processing algorithm. the key contributions to the field of systems modeling and simulation can be summarized as follows. firstly, the exposition of the algorithm formally proving its correctness, offers transparency which facilitates further research and development in the field, enabling academics and professionals to adapt, enhance, or expand upon the existing capabilities of the tool. secondly, the implementation of a python library and tool released as an open-source solution for simulating signal processing and dynamical systems through block diagrams by integrating the proposed algorithm capable of efficiently handling multigraph representations, including those with directed cyclic graphs. ensuring accessibility of the tool to researchers, developers, and educators fosters innovation, research and empowers educators by providing them with a versatile tool that can be used to teach complex systems modeling and simulation concepts in a practical, hands-on manner across various domains, such as control systems, electrical engineering, and computer science."
CELE2022154,SARS-CoV-2 prolonged infection during advanced HIV disease evolves extensive immune escape,"summary characterizing sars-cov-2 evolution in specific geographies may help predict properties of the variants that come from these regions. we mapped neutralization of a sars-cov-2 strain that evolved over 6 months from ancestral virus in a person with advanced hiv disease in south africa; this person was infected prior to emergence of the beta and delta variants. we longitudinally tracked the evolved virus and tested it against self-plasma and convalescent plasma from ancestral, beta, and delta infections. early virus was similar to ancestral, but it evolved a multitude of mutations found in omicron and other variants. it showed substantial but incomplete pfizer bnt162b2 escape, weak neutralization by self-plasma, and despite pre-dating delta, it also showed extensive escape of delta infection-elicited neutralization. this example is consistent with the notion that sars-cov-2 evolving in individual immune-compromised hosts, including those with advanced hiv disease, may gain immune escape of vaccines and enhanced escape of delta immunity, and this has implications for vaccine breakthrough and reinfections."
PARTHASARATHY2021121104,Overcoming wicked problems and institutional voids for social innovation: University-NGO partnerships in the Global South,"this paper argues that, while universities have a crucial role to play in social innovation by democratizing knowledge, fulfilling that role in the global south requires them to partner with civil society actors such as ngos. with their history of working with the socially disadvantaged, ngos have a unique role in clarifying the nature of demand since social innovation must often address ill-formulated wicked problems. similarly, ngos can fill the institutional voids which limit socioeconomic transactions in the global south. the paper discusses the wicked nature of visual-impairment, which is both widely prevalent and has biopsychosocial attributes i.e., the functional limitations are reinforced by the psychological perceptions of the blind and visually impaired (bvi), and the sociological stigma of impairment. the empirical setting is india where policies for the bvi population are being formulated within a broader framework of social inclusion. the paper investigates how the international institute of information technology bangalore (iiitb) has taken advantage of state policies to embrace an academic mandate which includes social innovation. specifically, it explores iiitbs incubation of the ngo vision empower, and the partnership that has followed, to overcome the neglect of the bvi in science and mathematics education."

ALHUMAID2025,Factors Determining Acceptance of Internet of Things in Medical Education: Mixed Methods Study,"background the global increase in the internet of things (iot) adoption has sparked interest in its application within the educational sector, particularly in colleges and universities. previous studies have often focused on individual attitudes toward iot without considering a multiperspective approach and have overlooked the impact of iot on the technology acceptance model outside the educational domain. objective this study aims to bridge the research gap by investigating the factors influencing iot adoption in educational settings, thereby enhancing the understanding of collaborative learning through technology. it seeks to elucidate how iot can facilitate learning processes and technology acceptance among college and university students in the united arab emirates. methods a questionnaire was distributed to students across various colleges and universities in the united arab emirates, garnering 463 participants. the data collected were analyzed using a hybrid approach that integrates structural equation modeling (sem) and artificial neural network (ann), along with importance-performance map analysis to evaluate the significance and performance of each factor affecting iot adoption. results the study, involving 463 participants, identifies 2 primary levels at which factors influence the intention to adopt iot technologies. initial influences include technology optimism (top), innovation, and learning motivation, crucial for application engagement. advanced influences stem from technology acceptance model constructs, particularly perceived ease of use (pe) and perceived usefulness (pu), which directly enhance adoption intentions. detailed statistical analysis using partial least squaressem reveals significant relationships: top and innovativeness impact pe (.412, p.04; .608, p.002, respectively), and pu significantly influences top (.381, p.04), innovativeness (.557, p.003), and learning motivation (.752, p.001). these results support our hypotheses (h1, h2, h3, h4, and h5). further, the intention to use iot is significantly affected by pe and usefulness (.619, p.001; .598, p.001, respectively). ann modeling enhances these findings, showing superior predictive power (r289.7) compared to partial least squaressem (r286.3), indicating a more effective identification of nonlinear associations. importance-performance map analysis corroborates these results, demonstrating the importance and performance of pu as most critical, followed by technology innovativeness and optimism, in shaping behavioral intentions to use iot. conclusions this research contributes methodologically by leveraging deep ann architecture to explore nonlinear relationships among factors influencing iot adoption in education. the study underscores the importance of both intrinsic motivational factors and perceived technological attributes in fostering iot adoption, offering insights for educational institutions considering iot integration into their learning environments."
HEUNG2025100361,How ChatGPT impacts student engagement from a systematic review and meta-analysis study,"generative artificial intelligence, such as chatgpt, has been increasingly integrated into education to change student learning experience. current empirical studies have mixed results on how chatgpt impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. this systematic literature review and meta-analysis explores whether and how chatgpt impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. we used the prisma method to select, analyze, and report the results. we screened 766 articles from four databases and identified 17 empirical studies with 1735 students for analysis. we compared the effect on student engagement between chatgpt-based and non-chatgpt learning. we found a medium effect size on overall student engagement in chatgpt-based learning in the random effects model. our analyses further suggest that chatgpt-based learning is more effective in fostering student behavioral (medium effective size), cognitive (large effective size), and emotional engagement (medium effective size) than non-chatgpt learning. our findings revealed chatgpt is an effective tool for engaging students in learning. we also suggested three roles chatgpt plays in fostering student engagement: personalized tutoring, programming and technical assistance, and content generation and collaboration. our systematic literature review revealed potential risks and results in student disengagement, such as over-reliance."
GROOTHUIJSEN2024100290,AI chatbots in programming education: Students’ use in a scientific computing course and consequences for learning,"teaching and learning in higher education require adaptation following students inevitable use of ai chatbots. this study contributes to the empirical literature on students use of ai chatbots and how they influence learning. the aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. a mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a mechanical engineering masters program at a eindhoven university of technology in the netherlands. data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students grades. results show that students used chatgpt for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. while students reported advantages of using chatgpt, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from chatgpt usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. the findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of ai tools. complex programming assignments remain appropriate in programming education, but pair programming as a didactic approach should be reconsidered in light of the growing use of ai chatbots."
PAPAVLASOPOULOU201757,"Empirical studies on the Maker Movement, a promising approach to learning: A literature review","the maker movement has gathered much attention recently, and has been one of the fastest-growing topics, due to contemporary technical and infrastructural developments. the maker culture can be described as a philosophy in which individuals or groups of individuals create artifacts that are recreated and assembled using software andor physical objects. typical topics of interest in maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as electronics, robotics, 3d printing, and computer numerical control tools, as well as more traditional activities such as sewing or arts and crafts. scholars and educators have reported a variety of outcomes from the maker movement as an instructional process; however, the lack of a summary of these empirical studies prevents stakeholders from having a clear view of the benefits and challenges of this instructional culture. the purpose of this article is to provide a review of the maker movement approach in order to summarize the current findings and guide future studies. forty-three peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed based on a categorization of their main elements. the results of this survey show the direction of maker movement research during recent years and the most common technologies, subjects, evaluation methods, and pedagogical designs. suggestions for future research include a further investigation into the benefits of using a specific technological tool and analysis of the maker movement approach, particularly in classrooms. these future research efforts will allow us to better indicate which aspects and ingredients of making work better for which circumstances and student groups. the findings will ultimately allow us to form best practices and a unified framework for guidingassisting educators who want to adopt this teaching style."
WEI2021104097,"Assessment of cognitive, behavioral, and affective learning outcomes in massive open online courses: A systematic literature review","this systematic review on massive open online courses (moocs) in higher education examined the research on the assessment of learning outcomes based on 65 peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2019. this study aims to investigate the learning outcomes, related instruments, and assessment characteristics of these instruments in moocs. learning outcomes that were examined in the studies that were reviewed concerned cognitive, behavioral, and affective learning outcomes. twenty-five types of assessment approaches were employed to examine these outcomes and to identify the assessment characteristics. the results indicate that a consideration of the assessment of learning outcomes at the beginning of course design could support the formulation of explicit assessment goals and, in this way, instruct learners to work toward learning outcomes. a combination of knowledge tests and skill tasks can be used to examine cognitive outcomes in a particular mooc. outcome-oriented feedback rubrics are beneficial to support learner essay performance and interpretations of the utilization of rubrics could better guide providers to give peer feedback. a variety of behavioral and affective outcomes reflect multiple aspects of participant learning in moocs, which might contribute to better understanding by teachers and the provision of learning support. furthermore, assessment tasks throughout the course may differ in difficulty and complexity, which could align with different levels of learner motivation. the findings provide a holistic picture of learning outcomes and related assessment instruments in current moocs. curriculum designers and teachers could benefit from this study to consider appropriate learning outcome variables and instruments to apply in their mooc practices. future research might investigate the motivation of learners to participate in a mooc and how this changes during a mooc. this could help mooc designers and teachers to align how learners are motivated, what they want to learn, and what they actually do learn."
YANG2021104057,Can an online educational game contribute to developing information literate citizens?,"this study began with concerns about mis-disinformation in the new media environment as we sought ways to combat unreliable information. we developed an online educational game designed to enhance core media and information literacy competencies and to help young adults become information literate citizens. we examined the games effects on skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills, two of the most important mil competencies. in an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. before treatment, the participants perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. after treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. the results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). in addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participants perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participants perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. these findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource. we extend our discussion to the advantages and limitations of games in fostering learners abilities to evaluate online information."
MILLANO2024101589,Dynamics of a higher-dimensional Einstein–Scalar–Gauss–Bonnet cosmology,"we study the dynamics of the field equations in a five-dimensional spatially flat friedmannlematrerobertsonwalker metric in the context of a gaussbonnetscalar field theory where the quintessence scalar field is coupled to the gaussbonnet scalar. contrary to the four-dimensional gaussbonnet theory, where the gaussbonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional einsteinscalargaussbonnet model, the gaussbonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. for the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. for each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. we perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. we determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. this means that our models can explain the universes early and late-time acceleration phases. consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate."
SANTOS2024e41257,School Maker Environments: a systematic review of makerspaces in K-12 education,"studies on maker practices as new learning strategies in basic education increased significantly in the last decade, indicating the need for a state-of-the-art survey. this systematic literature review analyzes implementing makerspaces in basic education schools. a search was carried out in databases on the literature referring to the theme between 2014 and 2023. a formal research protocol collected 602 articles. after using exclusions criteria, 123 proceeded to a detailed analysis. this investigation allowed answering the following research questions: how are makerspaces implemented and used in schools under what pedagogical aspects are maker practices justified and developed in basic education results indicate that most mapped works address issues related to maker practices at school and active learning methodologies. current studies show proposals or exemplify actions with students, broadening the debate on the effectiveness and limitations of maker activities in the school environment. noteworthy is the importance of teacher training for a better understanding of maker education and a greater affinity for using manual, electrical, and digital tools. the social role of the school makerspace as an environment that promotes inclusion, accessibility, diversity, equity, identity, and empowerment is an emerging theme that requires attention. however, there needs to be more information regarding the management and transformation of school spaces to adequately and safely shelter maker practices, coherently connecting the principles of the maker movement to educational ones, indicating that there is still a vast area of research on this subject."
CACEFFO2022104324,Children's social interactions within a socioenactive scenario,"new ubiquitous technologies and interaction paradigms can play a key role in facilitating social interaction processes among children. a class of systems named enactive aims to support fluid interaction between technology and people via feedback cycles the effect of technology on the human agent is fed back by the human action on the technology based on the use of data sensors. we have extended this concept in a long-term project on socioenactive systems, by emphasizing social aspects in the enactive phenomena. in this article, we investigate how a robot-based experience can promote social behavior among children in an educational context. the study was conducted in workshops with 26 children (45 years old), organized in two groups. the system scenario used a narrative based on an adaptation of the little red riding hood tale to investigate childrens interaction in playing embodied-based situations. data captured from video-recorded workshop sessions were analyzed post hoc using the grounded theory methods. in total, 26 interaction coding were identified, with a high interrater reliability assessed by cohens kappa (k 0.84). our findings indicate that 50.5 of the childrens actions were the result of children-children and group-robot interactions, compared to the 38 of children interacting individually with the robot. this indicates childrens high degree of embodied peer collaboration and initiative to accomplish the tasks in the proposed scenario. these results contribute to inform the design and construction of future socioenactive systems."
XIA2022104582,A self-determination theory (SDT) design approach for inclusive and diverse artificial intelligence (AI) education,"the introduction of artificial intelligence (ai) as a subject in k-12 education is a new and important global strategic initiative, but there is a serious lack of studies in relation to this initiative that address inclusion and diversity of education. self-determination theory (sdt) can explain student engagement from the needs satisfaction perspective. therefore, this project aimed to investigate how sdt-based needs support by teachers and student attributes (gender and achievement level) affect ai learning at secondary school level. it adopted a two-study design, with each study using a 2 2 between-subjects factorial design with student needs support from teachers as one factor and one of the student attributes as the other: gender in study 1 and achievement level in study 2. in both studies, there were two groups sdt-based (teacher needs support) and control (without). the analyses revealed that in the sdt-based program, (1) the students had a more positive perception of ai learning and felt that their needs were satisfied, and (2) there were non-significant differences in ai learning between boys and girls and between high and low achievers. the findings suggest that a focus on needs satisfaction could engage boys and girls, and high and low achievers in ai learning. as they become more engaged, they are likely to gain more confidence, feel that the content is more relevant, and become intrinsically motivated to pursue further ai learning."

SUAZOHERNANDEZ2023139836,Effect of particle size of nanoscale zero–valent copper on inorganic phosphorus adsorption–desorption in a volcanic ash soil,"zerovalent copper engineered nanoparticles (cuenps) released through unintentional or intentional actions into the agricultural soils can alter the availability of inorganic phosphorus (ip) to plants. in this study, we used adsorptiondesorption experiments to evaluate the effect of particle size of 1 cuenps (25 nm and 4060 nm) on ip availability in santa barbara (sb) volcanic ash soil. xray diffraction results showed that cuenps were formed by a mixture of cu metallic and cu oxides (cu2o orand cuo) species, while specific surface area values showed that cuenps25 nm could form larger aggregate particles compared to cuenps4060 nm. the kinetic ip adsorption of sb soil without and with 1 cuenps (25 nm and 4060 nm) followed the mechanism described by the pseudosecondorder (k2 0.451.13 x 103 kg mmol1 min1; r2 0.999, and rss 0.091) and elovich ( 14621.103136.20 mmol kg1 min1; r2 0.984, and rss 69) models. thus, the ratelimiting step for ip adsorption in the studied systems was chemisorption on a heterogeneous surface. adsorption equilibrium isotherms without cuenps were fitted well to the freundlich model, while with 1 cuenps (25 nm and 4060 nm), isotherms were described best by the freundlich andor langmuir model. the ip relative adsorption capacity (kf) was higher with 1 cuenps4060 nm (kf 110.41) than for 1 cuenps25 nm (kf 74.40) and for sb soil (kf 48.17). this study showed that plausible ip retention mechanisms in the presence of 1 cuenps in sb soil were: i) ligand exchange, ii) electrostatic attraction, and iii) coprecipitate formation. the desorption study demonstrated that 1 cuenps4060 nm increased the affinity of ip in sb soil with a greater effect than 1 cuenps25 nm. thus, both the studied size ranges of cuenps could favor an accumulation of ip in volcanic ash soils."
XIAO2025126531,An assessment framework of higher-order thinking skills based on fine-tuned large language models,"proficiency in higher-order thinking skills (hots) is essential for 21st-century students to effectively address complex challenges. assessing hots can increase students awareness of their cognitive abilities and promote the development of advanced cognitive skills. this study proposes an automated assessment approach for hots, to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on experts and are often short-term. the exceptional knowledge base and advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (llms) have prompted academics to extend their application to various areas, where they outperform models limited to specific domains. inspired by this, we propose a framework for the automated assessment of hots using llms, called llm4ha. the framework consists of two distinct models: a text-based exercise classification model constructed from pre-trained bert, and a student hots assessment model based on response data, constructed by fine-tuning pre-trained llms. to validate the performance of our framework, we established a classification rule based on blooms taxonomy for exercise classification. we collected 43,070 exercise data points from 181 undergraduate students, from which exercise text data and response data were obtained. the results demonstrate that llm4ha successfully classifies exercises and assesses students hots. the bert-based classification model outperforms chatgpt-4, and the llms-based fine-tuning model significantly outperforms the rnns-based model. a comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify the causes of this outcome. the findings indicate that the robust knowledge base and sophisticated architecture may be crucial for achieving optimal performance in the hots assessment task. the implementations are available at https:github.comxxiongggllm4ha-mian-0302."
XIE2025126371,Using LLM-supported lecture summarization system to improve knowledge recall and student satisfaction,"large language models (llms) are a useful summarization tool for helping students remember the main ideas and central claims of a lecture. however, due to limitations in current techniques, they are unable to deal with lectures complex structures, which contain multiple knowledge themes. to address this issue, we proposed an original theme-based lecture summary (tls) system that combines graph-based theme segmentation algorithms and llms, consisting of data preparation, theme segmentation, summary generation, and consistency evaluation stages. to assess the effectiveness of the system, an education intervention was implemented using a mixed-methods research design. forty-six undergraduate students took part in an authentic lecture context for eight weeks. the quantitative study used a 2 2 factorial design, with intervention conditions including lecture type (conceptual vs. procedural) and tls-generated summaries (with vs. without). then, eight of the participants were chosen for a focus-group interview to learn about student satisfaction. the study finds that: 1) tls-generated summaries have a significant positive influence on knowledge recall; 2) lecture type has no effect on the intervention outcomes of tls-generated summaries, regardless of whether it is conceptually or procedurally oriented; and 3) tls-generated summaries can increase student satisfaction. the current study broadens the use of llms in authentic educational settings to promote student success."
TAYLOR2010561,Using a Computer Programming Environment and an Interactive Whiteboard to Investigate Some Mathematical Thinking,"scratch is a free graphical programming language designed for children to create their own interactive games, animations, simulations and stories. scratch provides a virtual space where children use some mathematics ideas in order to build their own animated artefacts. this paper reports on some preliminary findings from a research project where two elementary teachers in an urban new zealand school introduced scratch to nine and ten year old children in their classrooms. in each of the classrooms a small number of computers and an interactive whiteboard (iwb) were utilised. this paper uses a case study approach to describe how engagement with scratch and independent use of the iwb enabled children to work collaboratively to solve design challenges. initial results indicate that the scratch program is engaging for children. it created an environment where the children were, by necessity, using problem-solving processes such as goal setting, and generating and testing of ideas. the interactive whiteboard afforded rich opportunities for children to collaborate and share their thinking. some questions and implications for the learning and teaching of elementary school mathematics are explored at the conclusion of the paper."
KONG2025105249,The role of perceived teacher support in students’ attitudes towards and flow experience in programming learning: A multi-group analysis of primary students,"programming education has become essential in primary schools, yet students perceptions vary significantly across different achievement levels. while teacher support is crucial for learning, little is known about how it influences students attitudes and flow experience across different achievement groups in programming education. this study examined the interrelationships among perceived teacher support, students attitudes, and flow experience in programming learning across different achievement levels. data were collected through surveys from 549 students across 43 hong kong primary schools. students were categorised into three groups based on their programming achievement levels: above-average, average, and below-average. a multi-group mediation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between variables. the above-average group showed significantly more positive perceptions across all variables than other groups. students attitudes mediated the relationship between perceived teacher support and flow experience differently across achievement groups. the findings highlight the importance of differentiated teacher support strategies across achievement tiers and suggest that fostering positive attitudes towards programming is crucial for all achievement levels, particularly through enhancing the perceived usefulness of programming."

MORCH2023100697,Makerspace activities in a school setting: Top-down and bottom-up approaches for teachers to leverage pupils' making in science education,"this article addresses the opportunities and challenges of turning a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) classroom into a makerspace for hands-on experimentation with digital tools and materials in science education. in this qualitative case study, over a period of 16 weeks, video data were collected during making activities in an advanced placement science course with 19 pupils aged 1216 years, and interviews were conducted. we combined thematic and interaction analyses of empirical data and identified three themes: 1) engagement and spontaneous concepts, 2) programming and making physical objects, and 3) subject integration. our conceptual framework for the analyses integrated two features of the vygotskian sociocultural theory of learning: concept development as a dialectical process of scientific and everyday concepts and the tool and symbol duality. our findings show that both top-down and bottom-up approaches to integrating school subjects into a makerspace were effective but underused. we illustrate this by mapping pupils shared understanding in a sociotechnical space, visualized as a process of rising to the concrete, which may require teachers scaffolding at different levels of abstraction and use of instructional materials in different modalities."
ISMAILOVA2021317,Prototype Mechanisms for Supporting the Network of Links to Parameterized Data Objects,"the paper considers methods to organize a network of links to parameterized data objects. a data object is an object identified by standard methods, including the network identifiers uri, url and urn. the data objects can be either atomic or have a complex structure, including links to other objects, and this ensures the linking of objects into a network, which can be considered as an information graph. it turns out to be possible to formulate a number of criteria for supporting the integrity of such a structure; the paper proposes language tools to formulate such criteria. an essential feature of this network is the dependence of the objects information content on a number of parameters, first of all, on time. depending on the parameter, the information content of the object can change both with the preservation of the integrity of the structure, and with its damage. the paper considers methods for a parameterized description of objects while maintaining integrity based on the formalism of category theory. the formalization used allows defining two relations between objects and their names (identifiers): access and links. the paper studies the basic properties of such relations and reveals the differences between them. category theoretical means of describing objects require appropriate support tools for practical application. the paper proposes a configuration of support tools for a network of links to parameterized data objects based on a combination of conceptual modeling tools and applicative computing tools. the proposed tools provide basic methods of access to the network of information graphs. an essential feature of the proposed tools is the ability to determine the subjective way of considering the information graph (based on the category of correlations), as well as harmonizing an objective and subjective way of considering. the proposed tools were tested in the development of applied information systems in the field of implementation of the best available technologies (bat)."
ALYASIN2022170047,Novel hybrid classification model for multi-class imbalanced lithology dataset,"deep learning methods and applications assist geologists in predicting and identifying lithologies in different surveys, hence lowering operational costs and uptime. this allows accurate data analysis and completion of scientific research on data obtained at geologically different places. this study used 4 lithologies datasets with high dimensionality and multiclass imbalance problems for analysis and classification. the imbalance of data classification is one of the most important problems facing current data analysis. data imbalance can considerably influence classification performance, especially when dealing with other difficulty variables such as the presence of overlapping class distributions. this impact is especially obvious in multi-class conditions when mutual imbalance relations across classes complicate matters even further. moreover, the problem of high dimensionality can lead to increased computing complexity and overfitting, and thus these issues can affect classification performance. to overcome these problems, we developed a new hybrid deep learning multi-class imbalanced learning method that combines synthetic minority oversampling (smote) to resample the data, and recursive feature elimination (rfe) to identify the most useful predictive features. finally, we believe that our developments can help improve geology research by providing accurate classification and rapid answers about interpreting data obtained in various study areas."

SCHERER2023324,Accountability for the future? International testing and future directions,"international large-scale assessments (ilsas), such as the programme for international student assessment (pisa) and the trends in mathematics and science study (timss), have become vehicles to accountability in educational systems around the world. while these assessments bear great potential to inform educational research, practice, and policy-making, they have several limitations and constraints, especially concerning the level of inferences that can be drawn. this chapter reviews the current trends, key elements, and future directions of ilsas and discusses their potential and limitations. illustrative examples showcase the future directions of international testing."
CANNON2023497,Digital media arts and critical media education: an alchemy of creative literacy practices,"this chapter addresses the importance of critical and creative media education across the curriculum from the primary years of learning onwards. the reading and writing skills associated with print literacy are insufficient for meaningful social participation in the digital age. digital media production and creative media arts, in this instance through film, drama and animation production, are seen as central dimensions of a wider and more relevant conceptualization of literacy. school curricula and expressive practices must evolve to accommodate intermedial communicative modes, digital meaning-making and the complex media and moving image landscapes in which most children and young people in developed countries are immersed."
YIMINGKAO2022107245,Designing and evaluating a high interactive augmented reality system for programming learning,"programming plays a pivotal role in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) education. however, programming concepts and syntax are extremely abstract. we developed an augmented reality (ar)-based learning system to make programming concepts tangible. specifically, we adopted a high interactive ar mode that allows students to freely assemble puzzle cards to compare various 3d animated programming results. this study adopted a quasi-experimental design and recruited 98 fifth graders as participants. three groups, named the high interactive ar, low interactive ar, and the traditional learning (control) groups, were formed. the results revealed that the ar-based instruction, especially the high interactive ar mode, helped the students improve their programming achievements, gain higher learning motivation, reduce their cognitive load, and acquire a high degree of technology acceptance. the interview data mainly showed that the students in the high interactive group attained more positive experiences of assembling puzzle cards to learn programming. our study suggests that using ar technology alone did not facilitate learning motivation, although it did produce better programming achievements compared to the traditional learning. a high interactive design such as puzzle cards is vital for arousing higher motivation, which can in turn facilitate a more in-depth understanding of programming logic."
XIA2018267,A systematic review on teaching and learning robotics content knowledge in K-12,"this paper aims to review high-qualified empirical studies on teaching and learning robotics content knowledge in k-12 and explore future research perspectives of robotics education (re) based on the reviewed papers. after a systematic search in online database via keyword search and snowballing approach, 22 ssci journal papers are included in this review. nine major factors are examined for each paper: sample groups, duration, robot types, robotics content knowledge, study type, intervention approaches, measurement instruments, major findings and instructional suggestions. the results indicate that: (1) most empirical studies were endured less than two months with a small sample size, the largest sample group was elementary school students, and most studies used lego robots; (2) more than half of the studies conducted a non-experimental research design, and observation, questionnaire, interview and evaluation of artifacts are commonly-used measurement instruments; and (3) instructional suggestions proposed in the 22 papers can be clustered into four themes: open environment, targeted design, appropriate pedagogy and timely support. overall, the 22 papers suggest that re shows great educational potential in k-12, however, there are indeed situations in which re did not bring significant improvement in student learning. in view of this, we prospect the future research directions of re and propose that more intervention studies with rigorous research design could be conducted in k-12."
WANG2021100031,An investigation of barriers to Hong Kong K-12 schools incorporating Artificial Intelligence in education,"artificial intelligence in education (aied) has been the focus of significant attention in recent years because of its growing social importance and pedagogical value. in hong kong, an increasing number of k-12 schools are planning or piloting their grassroots aied incorporation practices. however, progress is reportedly slow due to a number of barriers. unfortunately, because of their limited scope, disputed interpretations and contextual irrelevance, current research literature seems to be of limited referencing value in aiding schools to address the issues and overcome the barriers. this paper highlights the necessity of embracing aied as wide-ranging given the current understanding of it as a collective notion. three major directions of aied are identified: learning from ai, learning about ai, and learning with ai. a collective case study, which examined the perceived barriers to aied incorporation in hong kong k-12 schools with different aied directions, was conducted. qualitative data were gathered via ten semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from two schools. ertmers (1999) typology was applied to segregate the barriers. the findings showed that both first-order and second-order barriers existed, although they varied between the cases. it was also found that the barriers did not hinder in isolation but appeared to be interconnected. the findings suggest that schools use differentiated strategies to tackle barriers according to their approach to incorporating aied. moreover, there is a need to trace the links between barriers and prioritise school efforts to remove or reduce them with high linkage. several recommendations for practice are given."
MOUNDRIDOU2024100277,Generative AI tools as educators’ assistants: Designing and implementing inquiry-based lesson plans,"this study investigates the integration of generative ai (genai) tools into educational practices, specifically focusing on the design of inquiry-based learning (ibl) lesson plans. based on a particular ibl framework that synthesizes the core attributes of ibl by combining the strengths of various models, the study explores educators potential utilization of genai tools across the frameworks phases. among other capabilities, genai tools were examined for their support in content creation, assessment and feedback processes, as well as in the design of learning activities and lesson plans. this examination informed the classification of genai tools in this study, organizing them according to their potential utility for educators. these groups and subgroups of tools were then aligned with each phase of the ibl framework, demonstrating their role in achieving the objectives of each phase. several practical examples across different grade levels and disciplines were also provided to highlight their prospective use. the systematic classification of genai tools introduced in this study fills a notable gap in the literature, thus making a valuable contribution to the field of genai in education. additionally, by demonstrating how this classification can be applied as educators craft and deliver ibl lesson plans, the study further contributes by providing guidance on the effective use of these tools in real-world educational contexts."
VALCARCEDEVEER2021160,Approaching informal learning about #feminism on Twitter,"purpose in a socio-educational context impregnated by social networks, feminist organizations and individuals have turned to social media to spread their knowledge. this paper aims to approach how feminist tweets are produced to ignite meaningful informal learning (il) processes. designmethodologyapproach this study uses an interdisciplinary mixed methodology. by using twitter tracking tools, a database has been enabled to catalogue feminist hashtags into topics and categories for further analysis. these data have been contrasted with surveys to the managers of the most followed feminist accounts in spain and catalonia. findings from an educational perspective, the analysed feminist hashtags have been organized in 13 different topic categories. the different propagation processes on twitter tweeting and retweeting imply diverse learning processes. moreover, tweets with complementary information such as images or links generate the most interaction, being the preferred format for il. research limitationsimplications researching with big data in educational sciences is a field in development, and twitter data collection tools are mostly addressed to marketing and economic sectors; thus, free tools with limited services were used, offering the analysis of a brief and concrete situation of a platform in constant change. although this ephemeral data and its relevance does not prevail over time, it has an impact on citizens learning. originalityvalue it is the first study in spain that illustrates the informal education that feminism offers to the community, facing the complexity of measuring twitter with an educational perspective through the use of marketing tools."

PONTUALFALCAO2018161,Participatory methodologies to promote student engagement in the development of educational digital games,"engagement is a fundamental condition for learning, which the outdated educational system is failing to sustain for the current generation of students, born in a world permeated with digital technologies. this article presents an analysis of high school students engagement while playing the roles of programmers and designers of educational digital games in the community of practice of the demults project, which aims to provide an alternative within the traditional educational system. data collection was performed within an ethnographic approach with participant observation, questionnaires and social network interaction, and analysis was based on the constructs of activity theory. four groups of students were identified with similar needs and motivations, each engaged at different levels according to the nature of the tasks, interaction with peers and educators, and personal expectations. results reveal that, even in a supposedly fun and innovative context, the relationship between the object of the activity and the students needs is crucial to promote engagement and learning. identifying and taking into account students needs and expectations is reinforced as an indispensable step in educational interventions."
SZCZUKA2022100460,How do children acquire knowledge about voice assistants? A longitudinal field study on children’s knowledge about how voice assistants store and process data,"voice assistants (vas) are available in the family context and are easy to interact with. due to the opaqueness of these assistants, however, children in particular might be unaware of potential negative consequences (e.g., with regard to privacy). to gain a deeper understanding of childrens knowledge about vas, of how to facilitate knowledge regarding va technology (focusing here on parental interventions), and of how childrens knowledge and understanding affects their communicative behavior towards vas (focusing here on telling a secret to the va), we conducted a longitudinal field study with 16 families (n20 children). the emphasis was on differentiating between how vas store and process data, as both aspects are important for a sophisticated usage but vary in how they are experienced or understood. the qualitative data demonstrated that children draw observable inferences from vas behavior, which explains why children know more about how data is processed than about how it is stored or accessed. our results indicate that parental interventions positively affect childrens understanding of data processing, but that this cannot be transferred to data storage, indicating the need for self-explaining systems. lastly, knowledge about how data is stored negatively predicts the willingness to entrust a secret to the system, which underlines the importance of a basic understanding of how technologies work, also for younger users."
VANDERSTAP2024100551,Supporting adult-learners’ online interaction in computer-mediated learning,"previous studies have revealed numerous benefits of computer-mediated learning, yet the design of such learning programmes are not always supportive for adult-learners. studies show that higher education adult-learners are wary of the digital environment in computer-mediated courses, and hence refrain from online interaction resulting in lower learning outcomes and lower perceived learning satisfaction. without an instructional model that supports adult-learners online interaction, teachers may fall back on traditional in-class teaching in an effort to make up for missed learning opportunities. to remedy this, design principles, specifically supportive for adult-learners, were co-designed into an instructional model reflecting the concentric dynamics that strengthen said programmes. in order to validate and improve the quality of the model a delphi study was carried out among experts (n 8) to evaluate the various components of the model, including its overall supportiveness for adult-learners in computer-mediated learning. the experts were selected based on their expertise and research in blended learning. two evaluative rounds through surveys in the programme crowdtech took place until full alignment of the experts opinions was had. the resulting model is a concentric one, illustrating how activities are best distributed across the online environment and the in-class environment, and how social presence can be evoked. this study provides insights into the design of computer-mediated learning programmes tailored for higher education adult-learners as it closes the gap in literature on instructional models and blended learning design. this validated instructional model may help course designers in designing or improving computer-mediated learning programmes."

WIDJAJA2025111604,A BIM-based intelligent approach to rebar layout optimization for reinforced concrete columns,"this study aims to address inefficiencies and errors in current manual rebar practices within the architecture, engineering, and construction (aec) industry, which contribute to significant rebar waste. the design-bid-build (dbb) project delivery method further exacerbates these issues by hindering effective stakeholder collaboration. by contrast, integrated project delivery and building information modeling (bim) have shown potential for enhanced coordination and waste reduction. yet, the continued reliance on manual rebar modeling in bim highlights a pressing need for intelligent automation. this study presents a novel bim-based algorithm that leverages dynamo for rebar layout optimization and navisworks for automatic clash detection, integrating rebar optimization prior to bim model creation to minimize data exchange errors. the methodology was validated on a continuous-column rebar arrangement, supported by a standardized rebar summary sheet to streamline the optimization and clash-detection process. key findings indicate that this approach significantly reduces working hours while achieving high modeling accuracy compared to traditional manual methods. these results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to transform rebar layout practices, enabling smart, efficient, and sustainable construction through automated clash-free rebar layout generation."
PENALOZAAPONTE2024e00609,Automated entrance monitoring to investigate honey bee foraging trips using open-source wireless platform and fiducial tags,"honey bee foraging is a complex behavior because it involves tens of thousands of organisms making decisions about where to collect pollen and nectar based on the quality of resources and the distance to flowers. studying this aspect of their biology is possible through direct observations but the large number of individuals involved in this behavior makes the implementation of technologies ideal to scale up this type of study. consequently, there is a need for instruments that can facilitate accurate assessments of honey bee foraging at the colony level. to address this need, this work aimed to develop an automated imaging system for monitoring the in-and-out activity of honey bee foragers as they walk through a customized entrance with a camera sensor at the hive entrance. we used apriltags attached to each bees thorax to provide unique identification numbers that allowed the system to track in-and-out events throughout the foraging season of the colony. our design relies on low-cost raspberry pi computers and cameras, along with commercially off-the-shelf components, making it easily reproducible with the open-source documentation provided. we successfully deployed and evaluated our system in six locations, demonstrating consistent results. in this paper, we present the details about the development of the system, data collected from multiple colonies, and post-processing analysis from one of our apiaries. our results highlight the systems effectiveness in monitoring honey bee trips, capturing various behaviors associate with their activities outside the colony, which lay the groundwork for future estimations of foraging distances."
OKONKWO2023191,Synthesis of nested loop exercises for practice in introductory programming,"novice programmers struggle to comprehend specific programming constructs such as arrays, recursion, and loops. one way to address this challenge is to provide practice problems for students in these topics that are considered difficult to comprehend such as nested loops. it is proven that practice aids program comprehension, hence, since it is time consuming to manually create many practice problems; synthesising these problems is an expert artificial intelligence task that is worth investigating. in this paper we present the synthesis of nested loop exercises in python for practice using a context-free grammar. we defined the grammar rules for modeling program templates. algorithms were designed and implemented for the generation of structurally different nested loop exercises based on the defined production rules of the context-free grammar. each program generated consists of two or more looping statements, with a nesting, and the context-free grammar rules also allow for the spawning of infinitely many sub-loops for every loop. we checked for the correctness of the synthesised nested loop programs with an experimental procedure of iteratively supplying these programs to the python interpreter. the first 120,000 iterations returned no syntactic bugs, hence, showing that these programs do compile and have outputs. furthermore, an evaluation of the programs was carried out in a survey with 210 participants (novice and expert programmers). the results of the evaluation show that over 82 of the participants agreed that the synthesised exercises were correctly generated, solvable and can be used as practice exercises for novice programmers in introductory programming modules. 120,000 iterations of synthesised loop programs can be found at: https:tinyurl.comnestedloops2021."
ZHANG202375,Thinking and Practicing Like a Scientist?,"this study aimed to develop a valid and reliable instrument, the mental images of scientists questionnaire (misq), and use the instrument to examine chinese students mental images of scientists characters across school levels, regions, living settings, and gender. the final version of the misq consisted of four constructs: scientists cognitive, affective, lifestyle, and job characters. the results showed that senior high school students gave higher scores for scientists cognitive character construct than junior high and elementary school students did. students from eastern regions, which have a more highly developed economy, gave the highest scores on cognitive and affective character constructs of scientists. students from western regions, which have a less developed economy, had a relatively negative impression of scientists. students images of scientists affective, lifestyle, and job characters were positively correlated with their interests in pursuing scientific careers. future research to explore the relationships between students mental images of scientists characters and students motivation to pursue science-related careers or to engage in scientific practices are recommended."
PRASADPANDEY2025100736,"Exploring STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) toys in kindergarten: Teachers' pedagogical approaches, perspective and effect on Children's brain development: A systematic literature review","this systematic literature review explores pedagogical approaches of kindergarten teachers to facilitate childrens play with stem toys. this review summarises teachers perspectives on the utilisation of stem toys in children studying in kindergarten and describes the outcomes of childrens development resulting from playing with stem toys. the present systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the prisma-2020 checklist. the search engines used were google scholar, pubmed, pubmed central, scopus, and other journal databases including sciencedirect, springer, taylor francis etc. for papers published between 2010 and 2024. these searches yielded 2352 peer-reviewed articles. the application of the selection and rejection criteria led to the formation of a shortlisting 32 papers, following the initial evaluation. the findings revealed the various approaches that teachers can employ during play sessions with stem toys while teaching. kindergarten teachers take on the roles of facilitators and mediators, promote collaborative work, and encourage children to perform experiments and learn from failure. furthermore, the findings of this study revealed that kindergarten teachers generally maintain favourable and constructive perspectives regarding the utilisation of stem toys. the results underscore positive impacts on cognitive abilities of children like problem-solving and critical thinking, and socio-emotional skills like verbal communication from using stem toys. comprehensive teacher training is emphasised to identify methodologies that complement the technology, maximizing teaching-learning benefits for childrens brain development."
WU2025102488,What is the role of learning style preferences on the STEM learning attitudes among high school students?,"stem education research suggests that teaching methods have varying effects on students, contingent on their learning styles, resulting in disparities in stem learning attitudes. a stem learning attitude scale was employed to assess 604 taiwanese 10th grade students. exploratory factor analysis (efa) was conducted on 304 samples, while an additional 307 samples underwent confirmatory factor analysis (cfa). this study developed a stem learning attitude instrument and explored the correlation between students learning styles and stem attitudes using the kolb learning style inventory. the results indicated that students with converger and assimilator learning styles exhibited better stem learning attitudes. in contrast, students with diverger and accommodator learning styles displayed lower stem learning attitudes. consequently, we advocate the inclusion of diverser and accommodator learning styles in the design of stem curricula and emphasize the cultivation of collaboration and communication skills in real-world contexts."
LORSCHEID2019153,From cases to general principles: A call for theory development through agent-based modeling,"virtually all current major social and environmental challenges such as financial crises, migration, the erosion of democratic institutions, and the loss of biodiversity involve complex systems comprising decision-making, interacting, adaptive agents. to understand how such agent-based complex systems function and respond to change and disturbances, agent-based modeling (abm) is increasingly recognized as the main way forward. many motivating examples of agent-based models exist that are realistic enough to successfully support the management of complex systems, but these solutions are case-specific and contribute few general insights into the functioning of systems. general theory, though, is highly needed because we cannot model each system and question. still, across disciplines, a critical mass of expertise has accumulated that could transform abm into a more coherent and efficient approach to discover the functioning of complex social-economic-ecological systems. to this end, we need a cross-disciplinary discussion among researchers and a goal-oriented synthesis to identify the general principles and theories essential to improve our understanding and management of complex systems."

LEPP2025100642,"Does generative AI help in learning programming: Students’ perceptions, reported use and relation to performance","in 2022, the release of chatgpt marked a significant advancement in the use of artificial intelligence (ai) chatbots, particularly impacting fields like computer science and education. the ability to generate code snippets using ai chatbots has introduced new opportunities and challenges in teaching programming. however, there is limited agreement on how students integrate them into their learning processes. this study aims to explore how students utilize ai chatbots in the object-oriented programming course and examine the relationship between chatbot usage and academic performance. to address this, 231 students completed a survey assessing the frequency and manner of chatbot usage. descriptive statistical methods were employed to analyze usage and perceptions, while spearmans correlation was used to investigate the connection between chatbot usage and course performance. results indicated that students primarily relied on ai chatbots for programming tasks. interestingly, students performance negatively correlates with the reported frequency of using these tools. these findings provide valuable insights for programming educators, offering a better understanding of students perceptions and use of ai chatbots. this knowledge can inform strategies for integrating these tools effectively into computer science education."
LI2025104500,The Security Awareness Adventure: A serious game for security awareness training utilizing a state transition system and a probabilistic model,"social engineering attacks target people who lack awareness of security. these attacks have become increasingly threatening to modern software systems, which rely heavily on human interactions. recent studies propose to conduct serious game-based security training against such threats. however, it is challenging to simulate real-world scenarios in serious games, making the training less effective. in this paper, we introduce security awareness adventure, a novel social engineering serious game that allows participants to play the role of attackers and realistically experience the social engineering attack process from the attackers perspective. our game works with state transition models to realistically simulate stakeholder interactions within specific scenarios and to capture stakeholders alternative behaviors using a branching system. to evaluate our games effectiveness, we conducted an experiment with 41 participants and a real social engineering security scenario. the experimental results show that our game can effectively improve the learners security awareness."
RADU2023100008,Charting opportunities and guidelines for augmented reality in makerspaces through prototyping and co-design research,"makerspace environments are becoming popular project-based learning spaces where students interact with physical objects and peer collaboration, while developing 21st century skills and engaging with science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) topics. at the same time, augmented reality (ar) technology, which combines physical objects with digital visualizations, is becoming increasingly applicable for makerspace activities and has potential to address challenges for student learning in makerspaces. however, there is a lack of understanding of how to use and integrate ar in real makerspace environments. in this research we use a co-design methodology to address the following questions: (1) how can ar be useful for education in makerspaces (2) how are students impacted by the process of co-designing ar technology and (3) what are practical considerations for integrating ar in makerspaces we engaged in a co-design process in a semester-long makerspace course attended by 18 students in a graduate school of education. through this process, we generated six prototypes with seven student co-designers, exploring ar use in design, fabrication, programming, electronics, and training. we also identified areas where ar technology can benefit makerspaces, such as teaching stem skills, facilitating construction activities, enhancing contextualization of learning, and debugging. we observed that students participating in co-design demonstrated improved understanding of technology design, enthusiasm for engaging with makerspaces and ar, and increased critical thinking about ar technology. these results suggest considerations and guidelines for integrating ar technology into makerspace environments."

FLORES201825,"Problem-based science, a constructionist approach to science literacy in middle school","this paper describes a four-year observation using a model designed and tested in a middle school maker space, called problem-based science (pbs). pbs was used as the primary model for a middle school science curriculum adapted by the tools and mindsets of the maker movement. pbs is learning through inventing and problem solving while using the latest in fabrication technology, like 3d printers and laser cutters, as well as more traditional making skills, like electronics, robotics, sewing and carpentry. pbs is based on seymour paperts constructionism, set to a science curriculum taught full time in a makerspace or fablab. bridging ideas in design thinking, maker education, and applied math and science, the term problem-based science was used to describe how learning would look, sound, and feel different in a makerspace, when a focus was on learner-centered curriculum. the design and testing of this curriculum took place as part of the 5th and 6th grade science courses offered at a private (non-public) school in california (usa) the fall of 2012, through the spring of 2016. through daily formative assessment, as well as exit surveys, the patterns and benefits of learning in a self-directed learning space, designed for constructionism, were observed. this paper shares the highlights of those years. video taped exit surveys conducted by the author, show that self-direction is both challenging and rewarding, students often felt trusted and respected, even if they did not always feel supported in a manner common in a more teacher directed classroom setting. daily informal classroom observations revealed that using student driven, open-ended problem solving, rather than a 100 teacher led, step by step lab, lends to a more diverse pool of leadership practice in students and higher engagement in hard problems. students typically seen as struggling in traditional classrooms, identified as experts and successful learners in this setting. lastly, using pbs as a model for science literacy allows the youngest of learners to practice mindsets and habits typical of real scientists and inventors, fostering early identify formation in stem fields."

HOLZINGER2019258,Big Data Calls for Machine Learning,"health systems worldwide are confronted with enormous amounts of heterogenous data from various clinical sources. additionally, the trend toward precision medicine, in order to tailor decisions and therapies to the individual patient, generates enormous amounts of omics data. modern medicine is turning into a data science. the problem is that most of these data are in arbitrarily high dimensions, making manual analysis difficult, yet impossible for humans. this requires automated methods of data science, which is what machine learning provides. automatic machine learning methods show impressive results in dealing with big data, because such algorithms can learn from training samples to gain knowledge from experience, thus helping to make decisions and predictions. the more data, the better these algorithms perform. unfortunately, in medicine, we are often confronted with a small number of data sets, little data, rare events, and complex data, where automatic approaches suffer from insufficient training sets. this calls for interactive machine learning with a doctor in the loop, who can be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristic selection of data samples. therefore, what would otherwise be an np-hard problem reduces greatly in complexity through the input and the assistance of a medical professional involved in the machine learning pipeline."
FENG2017150,Parallel programming with pictures is a Snap!,"for decades, computing speeds seemingly doubled every 24 months by increasing the processor clock speed, thus giving software a free ride to better performance. this free ride, however, effectively ended by the mid-2000s. with clock speeds having plateaued and computational horsepower instead increasing due to increasing the number of cores per processor, the vision for parallel computing, which started more than 40 years ago, is a revolution that has now (ubiquitously) arrived. in addition to traditional supercomputing clusters, parallel computing with multiple cores can be found in desktops, laptops, and even mobile smartphones. this ubiquitous parallelism in hardware presents a major challenge: the difficulty in easily extracting parallel performance via current software abstractions. consequently, this paper presents an approach that reduces the learning curve to parallel programming by introducing such concepts into a visual (but currently sequential) programming language called snap, which was inspired by mits scratch project. furthermore, our proposed visual abstractions can automatically generate parallel code for the end user to run in parallel on a variety of platforms from personal computing devices to supercomputers. ultimately, this work seeks to increase parallel programming literacy so that users, whether novice or experienced, may leverage a world of ubiquitous parallelism to enhance productivity in all walks of life, including the sciences, engineering, commerce, and liberal arts."
JACOB2022470,Algorithmic Approaches to Classify Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Research Perspective,"autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a neurodevelopmental disability that exhibits sluggish progress in vocal development, restricted interest in normal activity and repetitive disoriented behavior. this syndrome, has gained a lot of attention due to its prevalence among children across all countries and from different economic backgrounds. however, asd detection and treatment yet remains in its infancy due to the lack of awareness among parents, limited screening of proper developmental milestones and a dearth of diagnostic tools to classify this syndrome with convincing accuracy. recent studies report that scalable biomarkers for early detection have made little progress in research due to the erraticism of this disorder. moreover, the study on developing tools or applications for parents, teachers, and healthcare workers to identify children who exhibit any form of autism is still a work in progress. the research work undertaken in this paper presents an analysis of supervised machine learning algorithms on mining interesting details that link the diverse nature of asd and the possibility of computationally detecting markers for the syndrome. the preliminary findings on the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms in asd classification is reported with the possibility of integrating deep learning architectures for asd detection and therapy."
HAKIM2024,Digital Gamification Tools to Enhance Vaccine Uptake: Scoping Review,"background gamification has been used successfully to promote various desired health behaviors. previous studies have used gamification to achieve desired health behaviors or facilitate their learning about health. objective in this scoping review, we aimed to describe digital gamified tools that have been implemented or evaluated across various populations to encourage vaccination, as well as any reported effects of identified tools. methods we searched medline, embase, cinahl, the web of science core collection, the cochrane database of systematic reviews, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, academic search premier, psycinfo, global health, and eric for peer-reviewed papers describing digital gamified tools with or without evaluations. we also conducted web searches with google to identify digital gamified tools lacking associated publications. we consulted 12 experts in the field of gamification and health behavior to identify any papers or tools we might have missed. we extracted data about the target population of the tools, the interventions themselves (eg, type of digital gamified tool platform, type of diseasevaccine, type and design of study), and any effects of evaluated tools, and we synthesized data narratively. results of 1402 records, we included 28 (2) peer-reviewed papers and 10 digital gamified tools lacking associated publications. the experts added 1 digital gamified tool that met the inclusion criteria. our final data set therefore included 28 peer-reviewed papers and 11 digital gamified tools. of the 28 peer-reviewed papers, 7 (25) explained the development of the tool, 16 (57) described evaluation, and 2 (7) reported both development and evaluation of the tool. the 28 peer-reviewed papers reported on 25 different tools. of these 25 digital gamified tools, 11 (44) were web-based tools, 8 (32) mobile (native mobile or mobile-enabled web) apps, and 6 (24) virtual reality tools. overall, tools that were evaluated showed increases in knowledge and intentions to receive vaccines, mixed effects on attitudes, and positive effects on beliefs. we did not observe discernible advantages of one type of digital gamified tool (web based, mobile, virtual reality) over the others. however, a few studies were randomized controlled trials, and publication bias may have led to such positive effects having a higher likelihood of appearing in the peer-reviewed literature. conclusions digital gamified tools appear to have potential for improving vaccine uptake by fostering positive beliefs and increasing vaccine-related knowledge and intentions. encouraging comparative studies of different features or different types of digital gamified tools could advance the field by identifying features or types of tools that yield more positive effects across populations and contexts. further work in this area should seek to inform the implementation of gamification for vaccine acceptance and promote effective health communication, thus yielding meaningful health and social impacts."
SCREPANTI2022267,Control Engineering and Robotics since Primary School: an Infrastructure for creating the Digital Twin model of the Learning Class.,"control engineering has a cross-boundary nature because its applications span over a wide range of fields, among which science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem). creating an automation literacy from the primary schools age is beneficial for pupils because it supports the development of valuable skills that allow the comprehension and analysis of real-world phenomena. even if many researchers and policymakers have advocated for engineering education since early education, it is usually kept for undergraduate and graduate-level education. what prevents systems theory and control education from being integrated into k12 education is the lack of available educational resources and the lack of indicators to represent the learning gain of students. to help teachers in the latter aspect, a solution can be studying the entire process as a cyber-physical human system (cphs). the paper consists of a brief report about the work carried out by authors to represent the entire classroom as a cphs where the physical robots designed by students, humans (teachers and learners), and cybertechnologies are interconnected to accomplish a goal which is learning. the entire infrastructure could be seamlessly deployed into the classroom, supporting learning assessment and the feedback process starting from the deployment of a (quasi) real-time intelligent collection system."

LIU2025105263,Eye tracking technology for examining cognitive processes in education: A systematic review,"eye-tracking studies have been increasingly used to investigate student cognitive processes. while some existing literature has reviewed commonly used eye-tracking measures and analytical methods across different contexts, there remains a gap in clarifying the educational themes, cognitive theories, and specific cognitive processes most frequently examined in recent eye-tracking studies. to address this, this review synthesizes recent educational eye-tracking research analyzing student cognitive processes from january 2012 to november 2024. in total, 313 articles were reviewed, and several main findings emerged: (1) the majority of eye-tracking studies examined the themes of multimedia learning, reading performance, and problem-solving, while fewer focused on second language learning, computer-based tests, and individual differences. (2) about half of the studies were conducted under one or more theories, with cognitive load theory (clt), cognitive theory of multimedia learning (ctml), and dual-coding theory (dct) being the most frequently applied. (3) eye-tracking data were primarily collected from college students, and temporal and count measures were typically used to investigate the cognitive process of information organization rather than those of information selection and integration. (4) basic statistical methods and linear mixed models were widely used to analyze student attention differences. the results of this review provide theoretical and practical insights into the strengths and challenges of using eye-tracking technology to assess the impact of pedagogical interventions in computer-based learning environments."
VALERI2025100360,Exploring students’ experience of ChatGPT in STEM education,"the rapid advances in ai technologies showed a disruptive potential in educational practices, presenting new challenges and generating new opportunities. this phenomenon has been exacerbated since the release of chatgpt in 2022, which has permanently transformed various educational activities and sparked widespread scientific interest. research suggests that chatgpt can help students navigate the complexities of stem subjects. however, only a few studies have directed attention to the use of chatgpt in stem subjects in upper secondary education. with the purpose of addressing this gap, the aim of this study is to explore how students experience chatgpt for their stem studies, encompassing their usage, perceptions, and general knowledge about this technology. using a mixed methods approach, the data collected included a survey and semi-structured interviews involving upper secondary students. the results show widespread adoption of chatgpt across stem subjects among participants, particularly in biology and especially as a tool to support the understanding of concepts. although students exhibited limited knowledge of ai, they demonstrated some effective prompting strategies to generate relevant content and tackle potential inaccuracies and hallucinations. the findings in this paper provide insights to support the exploration of students experiences of chatgpt, presenting relevant topics to further research the applications of these ai technologies within stem subjects, given their importance for future societal development."

MAGANA2016427,A case study of undergraduate engineering students' computational literacy and self-beliefs about computing in the context of authentic practices,"engineering students, as compared to computing-related majors, are not traditionally introduced to computing in the context of authentic learning experiences, i.e., real-world applications within their discipline. this paper identifies the impact of computation delivered by authentic learning experiences in the form of anchored instruction on students self-beliefs and their capacity to leverage computation to acquire disciplinary concepts in subsequent computationally-based engineering coursework. this case study included 130 students with different programing preparation (authentic or traditional), who were exposed to computational learning modules. control-value theory of achievement emotions is the conceptual framework that guided the evaluation of this investigation. measures included student self-beliefs such as control and value appraisals, and their relationship with academic performance. results suggest that programming preparation presented in an authentic engineering context provides an important foundation that goes beyond increasing students control self-beliefs. this preparation seems to effectively enable students to leverage computational practices for the purpose of acquiring disciplinary concepts. implications for teaching relate to the integration of computation sooner, more often and within a disciplinary context in the undergraduate engineering curriculum. implications for learning relate to fostering engineering computational literacy guided by anchored instruction to support disciplinary problem solving."

BRANDLE2023e19516,"Self-assessments, attitudes, and motivational orientations towards the use of digital media in teaching a comparison between student teachers of different subject clusters","findings from research on the education of teachers show that student teachers lack competence in the utilization of digital media and often fail to see the added value in using digital concepts in classrooms. teacher training institutions are faced with the central challenge of providing student teachers and teachers with adaptive learning opportunities for their competence in digital areas. in the context of various teaching subjects, this raises questions about specific starting points and the actual needs of students, as well as university course offerings. the present study tackles this topic and explores the commonalities and differences between student teachers from three subject clusters: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem); language literature arts (lla); and social sciences (socs). the questionnaire-based study examines student teachers self-assessments of their abilities in terms of digital media, attitudes, and motivational orientations towards the use of digital media in teaching. group comparisons show that stem student teachers rate themselves better in competence facets such as technological knowledge, technological content knowledge, and technological pedagogical knowledge, although their attitudes and motivation towards learning with digital media do not differ. despite the different interrelation effects of investigated influencing factors on motivation depending on subject clusters, the findings suggest the promotion of technological competencies and positive attitudes to increase motivation."
FENG2023e16237,Effects of gender diversity on college students’ collaborative learning: From individual gender to gender pairing,"this study investigated the effects of gender and gender pairing on behaviors and social interaction during collaborative learning in a blended learning environment. three types of pairing (all-female, all-male, and mixed) were considered in an empirical study with 44 undergraduate students. the results revealed that, first, female students were more likely to perform well in listening, talking, and integrating during class, and in the quality of posts after class, whereas male students tended to engage more in irrelevant behavior in collaboration. second, same-gender groups were more active in collaborative discussion, but all-male groups performed worst in quality of posts after class. third, both male and female students were more active in same-gender groups than in mixed groups. finally, same-gender groups tended to have greater interpersonal connectedness than mixed-gender groups. the paper ends with a list of practical implications for facilitating effective collaborative learning in co-educational college classrooms."
LOH2025105195,Plugging in at school: Do schools nurture digital skills and narrow digital skills inequality?,"information and communication technology (ict) have become indispensable in contemporary schools in post-industrialized countries. whether schools have succeeded in vesting students with the needed digital skills important in todays highly digitalized societal landscape however remains unclear. in this paper, we examine whether school resources in terms of ict infrastructure, use of ict in education, and availability of technical expertise are pertinent to students digital skillfulness. we also investigate whether such school ict resources are unevenly distributed among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether students of different socioeconomic backgrounds unevenly benefit from these resources. in doing so, we illuminate school ict resources role in the process of intergenerational transmission of inequalities. to test our expectations, we employ icils 2018 data on 14,183 students in 751 schools across seven oecd countries. our findings indicate that schools indeed play a meaningful role in nurturing digital skills, namely through students use of ict in educational tasks. we also find that students from more advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds more often attend well ict-resourced schools, pointing at the uneven distribution of school ict resources in a way that reflects social reproduction processes. alongside that, the availability of technical expertise in schools seems particularly fruitful for low-ses students digital skills development. this evinces that schools compensate for limited ict skills socialization in the family, pointing at social mobility processes."
BUSTAMANTEBARRETO20232,Changes in Colombian and Korean Teachers’ Self-Efficacy from talis 2018 and its Current Relation with Teacher Digital Competencies,"this study explores the relationship between teacher digital competencies (tdc) and teacher self-efficacy (tse), which affects student outcomes and academic success. with the increasing use of technology in education, the covid19 pandemic highlighted the need for effective use of technology in classrooms. this research examines if tse and other factors such as sociodemographic and school characteristics explain tdc for korean and colombian teachers. the study also compares tse levels before and after the pandemic. results show that tse, sociodemographic factors, and school characteristics explain colombian tdc, whereas only tse explains korean tdc. colombian teachers had higher tse than korean teachers before and after the pandemic. while tse levels decreased for both countries, there was a surprising increase in the means for tse related to ict. this study highlights the need for further research on tse and tdc in different societies."
PARK2025,Development and Validation of the Digital Sensitivity Scale for Adults: Cross-Sectional Observational Study,"background the covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of modern society, extending digital transformation to daily life and psychological evaluation and treatment. however, the development of competencies and literacy in handling digital technology has not kept pace, resulting in a significant disparity among individuals. existing measurements of digital literacy were developed before widespread information and communications technology device adoption, mainly focusing on ones perceptions of their proficiency and the utility of device operation. in the contemporary landscape, digital transformation is evolving within specialized domains, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of digital competencies, attitudes, and proficiency in technology application to bridge the digital divide and ensure digital compliance. objective this study was designed to address the shortcomings of existing scales and formulate a digital sensitivity scale tailored to the requirements of todays society. methods initial items of the yongin severance digital sensitivity scale (yi-dss) were collected through a literature review, and expert opinions were gathered to ensure content validity. an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis included 986 adult participants evaluating 14 digital literacy items and 6 digital efficacy items. the cronbach confirmed internal consistency reliability, and 2-tailed t tests, anovas, and post hoc tests analyzed demographic differences in digital literacy and efficacy. results a robust 4-factor digital literacy solution was identified: digital application, digital communication, critical thinking, and digital ethics (kaiser-meyer-olkin0.891; bartlett 29829.713; p.001; cronbach 0.782-0.947). a 2-factor solution defined digital efficacy: digital confidence and digital anxiety (kaiser-meyer-olkin0.735; bartlett 23282.217; p.001; cronbach 0.787-0.912). confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for each model (digital literacy model: 271676.0, comparative fit index0.938, tucker-lewis index0.921, standardized root mean square residual0.73, and root mean square error of approximation0.093; digital efficacy model: 2881.9, comparative fit index0.977, tucker-lewis index0.958, standardized root mean square residual0.73, and root mean square error of approximation0.097), which indicated a good fit. the yi-dss also showed high correlation with the previously developed digital literacy scale (r0.809; p.001). conclusions the yi-dss, as a self-assessment tool, has the potential to bridge the generational information gap by promoting acceptance, motivation, and adaptation to digital technology. furthermore, given the remote nature of digital therapeutics, an individuals familiarity with required technologies and digital communication strongly influences their acceptance of digital treatments and the efficacy thereof. this scale can play a pivotal role in enhancing compliance with digital therapeutics by preemptively assessing individuals technological literacy and competency."
OCONNOR2023107963,Exploring the impact of augmented reality on student academic self-efficacy in higher education,"this study develops and empirically tests a conceptual model comprising eight hypotheses that focus on the impact of augmented reality (ar) on student academic self-efficacy. a controlled experiment was conducted, followed by an online questionnaire with 65 students. partial least square (pls) structural equation modelling (sem) is used to assess and test the model. the results show that student cognitive strategies impact student perception and engagement with technology and learning tasks, with ar positively impacting student academic self-efficacy in higher education. interestingly, neither the learning space nor the students perception of task value was shown to impact their intention to use ar. instead, it was the characteristics of the technology itself which encouraged adoption. the studys findings reinforce the need to (1) teach and facilitate effective cognitive strategies among third level students and (2) identify and overcome negative cognitive strategies that harm student self-efficacy and engagement."
OLARI2024100196,Data-related concepts for artificial intelligence education in K-12,"due to advances in artificial intelligence (ai), computer science education has rapidly started to include topics related to ai along k-12 education. although this development is timely and important, it is also concerning because the elaboration of the ai field for k-12 is still ongoing. current efforts may significantly underestimate the role of data, the fundamental component of an ai system. if the goal is to enable students to understand how ai systems work, knowledge of key concepts related to data processing is a prerequisite, as data collection, preparation, and engineering are closely linked to the functionality of ai systems. to advance the field, the following research provides a comprehensive collection of key data-related concepts relevant to k-12 computer science education. these concepts were identified through a theoretical review of the ai field, aligned through a review of ai curricula for school education, evaluated through interviews with domain experts and teachers, and structured hierarchically according to the data lifecycle. computer science educators can use the elaborated structure as a conceptual guide for designing learning arrangements that aim to enable students to understand how ai systems are created and function."
RUBACH2024190,High school,"high school is a part of secondary schooling and is often the final stage of compulsory schooling. high school plays a crucial role in providing students with mandatory competencies and an educational degree that provides them access to postsecondary education. in this article, we discuss four broad topics related to high school: international perspectives on the structure of high school; adolescents development in high school related to their needs and experiences; inequality based on gender, ethnicity, and race; and the importance of teachers. we frame the article using stage-environment fit theory and situated expectancyvalue theory."

NETO2025103459,"Investigating crossmodal correspondences between vibrotactile stimuli, colour, and emotions","there is an increasing interest in humancomputer interaction in multisensory interactive systems, creating a need to deepen our understanding of how multiple sensory modalities relate to and affect each other. we extend prior research on crossmodal correspondences by investigating colour and emotional associations with pure vibrotactile stimuli. we asked 32 participants to assign colour properties (hue and brightness) and emotional categories (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) to stimuli of varying amplitude and angular frequency. we found that perceptions of pleasure and arousal increased with amplitude and angular frequency, but negative and relaxing emotional states were not able to convey. we also found associations between vibrotactile stimuli and colour properties. high amplitude stimuli were linked to warm colours and darker shades, while low amplitude was associated with brighter shades and greater variance in hue. we finish by discussing the causal mechanisms of crossmodal correspondences and contribute a design space for creating multisensory experiences."
ARSEVEN2025101850,Critical literacy in artificial intelligence assisted writing instruction: A systematic review,"this systematic review aims to examine the relationship between artificial intelligence (ai)- assisted writing instruction and critical literacy skills of k-12 students. as a result of searching web of science (wos), scopus, education resources information center (eric), and ebsco databases in accordance with the criteria determined, 15 studies were included in the analysis. as a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the ai-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. our findings show that students use ai tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. students question ai outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. the findings of our study reveal that ai-assisted writing experiences increase students ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. however, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field."
TASGIN2023101400,The mediating role of critical thinking dispositions between secondary school student's self-efficacy and problem-solving skills,"this research examines whether critical thinking dispositions significantly mediate secondary school students self-efficacy and problem-solving skills. the sample of the study consisted of a total of 304 secondary school students. study data were obtained by using the problem-solving skills perception scale for secondary school students, critical thinking disposition scale for secondary school students, and middle school self-efficacy scale. it was examined whether the scores of the variables in the study were normally distributed. after it was understood that the data were normally distributed, the analyses were conducted. the relationships between the variables were analyzed with pearson product moment correlation analysis and significant relationships were found between the variables. then, a mediation model was established to analyze whether critical thinking has a mediating role in the relationship between middle school students self-efficacy and problem-solving skills. the significance of the indirect effect in this mediation model was tested by the bootstrapping procedure. in the study, it was concluded that all variables were positively and significantly related to each other and critical thinking significantly mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and problem-solving skills in secondary school students."
WU2024104376,Validating the AI-assisted second language (L2) learning attitude scale for Chinese college students and its correlation with L2 proficiency,"the positive impact of artificial intelligence (ai) on second language (l2) learning is well-documented. an individuals attitude toward ai significantly influences its adoption. despite this, no specific scale has been designed to measure this attitude, particularly in the chinese context. to address this gap, our study aims to construct the ai-assisted l2 learning attitude scale for chinese college students (al2as-ccs) and evaluate its reliability, validity, and relationship with l2 proficiency. our research comprises two phases, each involving separate samples. in phase one (sample 1: n 379), we conducted exploratory factor analysis (efa) to determine the factor structure of the al2as-ccs. the resulting two-factor structure consists of 12 items, categorized into cognitive and behavioral components. in phase two (sample 2: n 429), we performed confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) to validate the factor structure and assess model fit. cfa in sample 2 confirmed the factor structure and demonstrated a good model fit. additionally, the al2as-ccs exhibited high criterion validity, internal consistency, and cross-gender invariance. our findings suggest that the al2as-ccs is a valid measurement tool for assessing chinese college students attitude toward ai-assisted l2 learning. moreover, chinese college students were discovered to maintain a moderately positive attitude toward ai-assisted l2 learning. additionally, a positive correlation was identified between this attitude and their l2 proficiency."

ELLERTON2022100975,On critical thinking and content knowledge: A critique of the assumptions of cognitive load theory☆,"how critical thinking is understood has a logical impact on pedagogy and curriculum design in a critical thinking education. if critical thinking is seen as a complex mix of knowledge, skills and dispositions that can be articulated and made an object of study in themselves, then there is scope for intentional and explicit targeting of such things. if, however, critical thinking is seen as a general skill more or less impermeable to pedagogical influence and best realised through the development of content knowledge, then an explicit focus on developing thinking skills is misplaced and potentially distracting. the latter view is that of cognitive load theory (clt), a theoretical framing of thinking and learning that has gained traction in education including with practitioners. this paper will explore some of the assumptions of clt and show that they are either (1) in error, (2) vaguely or confusingly expressed andor (3) the conclusions drawn within the theory are often errors of inference. moreover, i point out that important educational research that weakens the claims of clt is often not engaged with or addressed."
LIN2025102570,Effects of personalized approach on fourth-grade students’ academic performance in project-based learning,"project-based learning (pjbl) has become a popular teaching method for 21st-century learning; however, academic performance improvement is a challenge. this study proposes a framework for designing personalized project-based learning (p-pjbl) experiences. to evaluate the effectiveness of p-pjbl, this study was conducted in two stages. in the first stage, a two-tier diagnostic test was developed using data from over 1,000 students. subsequently, students prior knowledge and understanding were assessed through the diagnostic test, and personalized activities and resources were created based on the test results. in the second stage, 106 fourth-grade students were divided into three groups and participated in a three-period unit. control group 1 followed traditional teaching methods, control group 2 engaged in general project-based learning (g-pjbl), and the experimental group used p-pjbl. the results indicated that p-pjbl can effectively improve academic performance and reduce the student performance gap. notably, p-pjbl had a more positive effect on students with moderate prior knowledge than those with limited prior knowledge. moreover, students with higher-level prior knowledge demonstrated greater improvement in p-pjbl than those with low-level prior knowledge. these findings provide valuable insight into the potential benefits of p-pjbl for improving academic performance."

BAIJNATH2023279,Implications of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the vortex of higher education in South Africa,"the paper explores the genesis and potential of the 4ir, and what it portends for a developing economy and society such as south africa and its impact on the global stage. it reflects on the value that is promised for tertiary education, teaching, and learning. separating hype from the realistic possibilities, the connections between advances in technology, policy, and development challenges are critically examined to consider how the 4ir could impact on tertiary education, and teaching and learning, in the future. it then proceeds to examine the enabling conditions which need to be cultivated at national, institutional, and individual levels, and the challenges and obstacles to be overcome at these levels, for enduring benefits to be realized. the paper explores what the phenomenon of the 4ir is, drawing on the arguments of key proponents, including skeptics. it explores what kinds of changes are envisaged as the phenomenon progresses. it then proceeds to examine how institutions may be positioned to harness the 4ir for the benefit of human wellbeing, and in support of national and international social and economic benefits. the promise of the 4ir to resolve our developmental challenges has been sharply questionedperhaps being overhyped, given existing and enduring disadvantage and marginalization that was not ameliorated in previous industrial revolutions. these are elaborated upon. at the institutional level, more sophisticated use of digital technology is called forin administration, teaching, learning support, and e-learning. online data and information management; aggregation of vast amounts of data; and analyses of data for student success and student support promise a positive impact on success and throughput rates. key imperatives for action include redesigning, streamlining, and aligning the education system. this requires flexibility in admission criteria, curriculum design, learning and teaching modes, and assessment, with appropriate support systems and services across the institution."
NG2022100054,Using digital story writing as a pedagogy to develop AI literacy among primary students,"artificial intelligence (ai) literacy is widely recognized as a new set of competencies that people use ai effectively and ethically in everyday life. in k-12 education, educators have started to employ different pedagogical strategies to foster students ai literacy. using digital story writing (dsw) in the classroom is an effective inquiry-based pedagogical approach to address literacy development by improving language and technological abilities across disciplines. this study recruited 82 primary students in hong kong to attend a three-month dsw journey to learn ai and completed a knowledge test at the end of the program. among the students, 16 best-achieving students were further invited to participate in artefact-based interviews, and we further analysed their work to understand how they formulate ai understandings. it is found that the participating students were able to propose an authentic scenario, apply their new knowledge of ai and think up meaningful ai-driven solutions in their digital stories. furthermore, we examined students dsw process in terms of inquiry-based pedagogical cycle (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion) to demonstrate how they learn ai. overall, dsw as an inquiry could effectively foster students ai literacy in using and applying ai knowledge to solve real-life problems, far beyond merely knowing and understanding related concepts. we suggest that using dsw as a pedagogy has the potential to support students to scaffold students ai understanding, particularly for young children."
LANGER2023105230,Ethical considerations in child-robot interactions,"social robots hold promise in augmenting education, rehabilitative care, and leisure activities for children. despite findings suggesting various benefits of social robot use in schools, clinics, and homes, stakeholders have voiced concerns about the potential social and emotional effects of children engaging in long-term interactions with robots. given the challenges of conducting large long-term studies of child-robot interaction (cri), little is known about the impact of cri on childrens socio-emotional development. here we summarize the literature on predictions and expectations of teachers, parents, therapists, and children regarding the effects of cri on childrens socio-emotional functioning and skill building. we then highlight the limited body of empirical research examining how cri affects childrens social behavior and emotional expression, and we provide a summary of available questionnaires for measuring socio-emotional constructs relevant to cri. we conclude with design recommendations for research studies aimed at better understanding the effects of cri, before social robots become ubiquitous. this review is relevant to researchers, educators, roboticists, and clinicians interested in designing and using social robots with developmental populations."
KONG2024100328,Examining teachers’ behavioural intention of using generative artificial intelligence tools for teaching and learning based on the extended technology acceptance model,"the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (genai) tools has given rise to a growing discussion of the potential challenges and benefits that the use of these technologies may present in the field of education. this study examines the acceptance of the use of genai tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in hong kong. it uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (tam) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in hong kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. the results show that fostering teachers self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use genai tools. subjective norm was also found to influence teachers behavioural intention. to enhance teachers effective use of genai for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of genai in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. the study has theoretical implications in its extension of the tam model as well as implications for enhancing teachers ai literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of genai tools for teaching and learning in k12 settings."
HENSHAW2018227,9 - Transportation Cyber-Physical System as a Specialised Education Stream,"transportation cyber-physical systems (tcps) is a major area of growth and investment in many countries, but there is a significant shortage of engineers with the correct skills to build safe, secure and efficient tcps. it is suggested that a much broader education is required in cyber-physical system (cps) than has traditionally been the case for degree and masters level students. cps developers will need to be knowledgeable about natural, applied and social sciences. the curriculum for a tcps engineer emerges as a vast range of knowledge requirements and it is suggested that ideally students will graduate with a t-shaped curriculum vitae that provides for a broad knowledge of many subjects and a deep knowledge in one or two. studies into the appropriate curriculum for cps have been conducted since the early 2000s, but it is noted that many of these failed to give adequate weight to ethics and topics in the social sciences. a framework for tcps graduate and postgraduate education is provided: delivery of the curriculum must ensure students are taught in a transdisciplinary manner and develop an holistic approach to tcps development and operation."
MASON2016169,Ubiquitous Citizen Programming,"modern society is increasingly mediated by computers. the quantity and diversity of data generated daily is growing at an astounding rate. while the number of people with programming ability is also growing, the percentage of the population with such capability remains in the single digits. this means that we are witnessing a growing gap between need and capacity. some of the need can be met by packages and apps that provide canned or predefined analysis, but these restrict analyses to those anticipated by the creators of those packages and apps. it is essential that in a data society nearly all citizens have a capacity to program. therefore, it is critical that we find programatic analysis capabilty that is available and accessibly by most citizens."
DENG2025105224,Does ChatGPT enhance student learning? A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies,"chat generative pre-trained transformer (chatgpt) has generated excitement and concern in education. while cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between chatgpt use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. this review examines experimental studies on chatgpts impact on student learning to address this gap. a comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. the findings reveal that chatgpt interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of chatgpt. overall, chatgpt improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. however, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. this review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of chatgpt outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid type ii errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. this review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative ai integration in educational practice."
OZAYDINLIK2024101687,Online Design Thinking Instruction and changes in pre-service teachers’ self-perceptions of Design Thinking and reflective thinking: A mixed-method study,"it is an undeniable fact that design thinking (dt) and reflective thinking (rt) skills are among the qualities that must be possessed by every individual, especially teachers, who are one of the most important pillars in achieving the goals of curriculums, in the world of education where digital technology has become a great power. this makes it necessary to carry out studies to develop teacher training programs in this direction. the purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of dt training on the dt and rt tendencies of pre-service teachers and to elicit the opinions of pre-service teachers on this process. the study group consisted of a total of 44 s-year pre-service teachers, 32 female and 12 male, attending the department of primary teaching in a state university. the study employed an embedded design, one of the mixed methods, and qualitative research was embedded within quantitative research. an quasi-experimental method was used in the quantitative dimension of the study, and the case study design was used in the qualitative dimension. in the experimental dimension the study, data were collected by using the design thinking scale, reflective thinking level determination scale and a personal information form developed by the researcher. the qualitative data of the study were collected by using a semi-structured interview form prepared by the researcher. at the end of the study, it is believed that online dt instruction may have an impact on pre-service teachers both dt and rt tendencies, and that pre-service teachers with low reflection and critical reflection tendencies may have benefited more from online dt instruction compared to those with higher tendencies."

PALOMINO2023100596,Predicting user types with symbolic images: An empirical validation based on two card-sorting studies,"in gamification, personalization is considered an important field of research since it can improve user engagement and motivation. particularly, effective gamified learning needs to strike a balance between gameful design that promotes engagement and does not negatively affect content comprehension and absorption. the existing traditional user-type questionnaires approaches are time-consuming and intrusive, hampering the users focus. previous research in gamification demonstrated how to automate player profile creation through log file analysis of gameful systems instead of traditional approaches, however, psychological archetypes and motivational groups can simplify the process of collecting data to achieve a balanced level of personalization for gamified systems, which are grounded on the users profile and preferences which can help with their immersion. to attend to the needs of a wide range of fields that introduce gamification to systems that are not classified as games, a new ludic approach was created to define user types based on user interaction using symbolic images. in this exploratory research, we tested this approach in two card-sorting studies (n35 and n19). our results show that the images can be used to predict the users archetypes and motivational groups accurately. thus, we contribute with validating an image-based user type classification method that is easier to deploy in systems that do not aim to behave as a game but are looking to reap the benefits of personalizing a users content and gameful experience where relevant. our second contribution is delivering guidelines to replicate this validation method to other existing approaches. we expect that with this guideline, we facilitate personalization with other user typologies without disrupting the gameful experience."
ROBERTSON201350,Robust evaluation for a maturing field: The train the teacher method,"this paper highlights the importance of evaluating educational technology for children in naturalistic classroom contexts. we present the train the teacher method (ttm) which formalizes a method for idc researchers to use when deploying and validating an educational system. our key findings indicate the need to work in partnership with classroom teachers, providing both initial training and continued support. this will both result in more valuable research data, and address a gap in teachers continued professional development. the ttm aims to ensure that teachers, students, and researchers can benefit from innovative educational systems deployed in real classroom contexts. we believe that the ttm could be adapted to other domains of study within interaction design community. the paper goes on to argue the more general point that the interaction design and children community should shift emphasis away from technology innovation and towards reporting replicable longitudinal research findings from real-world settings. we discuss possible approaches to achieving this, for example through changes to reviewing criteria and by actively supporting data and source code sharing."

DEMIR2023101286,Cross-cultural critical thinking profiles: A multigroup latent profile analysis,"background critical thinking (ct) is an important 21st-century skill which enables individuals to actively use their knowledge and problem-solving skills to overcome life challenges. educators, employers, and policymakers focus on ct skills to foster scientific thinking in education. in many countries, the development of ct skills has become a major component in education. ct skills training is offered to students based on the assumption that every student learns these skills in the same manner (i.e., homogeneity assumption). however, if heterogenous groups exist, accounting for this may provide more effective ct skills training. methods latent profile analysis (lpa) was applied to the cornell critical thinking test (cctt) with middle school students from south korea (n 520), turkey (n 996), and the united states (n 1,599), separately, to determine if ct subpopulations exist for each country. generalizability of the latent profiles across countries were investigated through a multi-group lpa similarity assessment. results employing multiple fit criteria, a three-profile solution was identified for each country, and multi-group lpa analysis supported the similarity of the profiles across countries. conclusion similar ct skill profiles across countries suggest that interventions for developing ct skills may be appropriate across educational contexts. further work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind a students ct profile and inform interventions or curricula for fostering ct skills. future directions and limitations were discussed."
LIU2025108569,Enhancing student GAI literacy in digital multimodal composing through development and validation of a scale,"it is widely acknowledged that generative artificial intelligence (gai) has exerted a greater influence on efl learners digital multimodal composing (dmc) process. gai focuses on creating new textual and multimodal content using large language models (llms), and it puts different demands on efl learners. although much research has been conducted on efl learners ai literacy in various socio-cultural contexts, more attention should now be paid to efl learners gai literacy in the dmc context, a new autonomous model of literacy. it should be noted that even though some studies may concentrate on users perceptions and experiences with gai, which may be closely tied to gai literacy, there lacks the development of a scale for assessing gai literacy in dmc. thus, this study attempted to fill these research gaps by developing and validating an applicable and generalizable instrument to measure chinese efl learners multimodal gai literacy in their dmc process. two subsamples (n1 296, n2 294) were randomly invited to respond to the gaidmcs, and the data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (efa) and confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) to test the validity and reliability of the instrument. the findings suggested that a four-factor solution with 17 items can help explain chinese efl learners gai literacy in dmc in terms of affective learning, behavior learning, cognitive learning, and ethical learning. our gai literacy in dmc scale may help improve gai education for researchers and practitioners by providing a comprehensive and plausible framework that can serve as an outline for further syllabus design."
WILSON2024100194,A Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach to understanding students’ perceptions of Automated Writing Evaluation,"automated writing evaluation (awe) has shown promise in enhancing students writing outcomes. however, further research is needed to understand how awe is perceived by middle school students in the united states, as they have received less attention in this field. this study investigated u.s. middle school students perceptions of the mi write awe system. students reported their perceptions of mi writes usefulness using likert-scale items and an open-ended survey question. we used latent dirichlet allocation (lda) to identify latent topics in students comments, followed by qualitative analysis to interpret the themes related to those topics. we then examined whether these themes differed among students who agreed or disagreed that mi write was a useful learning tool. the lda analysis revealed four latent topics: (1) students desire more in-depth feedback, (2) students desire an enhanced user experience, (3) students value mi write as a learning tool but desire greater personalization, and (4) students desire increased fairness in automated scoring. the distribution of these topics varied based on students ratings of mi writes usefulness, with topic 1 more prevalent among students who generally did not find mi write useful and topic 3 more prominent among those who found mi write useful. our findings contribute to the enhancement and implementation of awe systems, guide future awe technology development, and highlight the efficacy of lda in uncovering latent topics and patterns within textual data to explore students perspectives of awe."
SHEN2020886,The New Engineering Education in China,"under the background of accelerating new industrial revolution, chinas higher engineering education is in urgent need of cultivating a group of innovative talents in engineering science and technology. in order to improve the quality of engineering education, china proposed the new engineering research and practice project in june 2017. this study attempted to adopt systematic review based on 207 projects of engineering superior universities in chinas new engineering research and practice project for text analysis, and discovered the common key issues such as mechanism issues, ability issues and discipline issues that are concerned in existing projects. the research findings are as follows: (1) the commonness of construction schemes is emerging. in terms of mechanism construction, the mechanism of collaborative education receives the most attention, while the talent ability pays more attention to the cultivation of soft ability; (2) the overall design of the projects are somewhat lacking innovation and features, and certain construction schemes are similar, failing to effectively combine the advantages of universities and disciplines to serve local industries and truly show its characteristics; (3) most of the construction plans are aimed at the transformation of traditional disciplines, and there is little construction of corresponding disciplines for certain national key industries."
YANG2025101754,Making a Makerspace in early childhood education: Effects on children's STEM thinking skills and emotional development,"makerspaces are used to promote classroom change and creativity for the 21st century. building on the learning theory of constructionism, this intervention study used a curriculum intervention program, making a makerspace (mm), to integrate the makerspace into chinese kindergartens. we used a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the effects of this curriculum intervention, with 120 children enrolled in the experimental classrooms, while the other 111 children enrolled in the waitlist control classrooms. teacher-report child performance (n 231) showed that the mm program resulted in significantly higher scores in childrens stem habits of mind in the intervention group, relative to the control group. analyses of parent-report child behaviors revealed that there was a significant effect of the mm program on post-intervention temperamental surgency. our evidence shows that such a scalable program encourages and guides teachers to build a positive learning environment for supporting young childrens making and thinking in everyday preschool experiences. the makerspace further sets a solid foundation for the development of childrens stem thinking skills and socioemotional skills in a rapidly changing digital society."
MALIK2023122913,Exploring the impact of fairness of social bots on user experience,"there exists literary evidence that there is an established relationship between humanizing bots and customer perceptions of fairness and consequential user experience. this study seeks to evaluate factors that impact the perception surrounding the fairness of social bots and the impact of these factors on user experience. a qualitative approach was used to examine the fairness factors related to social bots and their impact on user experience with the help of data collected from 32 professionals with diverse backgrounds. the results obtained from manual coding and nvivo were assessed to evaluate the convergence of themes for the confluence of results and establish thematic validity. the findings revealed two major themes namely, artificial intelligence (ai) technology governance and ai technology outcome. this research furthers user experience literature and provides a theoretical framework delineating antecedents (ai technology governance and ai technology outcomes) of positive user experience while deploying ai-based social bots."
FOUOTSAMANFOUO2022e11637,Investigating the effects of drought and lockdowns on smallholder and commercial agricultural production in KwaZulu-Natal using remotely sensed data,"not many efforts have been made so far to understand the effects of both the 20152016 drought and the 2020 lockdown measures on the agricultural production of smallholder vis-a-vis commercial farmers in kwazulu-natal. google earth engine, and random forest algorithm, are used to generate a dataset that help to investigate this question. a regression is performed on double differenced data to investigate the effects of interest. a k-mean cluster analysis, is also used to determine whether the distribution patterns of crop production changed with drought and disruption of agricultural production input. results show that: (1) droughts affected the agricultural production of both areas similarly. crop cover declined in both areas for one season after droughts were broken. then recovery was driven by greener, more productive crops rather than the expansion of crop area. (2) the response of both areas to the covid-19 lockdown was also similar. both smallholder and commercial areas normalised difference vegetation index a proxy for crop vitality improved in response to regulations favourable to the sector and improved rainfall. no significant adjustments in crop cover were observed. production therefore changed primarily at the intensive margin (improved productivity of existing croplands) rather than the extensive (changing the extent of land under cultivation). (3) cluster analysis allows for a more granular view, showing that the positive impact of lockdowns on agriculture were concentrated in areas with high rainfall and close proximity to metropolitan markets. both smallholder and commercial farmers therefore are reliant on market access together with favourable environmental conditions for improved production."
CHU20181,Supporting scientific modeling through curriculum-based making in elementary school science classes,"our work investigates how making may be used in the context of scientific modeling in formal elementary school science classes. this paper presents an investigation of fourth- and fifth-grade students engaging in making activities to create simulation, concept-process, and illustrative models in the science classroom. based on video analyses of the making-based class sessions, a generalized process model was developed for each type of science model. in addition, cross-cutting themes were found in making-based science modeling: first, there are two loops that intersect and interact with each other (modeling for making and modeling for science content), and they interrelate in various ways depending on science model type; and second, showcasing making products (sharing with peers, teachers, or helpers) is a primary factor that determines students overall engagement with science in the activity. we suggest that making-based science kit and lesson design needs to support students to showcase their making output, on top of science-related reflections, and to consider the balance between making and science activity. we conclude that making has the potential to support the development of scientific model thinking in the elementary science classroom, but much further research is needed in this area."
DEJONG2023100536,Let's talk evidence – The case for combining inquiry-based and direct instruction,"many studies investigating inquiry learning in science domains have appeared over the years. throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. in this vein, zhang, kirschner, cobern, and sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. in the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. we review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. we show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. we subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students prior knowledge and other student characteristics. furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. we conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures."
KORDAKI2013141,High school computing teachers' beliefs and practices: A case study,"the aim of this work is threefold. firstly, an empirical study was designed with the aim of investigating the beliefs that high school computing (hsc) teachers hold about: (a) their motivational orientation, self-efficacy, and self-expectations as computing teachers, (b) the nature of hsc and its curricula, (c) how their students could be better learners in computing, and the expectations they have of their students, and (d) their own teaching approaches and the alternatives they propose for best teaching of hsc. secondly, an empirical study was realized to investigate the same hsc teachers classroom practices. thirdly, possible associations between the teachers beliefs and their teaching practices were investigated. 25 hsc teachers participated, their beliefs being elicited through structured interviews, while their practices were investigated through non-participant observation, using structured observation sheets. the analysis of the data revealed that hsc teachers as a group held various beliefs about the aforementioned issues: some of these beliefs can empower teachers to realize constructivist approaches while others can constrain them to the well-known traditional behaviorist practices. the majority of hsc teachers expressed mixed beliefs (empowering and constraining) and reported feeling overwhelmed, with little control over their teaching, due to contextual barriers, the rapid evolution of computing and, subsequently, their lack of knowledge about current trends and didactics in this discipline, as well as the perceived students culture about computing as playing games and surfing the internet. data analysis also shows that there are synergies between hsc teachers beliefs and practices. in the case of mixed beliefs, at least one constraining belief is reflected in teachers real practices. however, the descriptions of practices given by most of those teachers during the interviews are not fully reflected in their practices."
PERISIC2023e16836,"The foundation for future education, teaching, training, learning, and performing infrastructure - The open interoperability conceptual framework approach","the proliferation of information and communication technologies (ict) in education, teaching, training, learning, and the operational application (performing) of acquired knowledge, skills, and competencies in contemporary social environments has directly influenced the transformation of early networked learning (nl) concepts into a global learning infrastructure. creating cooperativecollaborative stakeholders networks composed of learning subjects, objects, and competencies consumers, exposes the significant potential for gaining overall social progress. the main challenging obstacles of such globalization are: embedding semantics into the competence credentials carriers, trusted dissemination of verifiable competence tokens, the heterogeneous ontologies mapping, and sustainable service delivery infrastructure. the mainstream motivation of our research is the specification and development of a conceptual framework that fosters the interoperability of different stakeholders, whether individual or institutional, to declare, share and maintain the representative collections of information resources related to the particular education, learning, teaching, training, and performing (research, development, production, and service) endeavors. in this article, we have specified an open, heterogeneous, interoperable conceptual framework capable of orchestrating past, current, and future paradigms to foster building the foundations for comparative analysis and evaluation of traditional and nontraditional competency-building processes, joined with students portfolio creation, dissemination, and management. it is a starting specification that would serve for the future: open, heterogeneous, cooperativecollaborative, service-oriented software framework specification and development."
SHANSHAN2022104630,Metaphor and board writing matter: The mediating roles of psychological distance and immersion in video lectures,"the present study investigated the inuence of metaphor and board writing on students learning performance, continuance intention, and recommendation intention through the mediating effects of psychological distance and immersion. four aspects of psychological distancetemporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical distanceand immersion are introduced to identify the mechanism. through a two (with versus without metaphor) by two (with versus without board writing) between-subject experimental design, 193 participants were randomly assigned to one of four sets of video lectures on the gradient descent method, followed by an online questionnaire. partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the research model. the results demonstrate that metaphor has a significant effect on all four aspects of psychological distance and immersion, while board writing has an impact only on hypothetical distance. social distance mediates the relationship between metaphor and learning performance, recommendation intention, and continuance intention; hypothetical distance mediates the interplay between metaphor, board writing, and learning performance; and immersion mediates the link between metaphor and recommendation intention."
TSOUTSA2024180,Empowering urban futures: Key competencies for smart city resilience officers,"as cities are developing to smart, new systems are utilized that contain a multitude of critical infrastructures. although these offer major advantages, they are also exposed to new external and frequently uncontrollable factors increasing their risk exposure and enhancing their vulnerability. therefore, increasing resilience during city development has become a prerequisite for its survival, but continuous resilience improvement led by workforce will help them to prosper. according to researchers, officers should be able to catalogue and prioritize threats and vulnerabilities, but is this only the case discrete studies detail and analyze in-depth risks related to smart cities, however, how these risks are addressed by workforce and how these are related to their competencies have not been thoroughly understood to date. if vulnerabilities are not understood and analyzed appropriately by the city workforce and stakeholders, unanticipated consequences and cascading failures may potential occur, even when crises are expected. the objective of this article is to inquire into responsibilities regarding crisis issues concerning the necessary competencies for resilience officers, by exploring current perceptions, expectations and recommendations as these are acknowledged in experts opinions and experiences. to do so, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to experts in the field, across various cities in greece, to indicate responsibilities, and prioritize competencies that resilient officers in smart cities should possess. the findings highlighted significant responsibilities related to managing smart city risks and identified a distinct set of competencies unique to officers in this area, emphasizing the need for targeted efforts to enhance urban resilience through the initiatives led by city officers. this article establishes a clear path for advancing smart city research by highlighting competencies that could be integrated into educational curriculums. these competencies are essential for training a workforce that not only enhances disaster management awareness but also equips cities to handle potential catastrophic events effectively, thereby laying the groundwork for more resilient urban environments."
AURAVA2023100129,"Future-oriented skills and knowledge in game jams, a systematic literature review","game jams, events for co-creating digital or non-digital games, are connected to learning in several ways: learning is a common motivation for participation and various learning results have been reported as their outcome. the existing literature on game jam learning consists mostly of descriptive individual case studies, with very incohesive and varied research aims, methods, and settings. thus far, there have been no attempts to further analyze and classify the reported results of the previous studies. this article looks at existing research on game jams and learning, comparing the reported learning results to the future-oriented skills and knowledge. the data set, created utilizing the prisma checklist, consists of 25 original articles published between 2010 and 2022. the results show that participation in a game jam event will likely increase interdisciplinary, epistemic, and procedural knowledge. furthermore, it can increase disciplinary knowledge depending on the theme and other framings of the event. participation in a game jam event will likely further cognitive and metacognitive skills as well as social and emotional skills, provided the jam event is organized to create a safe and inclusive space for learning. participation in a game jam will also likely further diverse practical and physical skills, but the adoption of these skills varies depending on individuals tasks inside their team. ict-related skills are furthered in jam events concentrating on digital games and can be supported when making non-digital games. thus, game jams offer a well-suited method for learning future-oriented skills and knowledge."
UNTERNAHRER20241115,Enhancing Knowledge Transmission: The Perspective of Gamification User Profiles,"in the realm of knowledge transmission, organizations face the challenge of finding effective strategies to engage individuals and facilitate knowledge transfer. traditional methods often fall short, failing to capture individuals attention and ignite their motivation to actively participate in the knowledge transmission process. this article introduces colearnis, a novel knowledge transmission platform, which allows peers to transfer knowledge in a gamified manner by using videos and quizzes which are directly created by the employees. this article also presents a long-term field study investigating the use of colearnis with 130 employees in a worldwide metallurgy and tooling company. a multi-dimensional evaluation approach makes use of user surveys and behavior-tracking data to explore prospective avenues which might benefit knowledge transmission. users have been profiled under demographical and managerial aspects, however also under their gamification user types according to the hexad framework for gamification design. this study explores the connections between user profiles and engagement behaviors within colearnis. the findings suggest that factors such as; age influence the achiever and philanthropist user types, however also that individuals with greater managerial duties are more likely to be classified as socializer, free-spirit, or philanthropist user types. additionally, this study suggests that socializer or disruptor user types are more likely to consume or react to peers self-created knowledge. on the other hand, achiever user profiles are less likely to react or start quizzes. these findings equip organizations with valuable insights to further design and implement engaging ad-hoc knowledge transmission systems. these systems could be further tailored to align with individuals managerial profiles and gamification user types, optimizing engagement and increasing the likelihood of successful knowledge transmission."
PRINSLOO2018263,Synthesis of an intelligent rural village microgrid control strategy based on smartgrid multi-agent modelling and transactive energy management principles,"humanitarian and other development organisations are calling for replicable self-sustaining solutions to shared micro-utilities to ensure equitable modern energy delivery to energy-deprived village communities. distributed smart microgrid technology allows for the efficient integration of sustainable resources to provide localised energy delivery at improved levels of reliability and resilience. smart energy management in decentralised renewable systems requires computational intelligence to implement pivotal energy-awarecost-aware procedures in decision-making for a conceptualised next generation smart village microgrid platform. smart village microgrid control automation aims at offering pragmatic and, intelligent control capabilities to perform price-based demand response energy management. this paper proposes the use of cascaded control abstraction in the implementation of a price-sensitive cyber-physical smart grid approach in a rural off-grid microgrid environment. the modular microgrid design integrates renewable energy resources through an adaptive control algorithm developed in a model-based design approach. the solution is based on distributed market-based control, using multi-agent transactive principles to navigate automated demand response. multi-priority load clusters with the selective parallel control of non-intelligent device groups allow for prioritised supplydemand resource coordination. the proposed smart village solution operates as a self-regulating smart microgrid energy management system and by virtue of its market-based transactive reasoning approach is able to meet multiple operating requirements of rural village energy systems. simulation results for this value-based control technique highlight the value of customer engagement combined with supply-, demand- and economic cost optimisation for hybrid renewable distributed energy microgrids."

FANG2024293,Quantifying structural distortion manipulation for desired perovskite phase: Part I. Paradigm demonstration in tungsten oxides,"slight distortions can cause dramatic changes in the properties of crystalline perovskite materials and their derivatives. due to the numerous types of distortions and unclarified distortion-structure relations, a quantitative distortion manipulation for the desired crystalline phase of perovskite materials suitable for various application remains challenging. here, by establishing parameter sets to systematically describe the types, magnitudes and positional relations involved in distortions, we are able to interpret the structural regulations and manipulation strategies in 7 reported crystal systems. through the construction of distortion-phase-property functional curves, we further propose a paradigm to quantify the structural distortion manipulation for desired perovskite phases. using the example of perovskite-like tungsten oxides, we successfully quantify their volume shrinkage and symmetry increase during lithiation. this work verifies that the complicated research and development of perovskite materials can be simplified into a mathematical problem solving process, which will inspire researchers with different backgrounds to participate, especially mathematicians and computer scientists."
LAPORTE201848,"A comparative analysis of programming games, looking through the lens of an instructional design model and a game attributes taxonomy","the emerging trend of teaching computer programming to more and younger people has led to the development of game-based learning and teaching approaches. in this context, educational games are considered as a promising learning platform. however, research in the field of programming games has mainly focused on what is being taught in these games. less is known, however, about how programming games afford learning and playing by design. to address this, we performed a qualitative, comparative analysis of 19 programming games from an instructional and game attributes perspective. the findings showed that a majority of programming games presents only a moderate alignment with established instructional principles. furthermore, significant differences in the presence and prevalence of their game attributes were found. our analysis resulted in a systematic classification of programming games according to their alignment with instructional principles and their positioning on a playing-versus-programming spectrum. informed by this twofold classification, we explored whether particular programming games can still be conceptualized as games, as opposed to learning or programming environments. accordingly, we formulated opportunities and restrictions towards their potential context-of-use."

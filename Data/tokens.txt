posed
a
challenge
often
involving
the
introduction
of

concepts
this
study
aimed
to
bridge
this
gap
by
introducing
an
augmented

are
the
foundation
of

assessment
is
an
important
part
of
testing
the
effectiveness
of

however
the
existing
computational

still
suffer
from
the
problem
of
insufficient

leading
to
the
lack

2020
and
it
is
necessary
to
foster
programming
thinking
effectively
various
learning
tools
have
been
developed
to
introduce
programming
concepts
and
many
studies
have
been
conducted
to
develop
tools
using
music
to
foster
computational
thinking
that
includes
programming
thinking
in
this
study
we
focused
on
the
affinity
between
the
basic
movements
of
the
railway
toy
and
the
melodies
and
chord
progressions
and
we
developed
a
learning
tool
to
foster
computational
thinking
by
combining
music
and
the
railway
toy
in
this
study
an
activity
using
this
tool
was
developed
and
subjects
were
asked
to
experience
the
activity
based
on
the
subjects
progress
in
the
activity
and
their
opinions
in
the
questionnaire
the
improvement
of
the
activity
is
discussed
this
work-in-progress
research-to-practice
paper
presents
an
intervention
on
integrating
computational
thinking
modules
into
a
software
engineering
course
the
national
consensus
on
the
significance
of
computational
thinking
has
prompted
the
expansion
of
related
educational
initiatives
over
the
past
decade
since
the
definition
of
computational
thinking
by
wing
in
2006
this
concept
has
gained
significant
attention
within
the
educational
community
particularly
this
surge
of
interest
has
led
to
extensive
research
into
its
conceptual
foundations
and
subsequent
integration
into
educational
curricula
since
2013
national
initiatives
have
since
emerged
to
incorporate
computational
thinking
into
the
educational
system
furthermore
as
artificial
intelligence
and
computing
systems
become
increasingly
integrated
into
daily
life
there
is
a
growing
demand
from
industries
for
a
workforce
and
graduates
adept
at
critical_thinking
and
problem-solving
aligned
with
this
national
movement
our
study
presents
a
two-year
institutional
initiative
aimed
at
integrating
computational
thinking
into
the
software
engineering
program
the
software
engineering
discipline
extensively
involves
design
thinking
and
problem-solving
skills
however
we
noticed
that
these
higher-level
skills
are
not
imparted
early
in
the
program
to
teach
students
this
method
of
thinking
and
approaching
problems
to
bridge
this
skill
gap
we
developed
a
set
of
computational
thinking
modules
and
integrated
them
into
a
gateway
course
in
the
software
engineering
program
over
two
years
we
implemented
this
intervention
in
an
introductory-level
course
and
evaluated
its
impact
on
students
computational
thinking
skills
by
analyzing
their
responses
to
a
standard
computational
thinking
assessment
survey
the
results
showed
significant
improvement
in
most
components
these
early
findings
underscore
the
effectiveness
of
integrating
these
computational
thinking
modules
into
the
gateway
courses
regardless
of
the
specific
course
topic
a
notable
feature
of
these
modules
is
their
adaptability
to
diverse
engineering
courses
suggesting
broader
applicability
across
disciplines
moving
forward
our
research
aims
to
expand
the
integration
of
the
computational
thinking
modules
into
various
courses
in
other
institutes
across
the
nation
and
analyze
their
impact
on
student
performance
this
study
attempted
to
investigate
elementary_school
teachers
understandings
beliefs
and
intentions
toward
stem
and
computational
thinking
we
collected
data
through
a
survey
of
16
teachers
at
one
elementary_school
in
malang
city
indonesia
they
represented
a
variety
of
subjects
with
diverse
learning
experiences
the
survey
took
place
after
the
respondents
received
a
short
training
about
stem
and
computational
thinking
quantitative
analysis
showed
that
most
elementary_school
teachers
positively
demonstrated
computational
thinking
practices
in
their
schools
besides
they
believed
that
computational
thinking
could
help
students
think
logically
structurally
and
creatively
while
stem
helped
train
students
to
be
problem
solvers
in
an
analytical
critical
and
practical
way
in
addition
most
respondents
intended
to
continue
learning
and
applying
stem
and
computational
thinking
approaches
in
their
learning
design
added
to
this
the
participants
understanding
of
stem
and
computational
thinking
also
improved
based
on
the
results
of
the
wilcoxon
test
conducted
on
the
pre-test
and
post-test
this
study
provides
valuable
information
on
the
need
for
elementary

development
programs
namely
improving
teachers
teaching
skills
based
on
stem
and
computational

physiological
computing
pc
technology
is
becoming
increasingly
popular
as
wearable
hardware
improves
however
little
is
known
regarding
potential
connections
between
hands-on
experience
with
physiological
computing
technology
and
computation
thinking
perspectives
this
is
particularly
true
for
black
communities
applications
for
physiological
computing
include
systems
such
as
wearable

eg
apple

capable
of
mapping
students
physiological

to
various
outputs
the
work
discussed
in
this
paper
presents
our
initial
steps
toward
filling
these
gaps
in
particular
we
share
our
observations
of
computational

perspectives
that
emerged
while
black
high_school
students
constructed
simple
programs
driven
by
near
real-time

information
our
findings
suggest
interactive
physiological

may
lead
to
unique
computational

the
results

learning
activities
can
develop

because
of
these
activities
were
challenged
students
with
real

problems
that
required

to
solve
the
problems
by
decompose

abstraction
thinking
and
develop
algorithm
for

so
these
stem

activities
could
be
effectively
used
in
computing
course
a
significant
aspect
of
computational
thinking
is
as
a
way
of
reasoning
about
the
world
in
terms
of

this
mindset
channels
number-crunching
toward
an
ambition
to
discover

here
we
show
how
computational

critically
revealed
no

our
findings
provide
evidence
of
a
crippled
computational

mindset
in
students
who
acquire
mathematical
skills
that
are
not
channelled
toward
real-world

ends
up
being
perceived
as

the
virtuous

indicates
that
computational

can
be
restored
by
training
students
specifically
in
coding

our
approach

the
ability
to
have
computational

is
an
essential
skill
facilitating
computational

cannot
only
help
students
understand
the
professional
knowledge
and
principles
of
computer
but
also
bring
new
ideas
to
addressing
complex
problems
therefore
many
colleges
and
universities
have
carried
out
computer
professional
curriculum
reform
based
on
computational
thinking
due
to
the
high
degree
of
abstraction
of
computational

traditional
teaching
methods
will
cause
students
to
understand
computational

only
at
the
conceptual
level
and
cannot
realize
the
flexible
use
of

course
as
an
example
to
explain
how
to
integrate
the

face
the
pressure
of
study
and
work
and
there
is
a
need
to
improve
their
computational

skills
in
this
paper
we
design
and
develop
a
set
of
programming
activities
based
on
computational

development
for
adult
college
students
and
study
the
changes
in
students
computational

before
and
after
they
participate
in
the
activities
it
provides
a
reference
for
frontline
teachers
and
related
researchers
to
design
programming
activities
and
conduct
research
in
computational
thinking
as
the
information
age
has
progressed
computational
thinking
ability
to
solve
problems
has
become
an
indispensable
way
of
life
in

many
scholars
believe
that
the
process
of
solving
problems
will
be
more
logical
if
they
have
computational
thinking
ability
at
the
same
time
scholars
believe
that
a
good
learning
method
improves
learners
intrinsic
motivation
therefore
in
this
research
we
try
to
use
conceptual
mapping
so
that
students
can
construct
knowledge
when
composing
their
own
images
as
the
focus
of
this
learning
model
and
computational
thinking
is
the
thinking
process
and
the
two
coincide
this
research
intends
to
introduce
the
traditional
programming
robot
course
into
conceptual
mapping
and
measure
whether
there
are
differences
in
computational

tendencies
problem-solving
tendencies
and
intrinsic
motivations
between
students
who
use
conceptual
mapping
and
those
who
do
not
use
it
the

is
advocated
as
a
skill
that
everyone
should
possess
and
stem
content
and
background
can
be
conducive
to
the
learning
of

this
study
constructed
a
theoretical
model
of
the
impact
of
stem

and
measured
the
mediating
effects
of

the
study
included
a
questionnaire
of
1870
secondary_school
students
and
a
descriptive
correlational
and
mediating
analysis
the
results
show
that
stem
courses
can
predict
students’
computational
thinking
through
students’
problem_solving
ability
and
students’
attitude
towards
stem
the
results
of
this

shows
growing
importance
in
methodical
approaches
used
in
the
classroom
although
many
examples
exist
for
using
critical
and
computational
thinking
in
stem
educational
area
the
social
sciences
ie
non-stem
areas
were
somehow
left
out
due
to
the
relatively
more
difficult
design
of
such
content
especially
in
the
part
of
the
development
of
computational
thinking
in
that
context
in
this
paper
we
present
one
way
of
using
critical
and
computational
thinking
in
non-stem
education
more
specifically
on
the
example
of
historical
data
sources
through
the
use
of
programming
in
python
as
an
example
we
use
historical
data
for
trans-atlantic
slave
trade
routes
that
were
the
largest
long-distance
coerced
movement
of
people
in
history
up
to
the
mid-nineteenth

for
connecting
concepts
of

data
science
and
programming
for
development
of
critical

science
this
way
of
using
modern
approaches
in
classroom
should
give
teachers
and
pupils
a
broader
picture
of
importance
of
interdisciplinary
education
for
critical

worldwide
have
supported
educational
initiatives
primarily
at
the
k-12
level
however
curricular
changes
are
not
enough
teachers
need
to
be
prepared
so
they
develop
the

the
primary
objective
of
this
research
was
to
investigate
effective
learning
sequences
starting
with
computational
thinking
programming
or
both
we
experimented
with
and
analyzed
the
learning
sequence
of
students
from
the
department
of
computer
engineering
information
management
and
mechanical
engineering
the
findings
indicated
that
the
students
of
the
department
of
computer
engineering
possessed
prior
experiences
in
programming
or
computational
thinking
their
learning
sequences
limitedly
impacted
learning
outcomes
conversely
for
the
students
of
the
department
of
information
management
learning
computational
thinking
before
programming
did
not
result
in
better
learning
outcomes
emphasizing
the
need
for
coherence
in
courses
the
students
of
the
department
of
mechanical
engineering
showed
the
practical
value
of
computational
thinking
in
non-it
disciplines
particularly
in
using
specialized
software
such
as
matlab
for
students
with
foundational
knowledge
the
learning
sequence
between
learning
computational
thinking
and
programming
was
less
significant
however
for
beginners
or
those
from
non-it
backgrounds
effective
learning
required
the
coherence
and
integration
of
courses
thus
it
is
required
to
maintain
cross-course
coherence
and
establish
links
between
computational
thinking
and
programming
skills
to
offer
a
more
in-depth
learning
experience
many
undergraduate
students
in
software
engineering
have
trouble
developing
computational
thinking
several
tools
have
been
reported
in
the
literature
to
support
the
development
of
computational
thinking
this
paper
reports
a
systematic
literature
review
to
present
the
characteristics
that
have
made
successful
web
systems
that
support
the
development
of
computational
thinking
in
recent
years
and
the
reported
limitations
eighteen
primary
studies
were
selected
where
the
strategies
used
are
usually
learning
through
lessons
practicing
with
exercises
working
through
games
and
using
feedback
the
systems
found
have
been
used
at
different
elementary
middle
high_school
and
bachelors
degree
levels
finally
the
main
limitations
reported
in
using
these
systems
were
mainly
the
difficulty
of
the
topics
the
previous
knowledge
that
the
students
should
have
the
attitude
that
the
students
showed
and
the
lack
of
motivation
finally
we
make
some
recommendations
to
software
engineering
curriculum
planners
and
programming
teachers
about
systems
for
developing
computational
thinking
the
employment
of
technology
as
a
tool
is
a
reality
in
any
area
of
knowledge
technology
is
present
and
permanently
impacts
our
society
including
its
effects
on
education
computational
thinking
is
a
way
of
critically
and
creatively
using
the
fundamentals
of
computer
science
to
solve
problems
making
it
essential
for
success
in
the
job
market
this
article
aims
to
stimulate
computational
thinking
in
children
from
the
first
years
of
elementary_school
ranging
from
the
1
st
to
the
5
th
grades
which
corresponds
to
the
age
group
from
6
to
10
years
old
for
developing
computational
thinking
in
the
students
a
didactic
sequence
was
created
using
several
tools
namely
naval
battle
blockly_games
and
the
scratch
block_programming
language
the
sequence
of
artifacts
created
with
scratch
simulates
a
robot
with
color
sensors
and
as
students
progress
in
learning
new
challenges
are
added
with
the
use
of
sensors
sounds
and
animations
this
project
aims
to
show
the
importance
of
computational
thinking
and
encourage
teachers
to
make
it
increasingly
present
in
the
classroom
computational
thinking
is
a
type
of
analytical
thinking
that
is
developed
intentionally
that
is
under
a
“learned”
approach
and
the
best
way
to
learn
it
is
through
computer
programming
in
this
paper
the
experience
of
using
block-based
programming
environments
such
as
scratch
lightbot
and
the
pselnt
pseudo-code
tool
for
the
understanding
of
computational_concepts
and
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
is
reported
a
quasi-experimental
methodological
design
was
used
since
it
did
not
work
with
a
control
group
a
mixed
exploratory
investigation
was
carried
out
85
first-year
students
from
the
accounting
professional
school
of
the
national
university
of
san
agustin
de
arequipa
participated
in
the
experience
the
results
show
that
in
introductory
programming
courses
of
short
time
period
teaching
with
block-based
programming
environments
compared
to
the
use
of
pseudocode
with
the
pselnt
tool
facilitates
the
appropriation
of
computational_concepts
and
the
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
thus
obtaining
better
learning
results
it
is
concluded
that
block-based
programming
environments
favor
the
construction
of
knowledge
and
foster
the
development
of
creativity
and
algorithmic_thinking
as
the
process
of

progresses
it
is
recognized
that
computational
thinking
is
one
of
the

this
research-to-practice
full
paper
describes
the
readiness
of
pre-service
mathematics
teachers
to
incorporate
scratch
a
block-based
programming
application
into
mathematics
instruction
focusing
on
their
knowledge
skills
and
attitudes
given
the
rapid
technological
advancements
leveraging
technology
in
mathematics
education
is
crucial
in
fostering
proficient
problem-solving
abilities
among
students
consequently
computational
thinking
is
recognized
as
a
vital
21st-century
competency
a
transferable
skill
for
effective
problem-solving
methods
the
study
underscores
the
importance
of
integrating
scratch
a
supportive
tool
in
computational
thinking
into
mathematics
education
however
to
integrate
this
application
into
mathematics
education
pre-service
teachers
must
be
prepared
to
acquire
the
necessary
knowledge
and
skills
and
to
be
ready
to
accept
its
use
in
teaching
in
the
future
the
construction
of
knowledge
by
pre-service
mathematics
teachers
regarding
the
scratch
application
is
examined
through
the
lens
of
social
constructivism
which
emphasizes
knowledge
construction
through
experience
and
social
interaction
a
purposive
sample
of
60
first-
and
second-year
students
participated
in
an
online
survey
the
sample
selection
involving
two
groups
aimed
to
identify
significant
differences
in
pre-service
teachers
readiness
levels
across
gender
study
year
and
academic
achievement
the
findings
revealed
limited
proficiency
among
pre-service
mathematics
teachers
in
utilizing
scratch
particularly
regarding
its
integration
into
mathematics
instruction
several
factors
contribute
to
the
deficiency
in
skills
among
pre-service
mathematics
teachers
in
navigating
the
scratch
application
including
requiring
additional
time
to
grasp
the
programming
language
employed
in
the
application
challenges
in
arranging
blocks
to
achieve
desired
outputs
and
struggles
in
rectifying
syntax
errors
however
there
was
a
positive
attitude
towards
the
application
indicating
a
strong
inclination
to
enhance
their
skills
the
study
also
found
no
significant
differences
in
demographic
variables
such
as
gender
study
year
or
academic
achievement
but
a
slight
correlation
exists
between
knowledge
attitudes
and
academic
achievement
investigating
pre-service
teachers
readiness
to
integrate
scratch
into
mathematics
instruction
sheds
light
into
the
intersection
between
mathematics
pedagogy
and
computational
thinking
this
intersection
underscores
the
importance
of
integrating
programming
tools
like
scratch
into
mathematics
education
to
cultivate
computational
thinking
skills
additionally
the
findings
contribute
to
the
broader
discourse
on
the
role
of
technology
in
education
and
highlight
the
need
for
enhanced
training
and
support
for
pre-service
teachers
in
leveraging
technology
effectively
for
instructional
purposes
with
the
development
of
computer
technology
the
current
concept
of
“computational
thinking”
has
been
generally
recognized
by
everyone
“computational
thinking”
provides
strong
support
for
the
development
and
research
of
various
disciplines
the
reform
of
university
computer
basic
courses
guided
by
“computational
thinking”
has
become
an
important
direction
for
the
current
reform
of
computer
public
basic
courses
in
recent
years
our
school’s
series
of
reform
measures
based
on
the
public
basic
courses
of
computer
have
achieved
obvious
results
which
proves
that
this
orientation
is
worthy
of
promotion
computational
thinking
has
become
an
essential
skill
nowadays
many
educational
institutions
around
the
world
have
adopted
computational
thinking
as
an
elementary
or
complementary
subject
in
their
teaching
schedules
one
of
the
approaches
that
is
efficient
in
teaching
and
learning
computational
thinking
has
been
visual
programming
however
like
other
applications
used
daily
visual
programming
tools
can
be
a
limiting
factor
for
the
blind
in
learning
computational
thinking
this
work
aims
to
present
the
ivprog4all
an
accessible
visual
programming
system
based
on
forms
a
preliminary
study
was
carried
out
to
test
the
usability
of
ivprog4all
and
accessibility
with
a
blind
user
the
results
show
that
although
some
usability
issues
need
to
be
fixed
the
system
proved
accessible
for
blind
people
many
block-based
programming
environments
have
proven
to
be
effective
at
engaging
novices
in
learning
programming
however
most
restrict
access
to
the
outside
world
limiting
learners
to
commands
and
computing
resources
built
in
to
the
environment
some
allow
learners
to
drag
and
drop
files
connect
to
sensors
and
robots
locally
or
issue
http
requests
but
in
a
world
where
most
of
the
applications
in
our
daily
lives
are
distributed
ie
their
functionality
depends
on
communicating
with
other
programs
or
accessing
resources
and
data
on
the
internet
the
lack
of
support
for
beginners
to
envision
and
create
such
distributed
programs
is
a
lost
opportunity
this
paper
argues
that
it
is
not
only
feasible
but
crucial
to
create
environments
with
simple
yet
powerful
abstractions
that
open
up
distributed
computing
and
other
widely
used
but
advanced
computing
concepts
including
networking
the
internet
of
things
and
cybersecurity
to
novices
by
thus
removing
the
walls
around
our
environments
we
can
expand
opportunities
for
learning
considerably
programs
can
access
a
wealth
of
online
data
and
web
services
and
communicate
with
other
projects
moreover
these
changes
can
enable
young
learners
to
collaborate
with
each
other
during
program
construction
whether
they
share
their
physical
location
or
study
remotely
importantly
providing
access
to
the
wider
world
will
also
help
counter
widespread
student
perceptions
that
block-based
environments
are
mere
toys
and
show
that
they
are
capable
of
creating
compelling
applications
the
paper
presents
netsblox
a
programming
environment
that
supports
these
ideas
and
shows
that
tools
can
be
designed
to
democratize
access
to
powerful
ideas
in
computing
in
recent
years
large
language
models
llms
have
been
employed
significantly
in
different
domains
of
computing
education
nevertheless
these
models
have
been
focused
on
essential
adherence
to
their
integration
as
coding
assistants
in
computing
education
however
attention
has
been
switched
to
thoroughly
examining
and
analyzing
llm
behavior
particularly
in
computing
education
for
programming
tasks
such
as
code
generation
code
explanation
and
programming
error
message
explanation
therefore
it
becomes
imperative
to
understand
their
behavior
to
examine
potential
pitfalls
this
article
addresses
this
gap
systematically
and
details
how
different
llm-based
coding
chatbots
such
as
chatgpt
codex
copilot
and
others
react
to
various
coding
inputs
within
computing
education
to
achieve
this
objective
we
collected
and
analyzed
articles
from
2021
to
2024
and
72
studies
were
thoroughly
examined
these
objectives
include
investigating
the
existing
limitations
and
challenges
associated
with
utilizing
these
systems
for
coding
tasks
assessing
their
responses
to
prompts
containing
coding
syntax
examining
the
impact
of
their
output
on
student
learning
and
evaluating
their
performance
as
debugging
tools
the
findings
of
this
review
highlight
that
it
is
premature
to
incorporate
these
systems
into
computing
education
due
to
their
limitations
that
may
limit
their
effectiveness
as
comprehensive
coding
assistants
for
computer
science
students
these
limitations
include
issues
with
handling
prompts
containing
code

potential
negative
impacts
on

of
an
introductory

science
for
postdoctoral
researchers
pdrs
in
the

the
use
of
computing
software
has
become
ubiquitous
and
a
working
knowledge
of

science
has
become
increasingly
essential
for
researchers
in

however
curriculum
development
focusing
on
imparting
foundational
programming
skills
and
fundamentals
of
data
science
for
researchers
in
domains
other
than
computing
has
been
scarce
thus
there
is
an
unmet
need
for
curriculum
development
involving
computational
thinking
programming
and
the
fundamentals
of
data
science
for
this
audience
recognizing
these
growing
needs
and
demands
of
researchers
to
learn
programming
and
data
science
that
can
then
be
applied
to
their
area
of
research
or
practice
we
developed
an
introductory
course
in
programming
and
data
science
for
pdrs
in
biology
and
medicine
the
primary
goal
of
the
course
was
to
develop
computational
thinking
skills
in
pdrs
who
hail
from
backgrounds
that
have
traditionally
not
focused
on
inculcating
computational
thinking
this
course
covered
the
fundamental
concepts
of
programming
using
either
python
or
r
-
languages
that
researchers
outside
the
computing
community
use
in
numerous
ways
including
the
statistical
analysis
of
large
datasets
that
are
becoming
increasingly
common
in
biomedical
research
further
pdrs
enrolled
in
the
course
were
introduced
to
some
of
the
broad
categories
of
problems
in
data
science
-
exploratory
data
analysis
classification
regression
and
clustering
-
along
with
relevant
algorithms
and
how
they
can
be
applied
to
real-world
datasets
in
their
respective
domains
using
packages
or
libraries
in
python
or
r
we
also
report
the
feedback
from
the
enrolled
pdrs
lessons
learned
and
recommendations
for
instructors
interested
in
designing
similar
curricula
our
course
focusing
on
computing
and
data
science
education
for
postdoctoral
scholars
from
a
non-computing
background
demonstrates
a
promising
model
for
incorporating
computing
education
in
other
areas
of
study
that
do
not
traditionally
have
a
focus
on
computing
education
as
well
as
in
continuing
education
in
a
world
in
a
continuous

the
rapid

has
recently
led
to
their
introduction
into
the

of
the

a
discipline
that
involves
both
the
formation
of

and
the
formation
of
computational

necessary
for
the
efficient
and

in
this

we
presented
a
method
of
approaching
in
the
school
educational

the
study
of
wireless

through
an

the

consisted
of
creating
a

via
a

with
the
capacity
to
collect

at
massive
scales
are
examples
of
tools
that
have
broadened
priorities
in
computing
to
include
data
science
in
response
there
has
been
growing
attention
in
research
and
practice
emphasizing
pre-college
groups
this
is
partly
because
of
the
growing
recognition-reflected
in
initiatives
like
cs4all
codeorg
bootstrap
data
science
exploring
computer
science-that
learning
experiences
before
college
are
consequential
in
sustaining
a
robust
pipeline
of
computer
scientists
and
engineers
despite
these
inroads
there
is
justifiable
concern
that
existing
efforts
might
not
fully
support
learner
development
in
the
necessary
conceptual
epistemological
and
heuristic
styles
needed
to
productively
parse
and
understand
“big
data”
this
is
because
computing-based
curricula
that
include
data
science
often
involve
data
curated
by
others
rather
than
learners
directly
which
results
in
simulated
versions
of
practice
instead
of
engagement
that
is
realistically
discursive
and
messy
this
is
further
complicated
by
the
persistent
shortage
of
k-12
computer
science
teachers
in
general
and
even
fewer
who
can
design
and
implement
curricula
that
support
authentic
engagement
with
data
science
to
address
these
issues
we
leverage
culturally
relevant
and
constructionist
perspectives
in
a
sandbox
ie
open-ended
science
where
tools
like
scratch
and
electronic
textiles
e-textiles
have
had
success
expanding
possibilities
in
computing
to
also
include
activities
where
learners
can
engage
broadly
along
varied
pursuits-and
encounter
challenges
that
spur
computational
thinking
and
problem-solving
the
literature
suggests
that
learning
activities
framed
in
this
way
encourage
knowledge
construction
practice
literacies
and
seriously
impact
learner
attitudes
interest
and
perceptions
of
growth
in
the

we
address
the

4
how

shift
after

we
use
contemporary

in
the
digital

programming
education
has
become
increasingly
important
even
in
primary

however
introducing

stage
presents
unique
challenges
given
the
need
for

edm
offers
a
potential
contribution
by
predicting

a
notable
gap
in
the
current

is
its
predominant
emphasis
on
the
university
level
our
research
objectives
were
to
identify
features
influencing
primary_school
students
programming
capabilities
a
more
comprehensive
dataset
was
introduced
incorporating
psychometric
data
and
highlighting
features
such
as
learning
motivation
and
attitude
computational
thinking
data
and
other
potentially
influential
variables
which
set
our
study
apart
from
previous
studies
we
found
that
the
strongest
predictor
was
academic
performance
in
information
technology
followed
by
psychometric
data
on
students
learning
attitudes
and
motivation
computational
thinking
also
emerged
as
a
significant
feature
in
predicting
programming
performance
its
worth
highlighting
that
involvement
in
extra-curricular
activities
like
olympic
mathematics
training
showed
a
significant
association
underscoring
the
importance
of
mathematical
logic
and
reasoning
in
programming
this
is
further
bolstered
by
the
evident
correlation
with
academic
performance
in
mathematics
confirming
its
pivotal
role
in
shaping
programming
abilities
interestingly
the
correlation
of
academic
performance
in
chinese
is
also
significant
indicating
that
the
language
medium
of
instruction
can
notably
influence
success
enculturation
to
engineering
is
a
topic
of
interest
to
professional
organizations
such
as
asee
or
ieee
enculturation
can
be
understood
as
the
process
by
which
students
are
assimilated
into
the
engineering
culture
this
culture
involves
the
base
knowledge
practices
and
values
shared
by
the
community
of
practicing
engineers
both
the
culture
and
its
assimilation
are
somewhat
obscure
and
often
attributed
to
role-modeling
and
hidden
curriculum
nevertheless
undergraduate
students
are
expected
to
undergo
this
assimilation
process
and
by
the
end
of
a
five-year
program
they
behave
talk
and
do
what
engineers
do
an
approach
to
this
process
is
the
well-established
model
of
engineering
identity
this
model
of
identity
however
limits
its
scope
to
the
intrinsic
process
occurring
in
the
student
without
paying
much
attention
to
the
support
systems
expected
to
welcome
and
nurture
students
into
the
profession
enculturation
is
a
relatively
new
model
that
proposes
both
intrinsic
and
extrinsic
factors
affecting
this
assimilation
of
students
during
the
spring
of
2022
a
team
of
researchers
at
a
us
southwest
institution
applied
a
survey
to
operationalize
the
extrinsic
factors
of
a
recently
outlined
engineering
model
of
enculturation
to
understand
the
impact
of
covid
on
engineering
students
eight
likert-based
questions
were
asked
to
534
engineering
undergraduate
students
at
different
school
year
classifications
eg
sophomore
junior
or
senior
the
model
of
enculturation
tested
eight
extrinsic
factors
involving
1
engineering
design
2
teamwork
3
engineering
profession
4
ethics
5
engineering
communications
6
mathematicalphysical
modeling
7
problem-solving
and
8
algorithmiccomputational
thinking
additional
likert-based
questions
asked
students
about
the
perceived
impact
of
covid
on
their
educational
experience
the
research
questions
guiding
their
investigation
were
a
how
are
the
dimensions
of
enculturation
to
engineering
changing
across
engineering
undergraduate
classifications
and
b
how
is
enculturation
associated
with
the
covid
impact
on
students
preliminary
results
show
that
six
of
the
factors
namely
1–5
and
7
increase
by
students
school
classification
this
means
that
students
in
the
lower
years
of
their
undergraduate
program
perceive
their
enculturation
as
portrayed
by
factors
1–5
7
less
than
students
at
more
advanced
stages
of
their
program
in
terms
of
the
perceived
impact
of
covid
only
two
factors
showed
negative
correlations
with
this
perceived
impact
the
factors
were
ethics
and
algorithmiccomputational
thinking
in
other
words
the
worse
the
students
perception
of
covids
impact
on
their
educational
experience
the
less
they
endorsed
their
enculturation
in
the
impact
of
society
of
their
technical
solutions
and
their
use
of
programming
languages
while
these
results
show
encouraging
applicability
of
the
enculturation
model
it
can
only
be
considered
a
first
approach
to
a
more
fully
developed
model
the
researchers
expect
to
engage
the
fie
community
in
a
discussion
leading
to
a
more
refined
enculturation
model
the
paradigm
of
education
has
undergone
a
significant
transition
from
traditional
teacher-directed
instruction
to
student-centered
problem-based_learning
in
various
contexts
problem-based_learning
computational

approaches
have
been
used
to

it
takes
the

and
implements
the

address
the
problem
of
the

the
authors
designed
a

the
results
of
more

show
that
the
innovative
model
of
the
c

based
on
the

has
effectively
cultivated
the

in
the
past
ten
years
our

model
has
been
effectively
promoted
and
applied
in
three

with
the
growing
demand
for
the
development
of
computational

skills
the
approach
of
robotics
has
been
widely
adopted
in
schools
however
there
is
a
lack
of
adequate
and
in-depth
discussion
on
how
robotics
should
be
implemented
in
the

to
effectively
foster
the
development
of

presents
a
multidisciplinary
approach
that
integrates

within
a
historical

early
is
crucial
in
todays
digital
world
especially
in
k-12

underscored
by
the
rise
of

for
younger

however
with
limited
research
in
programming
talent
search
discovering
programming
talent
in
primary

posed
a
significant
challenge
traditionally
various
test-based
talent

tools
have
been
utilized
for
programming
talent
identification
including
the
computer
talent

test
ctst
and
the

bctt
game-based
platforms
like
codecombat
offer
an
engaging
alternative
to
overcome
this

codecombat
integrates
game-based_learning
with

allowing
students
to
apply
their
computational

in
an
enjoyable
context
for

python
the
study
revealed
a
significant
correlation
between
codecombat

this
highlighted
that
codecombat
emerged
as
a
valuable
platform
for
talent
search
aligning
seamlessly
with
the
objectives
of
the
test-based
tools
and
suggesting
its
effectiveness
in
boosting

dewey
argued
that
humankind
is
“given
to
formulating
its
beliefs
in
terms
of
either-ors
between
which
it
recognizes
no
intermediate
possibilities”
not
surprisingly
educational
computing
is
no
exception
one
such
either-or
binary
that
is
relevant
to
our
project
so
far
is
computing
vs
computational
thinking2
a
keynote
address
delivered
recently
at
a
computing
education
conference
by
the
computer
scientist
and
educator
judy
robertson
is
quite
illuminating
in
this
respect3
robertson
argued
against
a
blind
emphasis
on
computational
“thinking”
as
the
centerpiece
of
computational
literacy
focusing
only
on
creating
scratch
programs
may
lead
especially
young
learners
away
from
understanding
how
the
computer
actually
works
as
a
“machine”
childrens
drawings
of
what
is
inside
a
computer
show
that
learning
to
use
computational
abstractions
that
we
typically
introduce
in
the
k-12
levels—such
as
variables
and
loops—does
not
necessarily
help
us
understand
how
these
abstractions
are
processed
and
represented
inside
the
computer
what
gets
lost
in
our
push
to
teach
children
how
to
code
is
the
physicality
of
computing
as
a
machine
which
involves
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
the
hardware
and
software—and
many
other
forms
of
computational
abstractions
that
are
not
even
presented
to
children
as
part
of
their
experience
of
coding
or
computing
programming
and
robot
building
are
two
crucial
components
in
an
ai
curriculum
while
students
learning
goal
attainment
computational
thinking
improvement
and
autonomous
learning
improvement
are
important
dimensions
to
measure
students
learning
outcomes
in
previous
teaching
practice
virtual
simulation
platforms
are
often
used
as
teaching
aids
and
the
operational
difficulty
of
the
platforms
may
reduce
students
interest
in
learning
thus
lowering
the

therefore
based
on
the
5e

this

it
briefly
presents
gender-based
results
obtained
from

aims
to
inform

the
software
has
been
developed
for
receiving

red-light
duration
and
corresponding
to
the
length
of
the

can
be
used
to
reduce

in
addition
the
intelligent

is
also
a
social

in
this
work
in

paper
we
present
an
example
of
innovative
practice
in
organizing
informal
stem
education
workshops
with
young
children
the
workshops
were
divided
into
two
learning
scenarios
unplugged
programming
and
hands-on
robot
play
unplugged
programming
encourages
understanding
of
the
core
concepts
of
programming
such
as
algorithms
and
computational
thinking
rather
than
focusing
on
the
programming
language
in
the
second
learning
scenario
pupils
were
introduced
to
two
educational
robots
used
as
a
learning
tool
-
thymio
and
codey
rocky
the
aim
of
the
second
activity
was
linking
the
programming
concept
to
a
real-world
scenario
qualitative
and
quantitative
data
were
collected
using
pre-
and
post-
questionnaires
the
pre-questionnaires
contained
questions
about
the
pupils
background
knowledge
ie
basic
concepts
of
programming
and
robotics
the
post-questionnaires
were
designed
to
evaluate
the
workshops
impact
on
the
pupils
perception
of
these
observed
concepts
and
their
overall
satisfaction
with
the
workshops
combining
unplugged_activities
with
robots
helps
bridging
the
gap
between
imagination
and
reality
therefore
improving
learning
the
rapid
integration
of
ai
technology
and

will
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
traditional

methods
and
will
also
put

students
ai
quality
cultivation
and
application

training
are
particularly
important
based
on
the
previous

this
paper
holds
that
digital

and
deep
cognition
of
intelligent
society
are
the
important
contents
of
ai

three
aspects
as
well
as

strategy
and
points
out
that
normal

educational
robotics
is
a
practice
that
has
been
disseminated
in
brazil
and
in
the

allowing
the
inclusion
of

through
stimulating
pedagogical
activities
for

making
them
practice
teamwork
fine
motor
coordination
and
computational
thinking
among
other
benefits
for
the
educational
robotics
classes
to
be
executed
in
the
most
effective
way
the
teacher
must
be
trained
to
use
this
tool
and
from
there
propose
andor
execute
classes
that
use
the
technology
to
help
in
the
teaching
of
curricular
subjects
in
basic
education
however
many
teachers
do
not
realize
what
can
be
possible
with
robotics
in
the
classroom
and
this
often
causes
them
not
to
choose
to
learn
more
about
this
technology
in
this
work
we
developed
a
web
system
called
repo-educ
in
which
a
teacher
can
access
information
about
robotics
lessons
created
by
other
teachers
generating
ideas
about
how
to
apply
robotics
in
their
classroom
using
this
system
it
is
possible
to
transform
robotics
education
by
combining
knowledge
even
teachers
who
have
never
had
contact
with
robotics
can
start
using
this
technology
in
the
classroom
by
replicating
lessons
that
are
proven
to
work
by
other
teachers
the
system
is
in
the
final
stages
of
development
to
be
made
available
to
the
educational
robotics
community
in
recent

we
have
seen
a
real
explosion
of

increasingly
become
common
in
an
ever
growing
number
of

in
our
work
but
also
in
our

the
need
not
just
to
acquire

but
also
to

computation
is
becoming
an
integral
part
of
education
especially
at
college-level
two
mooc
courses
provide
an
introduction
to
computation
and
are
offered
by
mit
on
edx
6001x
introduction
to
computer
science
programming
in
python
has
run
16
times
and
6002x
introduction
to
computational
thinking
and
data
science
has
run
11
times
these
courses
frame
the
world
around
computation
and
show
learners
that
they
can
think
about
problems
they
see
in
everyday
life
in
the
context
of
computation
our
paper
shows
an
analysis
of
repeat
learners
learners
who
enroll
in
the
same
course
multiple
times
and
their
behaviors
over
the
many
runs
of
these
courses
around
20
of
learners
in
any
given
run
of
a
course
are
repeat
learners
of
these
the
majority
are
two-time
repeat
learners
learners
who
took
the
same
course
exactly
twice
we
show
that
learners
tend
to
perform
better
when
they
retake
a
course
and
especially
when
they
retake
the
course
sooner
rather
than
later
we
also
look
at
a
subgroup
of
learners
we
call
repeat
cross-referencers
learner
who
accessed
at
least
two
previous
runs
of
the
course
during
the
run
time
of
a
later
run
of
the
course
we
found
that
repeat
cross-referencers
complete
the
course
at
a
suspiciously
high
rate
and
we
speculate
it
is
because
they
are
looking
back
at
answers
from
a
previous
course
run
lastly
we
look
at
how
learners
perform
in
an
introductory
class
and
an
advanced
class
we
found
that
many
learners
who
take
both
courses
are
more
likely
to
complete
both
courses
and
have
more
active
days
in
the
courses
than
those
learners
who
only
do
one
of
the
two
classes
computational
thinking
in
recent
years
has
been
universally
defined
as
the
”new
english”
or
basic
knowledge
necessary
for
everyone
as
english
is
important
to
include
it
as
early
as
possible
in
teaching
programs
right
from
preschool
this
need
is
so
felt
as
to
make
it
for
example
compulsory
in
kindergarten
in
italy
since
2022
obviously
this
implies
the
use
of
simple
tools
that
do
not
provide
reading
and
writing
skills
this
work
proposes
a
learning
program
which
could
be
carried
out
precisely
during
the
three
years
of
kindergarten
from
3
to
6
years
of
age
and
prepares
children
for
coding
a
teaching
subject
that
has
already
been
proposed
in
italy
for
primary_school
since
a
few
years
in
this
paper
we
call
for
computational
archival
studies
to
prioritize
social
justice
and
community-centeredness
our
initial
research
findings
as
well
as
the
work
of

archives
provide
evidence
of
the
need
to
elevate
and
truly
center
the
voices
of
those
depicted
or
underrepresented
in
large-scale

the
power
of

we
can
see
that
computer

is
a
good
technology
for

and
can
bring
many
benefits
to
the

also
deepening
into
legal

so
that

can
be
transformed
from

with
the
objective
of
identifying
how
ai
teaching-learning
processes
are
carried
out
from

were
obtained
between
2016-2021
where
eleven
countries
are
identified
with
ai
teaching
initiatives
through
workshops

plays
a
vital
role
in

in
this
study
we
examined
the
emotional
changes
of
69
students
during
the
lectures
of
the
c
language
programming
foundation
and
computational

in
central
china
this
paper
presents
a
method
using
yolov7
and
the
convolutional

to
monitor
students
emotional
evolution
by
analyzing
their
facial
expressions
and
recognizing
academic
affective
states
including
boring
confused
focus
happy
and
neutral
the
trained
model
has
achieved
a
test
accuracy
of
760
the
results
showed
that
focus
increased
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
10
minutes
of
class
and
then
began
to
decline
with
the
decline
of
focus
emotion
students
neutral
emotions
increased
we
found
that
when
a
new
teaching
session
is
performed
or
the
teaching
method
of
naming
questions
is
used
the
students
emotion
of
focus
increases
briefly
lasting
about
8–10
minutes
subsequently
even
if
the
varied
teaching
method
was
used
to
stimulate
students
attention
their
level
of
engagement
did
not
increase
significantly
it
can
be
suggested
that
teachers
can
use
teaching
methods
appropriately
to
promote
students
attention
however
students
attention
span
is
limited
and
teachers
should
pay
attention
to
methods
and
time
to
improve
teaching
quality
effectively
this
paper
discusses
how
a
connection
between
programming
and
creative
work
in
terms
of
visual
and
interactive
art
can
be
of
interest
in
the
educational
context
of
learning
programming
there
are
strong
indications
that
a
creative
approach
in
programming
allows
to
pay
attention
to
institutional
and
social
requirements
concerning
computer
science
education
this
includes
the
students
interest
and
motivation
as
well
as
their
performance
and
knowledge
acquisition
even
though
this
has
been
discussed
before
this

presents
a
first
basic
structure
of
a

enabling
an
integration
of
creative
coding
as
an
additional
path
for
teaching
computer

are
identified
and
connected
to
the
concepts
of

it
consists
of
three
layers
core

is
concerned
with
two
fundamental

however
teaching
and
learning
programming
in
primary

involve
different
knowledge
including
complex
mathematical
concepts
and
programming
syntax
also
traditional
teaching
methods
may
not
effectively
cater
for

thus
learning
difficulties
are
common
among

have
been
created
to
assist
students
in
learning
mathematics
robots
have
been
regarded
as
an
especially
powerful
tool
to
help
students
master
mathematics
since
students
can
simultaneously
learn

although
a
number
of
educational
robots
and
curricula
have
been
developed
some
of
them
do
not
comply
with
math
standards
so
they
are
primarily
suitable
for
after-school
programs
camps
or
workshops
students
might
not
be
able
to
focus
on
learning

now
that
writing
a

might
be
difficult
for
them
due
to

it
is
expected
that
the
curricula
based
on
roboblocky
will
continue
to
be
improved
to
enable
more
middle

the
first
approach
programming
is
directly
related
to

to
achieve
a
project
related
to
the

has
become
pervasive
across
many
technical

is
a
persistent
problem
in

the
second
and
third
stages
detail
the
development
of

in
its
two
versions
and
the
final
stage
lays
the
foundation
for
a
quasi-experimental
study
involving
students
in
the
curriculum
activities
of

findings
the
preliminary
results
of
this
work
are
promising
as
two
functional
prototypes
of
tutorbot
have
been
developed
for
both
the
non-conversational
and

versions
additionally
there
is
ongoing
exploration
into
the
possibility
of
creating
a
domain-specific
model
based
on

with
other
platforms
and
designing
an
experiment
to
measure

and
the
tool’s
effectiveness
the

language
python
is
simple
and
easy
to
learn
and
is
used
for
students
with
no
prior
background
in

several
colleges
and
universities
teach
python
to
students
who
are
learning
a
programming

for
the
first
time
in
this

we
present
a
curricular
model
for
introducing
through
active
learning
strategies
data
analytics
concepts
and
applications
into
an
introductory
computer

we
have
designed
the
course
to
use
a
variety
of
hands-on
laboratory
projects
that
use
the
python
programming
language
and
associated
tools
while
introducing
students
to
an
important
research
area
we
believe
the
use
of
these
projects
improves
students’
learning
experiences
enables
them
to
apply
and
relate
fundamental
computational
thinking
concepts
of
algorithmic
reasoning
data
representation
and
computational
efficiency
to
data
analytics
problems
assessment
results
show
that
introducing

can
adapt
what
they
are
learning
in
any

applied
in
almost
every
domain
of

a
thorough
understanding
of
complex
ai
algorithm
is
required
the
idea
behind
the
ai
algorithm
simulator
was
born
from
the
recognition
that
algorithms
are
a
critical
component
of
a
person’s
computational

and
programming
abilities
despite
their
complexity
our
ai
algorithm
simulator
seeks
to
make
the
subject
more
accessible
and
engaging
for

the
ai
algorithm
simulator
is
designed
to
be
both
interactive
and
visually
appealing
providing

however
if
the

was
demonstrated
to
them
using

was
hacked
then
there
is
a
good
chance
they
can
get
attracted
towards
technology

iot
is
a
topic
to
interest
new
learners
in
programming
given
the
fact
that
there
are
already
plenty
of
tools
eg
microbit
and
arduino
designed
to
make
iot
programming
simple
and
full
of

it
is
usually
believed
that
adopting
iot
topics
is
beneficial
for
younger
students
learning
how
to
program
however
younger
students’
learning
performance
in
programming
courses
varies
dramatically
depending
on
the
tools
mentioned
above
there
are
many
metrics
to
predict
the
academic
achievements
of
young

as
such
understanding
the

the
central
problem
we
faced
in
restructuring
our
introductory

was
finding
a
game
genre
that
could
support
creative
coding
for
beginners
be
motivational
and
recognizable
by
the
students
and
would
work
with
our

are
an
effective
way
to
provide
scaffolding
and
ease
non-technical
students
into

programming
the
genre
has
good
expressive
power
and
the
students
were
motivated
because
they
recognized

the
validation
of
the
method
is
performed
through
the
assessment
of
the

of
primary_school
students
to
programming
exercises
using
a
programming
language
called
lie
the
method
assesses

using
several
techniques
such
as
the
analysis
of

structures
code
clones
and
the
execution
of
code
based
on
input

output
values
defined
during
the

arduino
in
the
field
of
education
starts
in
2010
until
today
the
communications
in
the
congresses
to
present
the
results
of
the
investigations
developed
are
the
most
used
means
of
diffusion
the
national
university
of
distance
education
and
the
lucian
blaga
university
of
sibiu
are
particularly
noteworthy
the
authors
with
more
scientific
production
in
this
field
of
study
are
bogdan
m
and
castro
m
it
is
significant
that
the
collection
of
studies
on
this
subject
is
carried
out
above
all
by
edulearn
proceedings
and
inted
proceedings
it
can
be
concluded
that
the
field
of
study
on
arduino
in
the
educational
field
is
relatively
recent
so
that
today
the
basis
for
scientific
research
is
still
being
established
however
the
most
relevant
aspects
in
this
field
of
study
are
physic
experiments
computational
thinking
and
computer-based
learning
steam
education
is
nowadays
a
key
element
for
our
current
digital
society
integrating
steam
and
developing
competences
such
as
computational
thinking
is
highly
demanded
by
the
industry
and
higher_education
institutions
in
order
to
do
so
new
methodological
approaches
are
required
robosteam
project
is
an
erasmus
project
defined
to
address
these
topics
by
using
of
physical
devices
and
robotics
employing
challenge
based
learning
methodology
one
of
the
first
steps
in
the
project
development
is
the
definition
of
current
landscape
in
the
research
field
which
means
to
carry
out
a
literature
mapping
that
considers
previous
applications
of
challenge
based
learning
in
steam
education
and
use
of
robots
and
physical
devices
to
do
so
this
paper
shows
the
mapping
review
process
and
the
main
results
obtained
the
mapping
analyze
242
candidate
works
from
the
most
relevant
bibliographic
sources
and
selected
54
form
them
it
was
possible
to
see
that
there
are
not
many
initiatives
on
stem
education
related
to
challenge
base
learning
and
the
most
of
them
are
specially
focused
on
the
application
of
specific
tools
and
in
the
development
of
concrete
competences
the
pedagogy
of
science
technology
engineering
arts
and
mathematics
steam
can
be
easily
developed
by
using
robotics
and
computational
thinking
tools
also
inclusion
and
integration
of
diverse
groups
of
students
can
be
promoted
using
these
tools
today
we
can
find
many
tools
for
teaching
robotics
this
kind
of
tools
allow
us
to
promote
innovation
and
motivation
of
students
in
this
way
students
will
be
able
to
work
during
the
learning
process
in
an
innovative
and
motivating
way
since
it
is
increasingly
common
to
find
robots
in
our
daily
lives
it
is
important
to
integrate
robots
into
education
as
well
there
are
already
cooking
robots
autonomous
cars
vacuum
cleaner
robots
in
houses
and
gardens
or
prostheses
this
paper
describes
a
course
focused
on
a
combination
of
teaching
methodologies
educational
robotics
tools
and
a
student
learning
management
methodology
all
within
an
inclusive
framework
to
strengthen
the
presence
of
women
and
other
under-represented
groups
in
engineering
introducing
coding
in
early
education
improves
the
logical
and
computational
thinking
in
kids
however
cognitive
skills
are
not
sufficient
for
a
successful
life
understanding
and
managing
the
emotions
of
oneself
is
another
crucial
factor
in
success
the
current
state
of
the
art
teaching
methods
educates
the
kids
about
programming
and
emotional
intelligence
independently
in
our
opinion
it
is
advantageous
to
teach
kids
emotional
intelligence
along
with
the
programming
concepts
however
the
literature
lacks
the
studies
that
make
students
emotionally
aware
while
teaching
them
programming
this
research
aims
to
prepare
students
to
be
cognitively
healthy
as
well
as
emotionally
intelligent
with
the
hypothesis
that
a
kids
emotional
intelligence
can
be
enhanced
while
teaching
them
cognitive
skills
we
proposed
a
computational
model
that
teaches
programming
and
emotional
intelligence
side
by
side
to
students
the
model
provides
a
curriculum
and
related
tools
for
evaluations
five
hundred
students
of
a
public
school
were
involved
in
different
activities
to
find
the
effectiveness
of
the
proposed
model
these
students
were
divided
into
five
groups
a
b
c
d
and
e
each
having
a
mean
age
of
4
5
6
7
and
8
years
respectively
students
performed
multiple
adaptive
scenarios
of
path-finding
that
were
based
on
self-awareness
social-awareness
sharing
and
empathy
emotions
students
provide
the
programming
instructions
such
as
sequencing
conditional
statements
and
looping
to
a
robot
the
children
have
successfully
improved
in
both
fundamental
programming
constructs
and
emotional
intelligence
skills
the
research
also
successfully
reduced
screen
time
problem
by
providing
a
screen-free
student
interface
educational
digital
storytelling
is
widely
recognised
as
a
powerful
approach
in
developing
literary
skills
experiencing
problem-solving
and
computational
thinking
information
and
knowledge
visualisation
building
creativity
and
divergent
thinking
supported
by
technological
solutions
however
educators
feel
that
they
miss
opportunities
skills
and
tools
to
support
pupils
developing
creativity
hence
we
proposed
a
digital
learning
environment
named
novelette
to
support
both
educators
and
learners
in
performing
visual
storytelling
by
scaffolding
them
in
inventing
and
authoring
stories
the
main
novelty
of
our
approach
lies
in
embedding
literary
artifices
widely
explored
in
learning
settings
into
a
digital
learning
environment
such
as
the
opportunity
to
continue
someone
else’s
story
and
the
suggestion
mechanism
to
explore
analogies
or
synonyms
starting
from
a
word
of
interest
novelette
has
been
ideated
not
only
as
a
learning
environment
for
educators
but
with
educators
as
it
results
from
a
user-centered
and
participatory
design
methodology
to
involve
them
in
the
entire
design
and
development
process
actively
this
paper
focuses
on
the
assessment
of
novelette
usability
according
to
both
educators
and
pupils
as
a
conclusive
step
of
the
co-design
approach
developers
tested
the
resulting
usability
according
to
educators
in
a
controlled
environment
moreover
it
reports
usability
according
to
learners
in
real
settings
at
school
results
demonstrate
that
novelette
is
considered
usable
by
both
target
groups
and
it
is
perceived
as
a
powerful
approach
in
developing
creativity
both
according
to
quantitative
insight
offered
by
the
system
usability
scale
aka
sus
and
qualitative
interpretations
enabled
with
direct
observations
and
structured
after
scenario
questionnaires
we
can
conclude
that
novelette
is
a
pleasant
and
usable
tool
to
invent
and
author
stories
and
seems
to
be
a
promising
approach
to
develop
creativity
from
time
immemorial
stories
have
caught
the
fascination
of
young
and
old
rural
children
in
india
in
particular
have
a
natural
way
of
telling
stories
that
are
rooted
in
their
heritage
of
social
norms
values
and
belief
systems
that
are
compelling
and
emotionally
engaging
the
process
of
writing
and
narrating
their
own
stories
enhances
their
verbal
proficiency
and
makes
them
reflect
deeply
upon
the
story
theme
thereby
enabling
them
to
develop
higher-order
thinking
in
this
research
study
the
author
used
stories
to
introduce
physical
computing
and
robotics
to
children
in
rural
india
in
a
personally
meaningful
manner
children
created
interactive
cultural
dioramas
based
on
classical
stories
from
indian
folklore
with
robotic
puppets
that
they
programmed
using
the
scratch
programming
language
they
learned
21st-century
skills
of
creativity
communication
collaboration
and
critical_thinking
by
working
in
groups
wherein
they
learned
to
divide
tasks
manage
time
work
together
debate
the
pros
and
cons
of
different
ideas
listen
think
out
of
the
box
and
be
active
and
engaged
the
author
observed
that
such
an
intervention
improved
the
childrens
sense
of
agency
and
their
interest
in
robotics
and
computational
thinking
the
author
presents
her
results
from
pilot
studies
conducted
in
2019
from
two
semi-urban
schools
in
india
on
the
childrens
perception
of
creating
robots
programming
tinkering
with
electronics
career
in
robotics
and
the
workshop
experience
itself
-
all
of
which
suggests
that
the
children
were
deeply
engaged
and
enthusiastic
throughout
the
workshop
making
the
entire
learning
experience
a
meaningful
and
joyful
one
for
all
the
results
indicate
that
such
culturally
sensitive
interventions
can
help
children
from
collectivistic
cultures
embrace
technology
while
preserving
their
traditional
identities
and
cultural
cohesion
difficulties
in
teaching
and
learning
introductory
programming
have
been
studied
over
the
years
the
students’
difficulties
lead
to
failure
lack
of
motivation
and
abandonment
of
courses
the
problem
is
more
significant
in
computer
courses
where
learning
programming
is
essential
programming
is
difficult
and
requires
a
lot
of
work
from
teachers
and
students
programming
is
a
process
of
transforming
a
mental
plan
into
a
computer
program
the
main
goal
of
teaching
programming
is
for
students
to
develop
their
skills
to
create
computer
programs
that
solve
real
problems
there
are
several
factors
that
can
be
at
the
origin
of
the
problem
such
as
the
abstract
concepts
that
programming
implies
the
skills
needed
to
solve
problems
the
mental
skills
needed
to
decompose
problems
many
of
the
students
never
had
the
opportunity
to
practice
computational
thinking
or
programming
students
must
know
the
syntax
semantics
and
structure
of
a
new
unnatural
language
in
a
short
period
of
time
in
this
work
we
present
a
set
of
strategies
included
in
an
application
with
the
objective
of
helping
teachers
and
students
early
identification
of
potential
problems
and
prompt
response
is
critical
to
preventing
student
failure
and
reducing
dropout
rates
this
work
also
describes
a
predictive
machine
learning
neural
network
model
of
student
failure
based
on
the
student
profile
which
is
built
over
the
course
of
programming
lessons
by
continuously
monitoring
and
evaluating
student
activities
many
educational
institutions
have
modified
their
curricula
to
include
computational
thinking
and
coding
courses
for
all
students
however
it
is
not
always
easy
to
engage
non-cs
students
in
coding
hackathons
are
often
suggested
as
tools
for
exposing
people
to
fun
real
challenges
promoting
alternative
ways
of
learning
and
increasing
their
interest
in
coding
and
cs
in
general
thus
we
ask
could
a
hackathon
be
used
specifically
within
a
cs1
class
to
motivate
students
and
boost
their
performance
measured
in
grades
in
this
article
we
analyze
data
from
1253
students
before
and
after
an
educational
hackathon
observing
changes
in
motivation
towards
the
class
and
ultimately
the
students’
grades
we
discovered
that
although
there
are
variations
in
motivation
and
performance
on
those
attending
the
pyweekend
either
as
participants
or
attendants
general
public
it
is
difficult
to
conclude
that
those
variations
are
solely
caused
by
the
hackathon
we
also
include
suggestions
as
how
to
extend
this
study
to
further
understand
the
effects
of
hackathons
on
the
motivation
and
grades
of
cs1
students
full

one
of
the
biggest
challenges
in
education
is
the
transfer
of
innovations
and
new
didactic
approaches
into
the
school
system
to
ensure
a
high
standard
of
teaching
it
is
essential
that
the
teachers
expertise
pedagogical
content
knowledge
as
well
as
digital
competences
are
continuously
improved
by
further
training
in-service
training
for
teachers
is
offered
in
different
settings
short-
middle-
and
long
term
with
advantages
and
disadvantages
two
aspects
that
correlate
positively
are
the
costs
and
the
sustainable
outcome
of
these
trainings
with
these
aspects
in
mind
the
educational
pyramid
scheme
eps
is
currently
being
developed
and
implemented
as
part
of
an
erasmus
plus
project
it
is
an
innovative
concept
that
aims
at
spreading
new
learning
contents
and
methods
in
a
relatively
short
time
within
the
school
system
with
low
costs
and
high
effect
it
is
inspired
by
the
economical
pyramid
scheme
which
is
designed
to
create
value
through
the
exploitation
of
business
opportunities
the
transaction
content
of
the
educational
pyramid
scheme
refers
to
methods
or
strategies
that
are
being
exchanged
and
to
the
resources
and
capabilities
that
are
required
to
enable
the
exchange
according
to
a
train-the-trainer
principle
teachers
and
pupils
will
be
qualified
to
be
trainers
who
then
spread
their
knowledge
and
skills
to
people
in
their
school
and
beyond
the
eps
contains
three
different

pupils
the
motivation
to
participate
is
maintained
with
a
benefit
system
adapted
for
each

the

of
target
groups
follows
high
qualitative
standards
and
therefore
presents
different
phases
input
practical
phase
and
reflection
this
paper
describes
the
development
of
the
eps
and
its
first
implementation
in
the
framework
of
the
austrian
mandatory
curriculum
the
idea
behind
this
work
is
to
start
exploring
the
application
of
data
analytics
and
explainable
machine
learning
techniques
to
better
understand
games
and
discover
new
features
that
will
possibly
help
in
effectively
exploiting
them
in
different
socially
useful
domains
we
prove
the
feasibility
of
the
idea
by
i
collecting
a
large
dataset
of
board
game
information
ii
designing
and
testing
an
information
processing
pipeline
for
automatically
discovering
game
categories
and
game
mechanics
with
some
first
encouraging
results
in
the
future
we
plan
to
further
generalize
this
approach
for
different
kinds
of
games
and
for
discovering
currently
unknown
but
useful
aspects
eg
games
or
game
features
that
could
better
foster
computational
thinking
in
education
those
better
suited
to
be
applied
in
social
distancing
contexts
and
so
on
whilst
there
has
been
growing
interest
in
the
use
of
social
robots
in
educational
settings
the
majority
of
this
research
focuses
on
learning
outcomes
with
less
emphasis
on
the
social
processes
surrounding
these
interactions
one
such
understudied
factor
is
children’s
trust
in
the
robot
as
a
teacher
trust
is
a
relevant
domain
in
that
if
and
how
children
trust
a
robot
could
influence
their
subsequent
learning
outcomes
the
extent
to
which
the
robot’s
behaviour
including
making
errors
influences
trust
is
yet
to
be
fully
explored
consequently
the
goal
of
this
research
is
to
determine
the
role
of
trust
in
children’s
learning
from
social
robots
we
report
a
pilot
study
investigating
the
conceptualisation
and
measurement
of
chil-dren’s
trust
in
robots
33
children
aged
between
4-9
completed
a
computational
thinking
learning
task
with
a
nao
robot
at
a
science
festival
observations
of
the
interactions
in
terms
of
developing
tasks
and
measurements
for
child
robot
interaction
are
discussed
the
findings
tentatively
suggest
children’s
trust
in
the
robot
can
be
divided
into
two
parts
social
affiliation
towards
the
robot
and
perceived
competencereliability
of
the
robot
in
advance
to
the
present
study
the
authors
introduced
a
method
which
makes
it
possible
to
calculate
the
entropy
of
natural
language
digital
texts
focusing
on
word-processed
texts
presentations
and
webpages
this
entropy
reveals
that
the
more
underdeveloped
documents
are
the
more
demanding
their
content-related
modification
becomes
it
was
also
found
that
the
time
and
data
required
to
complete
a
modification
task
in
an
erroneous
document
is
several
times
more
than
in
its
correct
counterpart
this
finding
leads
to
the
end-user
paradox
the
less
trained
end-users
are
the
more
errors
they
make
and
the
modification
of
their
documents
requires
more
resources
to
resolve
these
discrepancies
the
present
study
defines
the
sustainability
rate
of
natural
language
digital
texts
which
calculates
the
losses
–
the
waste
of
human
resources
time
workspace
computers
energy
frustration
working
in
bees
losing
data
–
generated
by
negligent
text
management
furthermore
we
present
examples
of
how
manual
and
enumerated
lists
behave
to
modifications
in
a
213-page
long
document
and
conclude
from
our
investigations
that
while
the
waste
of
human
and
machine
resources
occurs
repeatedly
in
erroneous
documents
the
sustainability
rate
remains
low
to
prove
the
necessity
of
correction
we
cleared
the
sample
document
which
took
approximately
67
hours
of
two
experts
of
our
research
group
2times67
hours
with
this
method
we
found
that
the
correction
of
errors
can
be
extremely
demanding
but
uses
resources
only
once
and
further
modifications
in
the
now
correct
document
need
only
the
content-required
amount
of
time
activities
entropy
and
resources
in
accordance
with
the
expectations
of
the
person
intended
to
update
the
document
to
correct
documents
we
present
the
error
recognition
model
which
is
proved
effective
and
efficient
in
digital
education
all
our
findings
indicate
that
both
education
and
industry
should
adapt
the
presented
approach
1
to
develop
students’
and
end-users’
computational
thinking
skills
2
to
manage
and
take
advantage
of
errors
3
to
recognize
connections
between
the
structure
of
the
text
and
the
complex
word
processing
tools
4
to
pay
attention
to
digital
sustainability
–
beyond
hardware
and
software
development
and
recycling
–
with
a
focus
on
the
human
factor
recently
the
error
recognition
model
is
a
reactive
problem-solving
approach
whose
effectiveness
is
justified
however
the
near
future
is
to
run
parallel
the
reactive
and
proactive
uses
of
this
approach
while
if
we
look
far
into
the
future
the
proactive
use
to
digital
born
natural
language
texts
should
dominate
scratch
is
a
popular
programming
platform
with
plenty
of
learning
resources
however
it
is
quite
difficult
for
users
to
find
suitable
resources
in
this

then
on
the
basis
of

we
calculate

we
present
a

we
put
forward
a

function
to
obtain

for

can
calculate

have
started
introducing

to
counter
the

we
argue

on
introductory

as
computer

cs
becomes
increasingly
popular
in
the
world
of
big

more
college
students
are
taking
introductory
cs
courses
to
follow
the
trend
however
students
have
different
levels
of
exposure
to
cs
when
they
start
cs
in
college
varying
from
no
experience
to
years
of
coding
experience
this
disparity
in
the
amount
of
exposure
can
pose
many
problems
in
the
same
intro-level
class
some
students
may
think
they
do
not
learn
anything
new
while
others
believe
the
professor
goes
through
concepts
so
fast
that
they
cannot
follow
the
pace
cs
professors
may
also
feel
confused
about
how
to
control
the
pace
and
content
of
introductory
courses
therefore
cs
departments
need
an
assessment
to
measure
students’
cs
knowledge
and
then
assign
them
to
the
appropriate
cs
introductory
courses
though
a
vast

that
are
widely

this
has
recently
been
reflected
in
various
university

where
courses
such
as
computational

and
basic

classes
are
now
included
in
a
broader
range
of
non-computer-science
programs
however
these
programs
often
face
challenges
in
such
courses
due
to
their
diverse
student
body
with
students
often
lacking
profound
digital
competencies
and
technical

while
gender

aspects
have
been
broadly
studied
in
the
past
other

dimensions
such

have
largely
been

in
this

we
report
on
our

course
to
first-year
business
informatics
bachelor

after
undergoing
fundamental
changes
in

we
explore
what

factors
play
an
important
role
when
teaching

to
non-computer

students
and
how

is
perceived
by

our
analysis
confirms
that
a

concept
positively
supports

has
been
developed
for

aiming
to
analyze

of
two
different

and
towards
this
approach
four
different

focuses
on
either
creating

concepts
teaching
programming
is
a
topic
that
has
generated
a
high
level
of
interest
among
researchers
in
recent
decades
in
particular
multiple
approaches
to
teaching
visual
programming
have
been
explored
from
the
use
of
tools
such
as
scratch
robots
unplugged
programming
or
activities
for
the
development
of
computational
thinking
despite
the
wide
range
of
resources
used
students
generally
tend
to
perform
poorly
academically
and
perceive
learning
visual
programming
as
a
complex
and
demotivating
task
in
this
article
the
tutoapp
system
is
proposed
together
with
a
new
methodology
based
on
“learning
by
teaching”
where
students
create
tutorials
on
their
mobile
devices
to
explain
programming
concepts
to
their
peers
the
hypothesis
of
this
article
is
that
the
use
of
this
tool
improves
learning
outcomes
and
the
level
of
student
satisfaction
an

the
findings
indicate
that
the

significantly
improved

academic
performance
over
those
who
did
not
use
it
specifically
in
learning
the

however
it
was
observed
that
anxiety
increased
in
all
students
while
learning
visual

the
results
of
this

open
the
door
to
the
validation
of
the

increased
the
importance
of
information
technology-related

are
essential
in

nowadays
thus
programming

has
become
necessary
to
cultivate

the
rapid
pace
of

programming
learning
encourages
students
to
think
logically
and
systematically
solve
problems
effectively
and
develop
computational
thinking
skills
however
learning
programming
is
challenging
for
many
students
for
different
reasons
such
as
its
inherent
complexity
inadequate
study
methods
and
pedagogical
approaches
unsuited
to
promote
programming
learning
traditional
teaching
methods
are
often
impersonalized
and
only
suitable
for
some
learning
styles
present
in
class
moreover
the
challenges
encountered
by
the
students
as
novice
programmers
are
attributed
to
their
low
learning
motivation
to
learn
to
program
students
must
comprehend
different
syntactic
conventions
complex
instructions
and
logical
operators
and
actively
engage
in
practical
learning
activities
often
facing
difficulties
this
may
reduce
their
learning
motivation
leading
to
failure
and
dropout
to
accommodate
different
learning
styles
and
increase
students
motivation
this
study
employed
the
arcs
motivation
model
to
design
various
innovative
activities
in
a
flipped_classroom
setting
to
increase

students
to
compare
the
effectiveness
of
teaching

revealed
that
the

showed
significantly
higher

pre-studies
analyzing
students
perspectives
regarding
the
inclusion
of
digital
competences
in
the
teacher
education
program
of
a
large
central-european
university
revealed
that
less
than
half
of
the
students
who
were
at
an
advanced
stage
in
their
studies
felt
sufficiently
prepared
to
impart
digital
competences
in
their
daily
teaching
given
the
importance
of
being
digitally
competent
in
the
modern
digital
era
the
question
arises
how
digital
competences
can
be
sustainably
included
in
the
curriculum
of
a
teacher
education
program
this
paper
analyzes
interviews
with
five
faculty
members
successfully
teaching
digital
skills
in
concert
with
subject
didactics
of
geography
in
order
to
identify
best
practices
for
the
integration
of
digital

the
first
author
asked
our
interview
partners
to
provide
insight
into
the
content
they
mediated
the
integration
of
digital
competences
and
tools
in
their
courses
how
their
teaching
could
be
further
improved
and
what
challenges
they
encounter
eventually
we
looked
for
best
practices
and
collected
instructors
thoughts
on
improvements
on
a
curricular
level
and
examples
of
transferring
the
good
practices
to
other
subjects
such
that
future
students
could
benefit
from
a
better
integration
of
digital
competences
for
this
paper
we
analyzed
the
data
with
a
mixture
of
narrative
analysis
and
thematic
analysis
improving
the
mediating
of
digital
skills
and
competences
in
a
wider
range
of
subjects
at
the
university
level
should
eventually
help
students
and
ultimately
their
students
to
implement
digital
know-how
such
as
modern
teaching
tools
into
their
courses
making
teaching
more
effective
and
computational
thinking
as
well
as
related
fields
of
computing
more
accessible
to
academic
as
well
as
secondary
and
younger
students
the
research
so
far
has
shown
promising
results
considering
examples
of
tools
that
can
be
used
on
a
broad
spectrum
of
subjects
and
lead
to
a
factor
of
learned
new
digital
competences
if
used
properly
on
the
other
hand
lecturers
also
warned
about
relying
too
much
on
technology
in
specific
tasks
such
as
orientation
on
a
map
or
analyzing
statistical
data
we
conclude
that
combining
existing
approaches
with
new
more
modern
didactics
can
be
the
key
to
transferring
the
competencies
required
for
our
students

this
document
presents
a
systematic
review
of
visual
programming
tools
for
the
arduino
board
the
arduino
board
is
an
embedded
platform
that
focus
on
enabling
an
easy
way
to
teach
embedded
systems
but
due
to
its
success
it
ended
up
being
used
in
different
teaching
levels
ranging
from
primary
to
university
the
board
was
also
applied
in
the
teaching
of
robotics
and
other
contexts
since
it
is
relatively
cheap
easy
to
program
and
its
community
has
produced
a
considerable
amount
of
free
educational
material
even
though
arduino
is
a
success
it
is
still
maturing
in
terms
of
educational
purposes
aside
the
electronic
knowledge
that
needs
to
be
explored
the
board
is
programmed
by
default
with
c
which
is
considered
not
friendly
to
computer
thinking
beginners
trying
to
solve
this
problem
many
solutions
apply
visual
programming
which
is
proven
to
make
it
easy
for
unexperienced
and
even
children
to
learn
the
basis
of
computational
thinking
in
the
educational
context
with
arduino
even
though
there
are
many
solutions
applying
visual
programming
for
arduino
there
are
no
systematic
review
or
survey
on
this
subject
meaning
that
it
is
hard
to
identify
where
are
the
gaps
and
which
are
the
problems
that
are
already
solved
therefore
on
this
paper
it
was
performed
a
systematic
review
on
the
subject
the
method
found
372
papers
which
31
were
selected
for
full
review
the
reviewed
solutions
where
discussed
and
categorized
we
expect
that
the
presented
results
could
be
used
as
guideline
for
new
research
in
the
area
and
by
educators
and
companies
that
are

undergraduate
software
engineering
courses
typically
require
students
to
work
on
team-based
projects
that
reinforce
disciplinary
content
and
soft
skills
at
the
same
time
these
students
particularly
those
at
liberal
arts
institutions
are
required
to
take
courses
that
focus
on
civic
issues
including
on
racial
and
ethnic
inequality
often
students
perceive
these
courses
to
be
outside
their
disciplinary
areas
and
may
not
comprehend
how
these
topics
are
applicable
to
computer
science
and
software
engineering
this
paper
reports
on
the
experience
of
pulimood
and
leigey
as
they
and
their
students
grappled
with
issues
of
racial
injustice
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
drew
upon
their
own
disciplinary
backgrounds
to
apply
computational
thinking
and
software
engineering
principles
to
help
the
community
better
understand
these
issues
and
advocate
for
reform
the
paper
also
describes
the
experience
of
teaching
courses
from
different
disciplines
in
a
collaborative
model
working
closely
with
a
local
community
partner
to
support
its
work
on
an
identified
social

and
the
learning
outcomes
as
well
as
the
benefits
and
challenges
of
this
approach
recommendations

future
directions
are
also
discussed
today
teaching
faces
several
challenges
including
students’
difficulty
in
understanding
abstract
concepts
and
lack
of
motivation
to
address
these
problems
the
use
of
virtual
reality
vr
has
been
explored
as
an
innovative
and
potentially
effective
educational
tool
however
so
far
the
effectiveness
of
vr
applications
and
the
perception
of
their
use
lack
a
clear
and
effective
approach
to
be
used
to
support
education
the
importance
of
addressing
this
problem
lies
in
the
need
to
improve
the
quality
of
teaching
using
emerging
technologies
it
is
for
this
reason
that
it
is
important
to
find
new
strategies
to
improve
the
effectiveness
of
teaching
using
vr
in
this
context
this
research
presents
the
results
of
the
freedev
application
previously
validated
with
20
teachers
and
with
80
engineering
students
from
a
private
university
freedev
is
a
vr
application
designed
to
support
the
teaching
of
basic

it
is
aimed
as
an
educational
tool
to
provide
an
immersive
experience
to
students
on
how
to
get
started
in
programming
and
computational

freedev
has
been
well
accepted
and
both
teachers
and
engineering
students
see
it
as
a
tool
that
can
be
used
to
support
education
it
is
hoped
that
this
research
will
contribute
to
the
advancement
of
knowledge
in
the
field
of
education
there
is
a
saying
“everything
changes
but
nothing
changes”
we
are
realizing
a
rapid
technological
revolution
in
the
development
deployment
and
application
of
computing
technologies
within
every
discipline
and
every
sector
of
society
yet
our
ability
to
respond
to
the
well-documented
need
for
a
large
diverse
computationally
literate
workforce
remains
a
challenge
we
summarize
our
35
years
of
lessons
learned
for
preparing
the
workforce
that
can
inform
efforts
to
address
this
challenge
we
have
pursued
a
multiprong
approach
to
reach
instructors
researchers
professionals
and
students
on
a
national
scale
our
efforts
in
scaling
up
and
sustaining
activities
range
from
teaching
computational
thinking
through
imparting
hpc
skills
we
have
been
able
to
scale
up
these
activities
through
community
efforts
to
share
cooperate
and
collaborate
the
potential
for
providing
life-long
learning
to
everyone
wishing
to
expand
their
computational
knowledge
and
skills
is
greater
than
any
organization
can
achieve
on
its
own
cloud
adoption
in
industrial
sectors
such
as
process
manufacturing
health
care
and
finance
is
steadily
rising
but
as
it
grows
the
risk
of
targeted
cyberattacks
has
increased
hence
effectively
defending
against
such
attacks
necessitates
skilled
cybersecurity
professionals
traditional
human-based
cyber-physical
education
is
resource
intensive
and
faces
challenges
in
keeping
pace
with
rapidly
evolving
technologies
this
research
focuses
on
the
main
advantages
of
incorporating
large
language
models
into
cyber-physical
education
the
chatgpt
platform
serves
as
an
online
tool
to
educate
students
on
fundamentals
cyberattacks
and
defense
concepts
fostering
the
development
of
a
new
generation
cybersecurity
experts
the
proposed
learning
approach
adheres
to
the
chatgpt-assisted
learn–apply–create
model
responding
to
prompts
provided
by
the
learners
the
learning
phase
engages
in
conceptual
learning
the
applying
phase
involves
mathematical
modeling
of
various
cyberattacks
and
the
creating
phase
develops
matlab
program
to
incorporate
attacks
into
sensor
measurements
for
the
experiment
and
entails
developing
the
necessary
attack
detection
approaches
the
effectiveness
of
the
detection
method
developed
by
chatgpt
is
assessed
in
both
the
simulation
and
real-time
scenarios
using
a
j-type
thermocouple
the
impact
of
the
proposed
learning
platform
over
traditional
learning
methods
is
evaluated
through
an
extensive
comparative
feedback
analysis
on
the
learners
foundational
concepts
computational
thinking
programming
efficacy
and
motivation
the
study
proved
that
integrating
chatgpt
into
engineering
education
enables
students
to
swiftly
learn
cyber-physical
fundamentals
comprehend
and
model
cyberattacks
create
new
attack
signatures
and
contribute
to
developing
detection
algorithms
such
integration
provides
the
learners
with
essential
industrial
skills
crucial
in
modern
industries
the
emerging
information
technology
and
the
rising
computational

make
it
possible
to
establish
new
theoretical
methods
and

preliminarily
this
full

paper
focuses
on
the
design
of
a
teaching
practices
management
system
tpms
which
supports
the
sharing
of
teaching
practices
tps
amongst
computer
science
instructors
many
years
of
valuable
tps
can
be
lost
due
to
academic
retirement
when
no
competent
knowledge
management
system
is
available
for
recording
these
tps
consequently
novice
teachers
are
currently
facing
critical
challenges
when
delivering
subject
knowledge
that
relates
to
algorithms
programming
and
the
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
without
the
benefit
of
others
experience
after
a
study
of
the
relevant
literature
it
could
be
seen
that
far
too
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
capturing
and
sharing
of
tps
which
are
not
easily
expressed
or
communicated
in
visual
or
verbal
terms
thus
we
design
and
then
demonstrate
a
teaching
practices
management
system
tpms
which
supports
the
capturing
of
tps
a
quantitative
and
a
qualitative
evaluation
of
users
experiences
of
employing
the
system
shows
that
instructors
are
satisfied
with
it
and
are
mostly
positive
about
its
features
the
findings
of

we
introduce

we
share
the
underlying

principles
behind
octave
and
details
about
the
system
design
and
implementation
to
evaluate
octave
we
conducted
a
usability

the
results
show
that
non-programmer

were
able
to
learn
octave
easily
and
were
able
to
effectively
use
it
to
solve
domain-specific

and
felt
they
could

this

describes
the
mathematics
teacher
knowledge
transformation
when
computer

during
the
last

educators
made
a
significant

ct
in
k-12
while
this
effort
produced
some
positive
results
in
schools
where
resources
and
specialized
educators
are
available
there
are
school
districts
where
creating
new
classes
andor
hiring
specialized
teachers
is
not
a
sustainable
option
this
creates
a
need
for
teachers
that
are
specialized
in
one
subject
area
to
expand
their
knowledge
into
cs
and
ct
and
teach
these
concepts
in
their
classes
this
knowledge
expansion
and
integration
should
result
in
creating
integrated
curricula
using
their
subject
matter
knowledge
and
the
newly
acquired
cs
knowledge
this
implies
that
the
teacher
should
be
able
to
identify
the
intersection
of
concepts
between
the
two
fields
and
leverage
their
difference
and
similarities
to
promote
deep

ct
this

is
a
three-day
intervention
in
a
graduate

secondary
mathematics
education
methods
course
where
utilizing
math
cs
integrated
modules
we
infuse
cs
concepts
into
mathematics
the
already
known
mathematics
context
reduced
the
cognitive
load
for
familiarizing
the
teacher
candidates
with
cs
and
the
integration
of
the
cs
concepts
provided
a
different
perspective
for
thinking
about
mathematics
and
teaching
after
having
the
teacher
candidates
reflecting
on
the
concepts
of
variable
and

our
results
showed
that

developing
this

furthermore
the
study
showed
that
representing
multiplications
using
repetition
structures
illuminated
the
internal
mechanic
of
multiplication
and
its
properties
finally
the
experience
with
the
strict

illuminated
the

students
and
whether
their

highlighted
important
feedback
from
undergraduate
computer

students
which
provides
an
opportunity
to
apply
their

tries
to
find
out
the
learners
who
needs
help
by
grasping
the
learners’
development
of

using
tests
that
require
knowledge
however
in
reality
not
many
learners
will
acquire
the
skill
of
writing

this
kind
of
current
situation
implies
that
programming
ability
of

cannot
be
measured
by

this
paper
focuses
on
not
only
the
knowledge
items
required
for

but
also
the
programming
thinking
computational
thinking
which
is
the
ability
to
combine
the
constituent
elements
of
the
program
in
this
paper
we
propose
a
method
to
estimate
the
learner’s
understanding
from
the
learner’s
process
to
solve
the
code
puzzles
that
require
programming
thinking
as
well
as
knowledge
we
developed
the
interface
to
realize
the
proposed
method
the
experimental
result
with
the

showed
that
the
proposed
method
could
estimate

the
accuracy
of
80
or
more
the

these
opportunities
have
become
increasingly
present
across
contexts
and
have
expanded
the
possibilities
for
introducing
and
sustaining
student
participation
in

however
while
these

tend
to
be
effective
ways
for
engaging
new

we
must
be
careful
to
not
overlook
how

skills
to

address
the
lack

an
educational

research
edr
project
was
developed
to
introduce
young
students
to
stem
and
particularly
to
electronics
field
for
this
purpose
the
developed
approach
combines
instructionism
and
constructionism
methods
through
three
educational
projects
and
“drops

modules
the
developed
material
was
applied
to
9th

with
the
achieved
results
showing
that
this
immersive
approach
effectively
provides
students
with
the
necessary
competencies
to
tackle
the
initial
technological

the
project
was
recognized
by
the
directorate
general
of

of
portugal
as
a
recommended
practice
of
a
digital
initiative
within
secondary

in
this
research
to
practice
report
we
present
student
perceptions
of
a
new
first-year
engineering
programming
class
that
was
designed
by
informed
research
practices
while
the
college
of
engineering
at
the
participating
university
saw
a
lot
of
major
switching
in
the
first
year
there
were
not
many
students
switching
into
computer
science
cs
this
could
have
been
because
other
engineering
major
classes
did
not
transfer
well
to
cs
or
that
students
would
be
a
year
behind
in
the
programming
classes
in
either
case
the
participating
university
felt
that
computational
thinking
and
programming
were
an
important
part
of
first-year
engineering
exploration
and
believed
that
all
21st
century
engineering
majors
should
learn
to
program
in
a
general
purpose
language
such
as
python
or
c
past
research
found
that
prior
programming
experience
knowledge
organization
self-efficacy
and
class
size
were
factors
impacting
student
performance
in
early
programming
courses
and
learning
about
programming
enhanced
students
problem-solving
skills
and
improved
perceptions
about

many
other
research
studies
showed
that
the
context
in
which
programming
material
was
presented
to
non-majors
was
important
for
their
learning
and
interest
and
themed
mixed-context
courses
with
real-world
engineering
problems
worked
well
therefore
in
the
spring
2022
we
created
12
100-person
sections
of
a
course
titled
“engineering
computational
and
algorithmic_thinking”
for
a
new
first-year

experience
each
section
was
taught
by
a
different
instructor
representing
a
variety
of
disciplines

topics
in
the
college
of

this

describes
the
research

and
engineering
student
perceptions
of
the
new
required
programming
class
we
hypothesized
that
engineering
students
would
say
that
the
course
should
be
required
for
all
engineering
majors
but
we
wanted
to
know
why
we
believed
that
student
prior
programming
experience
engineering
major
and
other
demographics
would
play
a
role
in
their
responses
we
thematically
analyzed
student
justifications
to
identify
emerging
themes
and
we
used
a
mixed-method
approach
to
correlate
themes
to
different
student
demographics
engineering
major
interest
and
prior
programming
experience
the
majority
of
engineering
students
agreed
that
the
first-year
engineering
course
should
be
required
and
prior
programming
experience
and
major
played
the
largest
role

in

a
student’s
thought
process
can
lead
to
multiple

for
the
same
problem
however
current
programming
kt
models
attribute
learners’
responses
only
to

overlooking

factors
which
creates
a
contradiction
between

shoulders
the
mission
of
cultivating
computational

and
information
literacy
and
plays
an
important
basic
role
in
the
general

curriculum
system
of
undergraduate

how
to
put
computational

training
into
practice
in
teaching
strategy
design
is
problem
worth
researching
this
paper
gives
an
understanding
of
the
nature
status
and
role
of
the
course
firstly
on
this
basis
instructional
design
research
is
carried
out
from
the
aspects
of
objective
design
content
design
teaching
strategy
design
and
evaluation
design
etc
the
purpose
is
to
find
feasible
implementation
strategies
according
to
the
characteristics
and
training
objectives
of
the
course
so
as
to
realize
the
teaching
objectives
of
the
course
and
truly
implement
the
training
of
computational

computational
thinking
is
one
of
the
fundamental
skills
of
the
21st
century
and
will
be
a
necessary
part
of
all
future
work
so
it
is
essential
that
children
learn
it
in
school
one
way
to
work
on
computational
thinking
is
through
data
visualization
this
paper
presents
the
motivation
design
and
implementation
of
a
platform
called
alfadatizando
through
which
it
is
possible
to
work
with
data
visualization
activities
to
promote
the
skill
of
computational
thinking
in
digital
humanities
alfadatizando
allows
the
creation
resolution
and
feedback
of
data
visualization
activities
without
the
need
to
use
another
platform
it
also
allows
sharing
didactic
sequences
and
data
sources
with
the
educational
community
registered
in
the
platform
alfadatizando
is
still
in
an
early
stage
of

steam
education
and
computational

emphasize
interdisciplinary
integrated
learning
however
the
steam

scheme
designed
for
the
art
domain
is
limited
therefore
this
study
develops
an
interactive

the
goal
of
the

is
to
integrate

and
assessed
a
20-hour
professional
development
program
with
21
teachers
from
public
middle
and
high
schools
in
antioquia
colombia
the
program
introduced
the
concepts
and

of
ct
and
discussed
why
these
are
relevant
for

was
used
as
the
pedagogical
approach

scaffold
participants
learning
process
at
the
end
of
the
workshop
the
teachers
completed
a
survey
regarding
their
experience
in
the

preliminary
results
indicate
that
the
participating

increased
their
knowledge
and
interest
to
integrate
computational

the
computer
science
industry
suffers
from
a
significant
gender
gap
this
situation
likely
hinders
the
creation
of
inclusive
and
user-friendly
systems
due
to
a
bias
in
perspectives
to
narrow
this
gender
gap
this
study
investigates
how
females
program
to
increase
interest
in
computer
sciences
specifically
60
open
scratch
projects
on
the
web
are
analyzed
to
clarify
differences
in
the
computational
thinking
scores
with
respect
to
gender
the
difference
in
the
computational
thinking
score
by
gender
suggests
that
the
gap
may
be
due
to
the
lack
of
the
synchronization
element
in
female
users’
projects
a
deeper
understanding
of
how
people
program
based
on
gender
should
support
creating
an
effective

environment
and
allow
educators
to
create
programming
materials
that
attract
both
genders
equally
into
the

many
educational
resources
are
available

as
part
of
this
initiative
we
develop
computational
puzzles
from
well-known
computational

activities
inspired
by
the
idea
of
geocaching
we
made
our
puzzles
accessible
and
fun
for
the
whole

by
embedding
them
into
a

we
describe
our
approach

tools
much
of
the
research
to
date
has
been
concentrated
in
primary

secondary_education
with
a
shortfall
in

settings
this
research
aims
to
try
and
address
this
gap
and
is
comprised
of
three
main
stages
a
literature
review
a
pre-pilot
study
and
a
pilot
study
the
literature
review
identified
a
validated
tool
with
potential
for
use
with
undergraduate
computing
students
the
pre-pilot
and
pilot
studies
invited
participants
to
engage
with
the
tool
but
engagement
was
limited
with
low
participation
rates
this
paper
examines
the
reasons
for
this
and
explores
possible
ways
to
move
the
research
forward
considering
these
challenges
with
the
development
of
virtual
reality
technology
3d
virtual
robots
are
increasingly
used
in
primary_school
robot
programming
teaching
therefore
in
this
study
64
fifth-grade
students
were
divided
into
two
groups
and
the
experimental
research
method
was
used
to
investigate
which
method
is
more
conducive
to
improving
students’
learning
engagement
and
computational
thinking
by
combining
or
separately
using
3d
virtual
robots
and
physical
robots
in
robot
programming
courses
the
results
show
that
the
combined
use
of
3d
virtual
and
physical
robots
in
a
robot
programming
course
improves
students’
programming
self-efficacy_scale
and
learning
engagement
thus
improving
students’
computational
thinking
in
this
work
we
study
the
self-efficacy
of
the
use
of
the
choreographe
software
in
block_programming
using
the
nao
robot
in
order
to
develop
instructional
videos
in
the
classroom
within
the
framework
of
computational

the
put
forward
objectives
were
three
1
evaluate
the
level
of
significance
of
self-efficacy
and
the
applicability
of
ct
concepts
2
measure
the
relationship
between
the
applicability
of
ct
concepts
with
the
ease
of
use
usefulness
attitude
and
intention
to
work
in
the
future
with
an
instructional
program
3
establish
the
percentages
and
means
of
the
items
of
the
variables
concepts
ct
and
self-efficacy
thus
from
a
quantitative
approach
we
propose
to
create
a
questionnaire
to
measure
self-efficacy
and
the
level
of
knowledge
acquired
in
block_programming
4

highlighting
a
positive

which
is
one
of
the

this

computational

ct
has
been
described
as
a
set
of
valuable
skills
for
tackling
complex
problems
to
foster
ct
among
k-12
students
different
initiatives
have
been
introduced
by
governmental
and
non-governmental
entities
and
numerous
studies
have
been
carried
out
by
researchers
to
define
and
integrate
ct
into
school
curriculum
however
previous
studies
has
shown
little
agreement
among
researchers
governmental
and
non-governmental
sectors
about
a
unified
ct
definition
these
dissensions
have
introduced
challenges
in
formulating
a
definition
for
ct
at
the
k-12
level
the
absence
of
a
unified
definition
may
increase
the
challenges
for
teachers
to
teach
and
integrate
ct
into
school
curriculum
to
foster
ct
among
k-12
students
we
introduce
a
definition
and
framework
for
ct
we
evaluated
39
articles
and
extracted
the
most
common
elements
used
in
the
literature
to
frame
ct
definition
and
describe
its
elements
several
studies
have
discussed
as
well
as
investigated
the
significance
of
conceptualizing
and
comprehending
the
interaction
and
dependency
relationships
among
computational
objects
however
our
literature
review
discovered
that
little
attention
has
been
dedicated
to
the
concept
of
dependency
in
the
ct
body
of
knowledge
based
on
the
literature
review
we
define
ct
as
the
thought
process
used
for
solving
problems
and
it
encompasses
the
elements
of
problem
decomposition
abstraction
and
algorithmic_thinking
we
conjecture
the
ct
definition
is
missing
the
element
of
dependency
in
the
context
of
ct
we
define
dependency
as
the
knowledge
of
comprehending
the
interrelationships
between
different
sections
of
a
decomposed
problem
in
this
pilot
study
we
created
and
evaluated
a
new
version
of
the
techcheck
computational
thinking
ct
assessment
designed
specifically
for
kindergarten
students
the
original
version
of
techcheck
was
validated
in
first
and
second
graders
and
consists
of
15
multiple
choice
unplugged
challenges
drawn
from
six
ct
domains
the
kindergarten
version
called
techcheck-k
consists
of
similar
unplugged
challenges
but
reduces
the
number
of
response
choices
from
four
to
three
and
uses
exclusively
non-verbal
material
in
the
responses
to
accommodate
younger
pre-literate
children
we
administered
techcheck-k
to
n
89
kindergarten
students
from
four
schools
including
45
boys
and
44
girls
with
no

the

the

to
the

techcheck-k
items
correlated
r

with
the
pattern
observed
in

on
the
original
techcheck
providing
evidence
that
comparable
ct
constructs
are
measured
by
the
two

of
the

results
of
this
pilot

indicate
that
techcheck-k
has
acceptable
characteristics
for

educational

even
though
such
games
have
shown
some
success
in
promoting
ct
they
fall
short
when
it
comes
to
acquisition
of
ct

they
rather
promote
abstract

conceptual
knowledge
and
offering
adaptivity
to
each
player
to
address
these
issues
and
improve
the
existing
games
we
developed
an
adaptive

called
autothinking
for
teaching
both
ct
concepts

engaging
students
with

we
conducted
a

the
findings
showed
that
autothinking
is
making
children
feel
challenged
happy
and
confident
while
activating
their

process
during
the
gameplay
all

perceived
the

however
the
lack

made
it
a
big
challenge
for

while
our
overall

we
found
some

we
encountered
several
challenges
recruiting

and
found
that
computer

not
fall
into
the
stereotype
of
most
computer

was
higher
than

a
disconnect
appeared
between
the
pedagogical
practices
promoted
for
teaching

at
the
high_school
level
and
those
being
practiced
at
the
college
level
after
learning
about

in
the
potential
of
using
more
student-centered

instruction
but
also
for
their

an
area
of
disconnect
also
emerged
in
the

as
an
example
to
study
the

this
is
particularly
important
in
stem
disciplines
where
logical

is
essential
for
addressing
complex
real-world

the
approach
involved
designing

further
and
distribute
them
to
a
broader
range
of
introductory-level

this
future
direction
aligns
with
the
goal
of
expanding
the

intended
to
improve
the
computational

ct
the
main
instructional
tool
for
this
course
is
the
beam
robot
a
robotics
paradigm
that
proposes
simple
robots
whose
behavior
can
be
controlled
without
software
programming
the
programming
of
this
robot
is
implicit
in
its
morphology
so
its
actions
and
goals
are
codified
from
its
construction
a
three-phase
curriculum
is
designed
to
achieve
the
objective
propaedeutic
robot
assembly
and
ct
on
the
basis
of
these
phases
the
course
is
constructed
modularly
and
implemented
virtually
while
students
receive
construction
kits
each
phase
aims
to
foster
the
many
facets
of

such
as
decomposition
abstraction
algorithm
debugging
iteration
and

students’
responses
to
pre-and
post-course
surveys
as

the
development
of
computer

has
led
to
an
increase
in

for
younger
people
many
countries
have
begun
programming

students’
ct
growth
in
their
first
3
years
of

a
preliminary
result
shows
that
ct
grows
rapidly
in
the
first
2
years
and
tends
to
be
stable
in
the
third

the
reasons
for
the

aimed
to
assess
if
the

11
years
old
for
this
purpose
a
quasi-experiment
with
52
children
of
two

was
performed
the
obtained

this
highlights
the
fact
that

the
disappointing
results
that
brazilian

been
showing
in
external

cause
us
concern
technologies

it
is
therefore
necessary
in
some
way
to
change
this
paradigm
with
regard
to
the
role
that
the
teacher
plays
from
consumer
to
producer
of
technological

and
trying
to
contribute
to
this
extremely
complex
scenery
this
paper
intends
to
show
how
a
proposal
launched
in

education
combined
aspects
of
gamification
and
computational

aiming
to
bring
another
look
at

increase
the

as
a
proposal
a
suggestion
of
gamified
activity
in
the
style
of
a
game
known
as
“escape

was
presented
using
the
google

tool
we
note
that
insecurity
with
technological
tools
or
lack
of
knowledge
about
some
features
of
these
same
tools
is
still
a
factor
that
causes
many
concerns
among
teachers
we
concluded
that
reflection
on
ourpractice
is
fundamental
and
in
a
way
we
realize
that
we
have
managed
to
broaden
our
horizons
about
the
use
of
certain
technological
tools
in
this
paper
we
summarize
results
of
our
internet

which
took
place
in

2021
having
over
3400

of
the
danger
of
this

are
clear
and
demonstrable
a
significant

of
the
teenagers
came
across
with
it
the
linkage
and
necessity
of
awareness
in
terms
of
secure
behaviour
on
the
internet
and
relevance
with
computational

is
obvious
but
out
of
scope
of
this
work
this
systematic
review
aims
to
explore
how
students
cs
learning
experience
influences
their
perception
of

we
identified
21

paper
discusses
a
next-generation
learning
system
for
k-12
students
to
educate
them
on
scientific
concepts
surrounding
the
human

specifically
our
gamified
learning
system
is
designed
to
make
learning
more
fun
engaging
and
effective
through
game
and
experiment
elements
that
align
with
science
and
math
learning
standards
it
will
also
increase
systematic
problem-solving
and
algorithmic
reasoning
for
k-12
students
since
the
human
body
can
be
thought
of
as
a
combination
of
interacting
systems
the
game
also
introduces
students
to
computational
thinking
by
introducing
internal
body
functions
to
achieve
these
goals
this
project
has
two
components
first
an
educational
virtual
reality
game
will
be
built
according
to
the
natural
human
body
structure
during
the
game
process
students
will
experience
the
same
as
the
human
body
functions
travel
along
the
blood
circulation
help
with
the
heartbeat
and
participate
in
oxygen
exchange
while
students
are
playing
the
game
our
gamified
adaptive
learning
system
tracks
and
controls
the
students
learning
progress
as
the
ai
component
collects
student
data
and
uses
this
information
our
system
adjusts
game
content
and
addresses
possible
learner
issues
to
refine
the
learning
curriculum
for
a
faster
and
more
effective
learning
experience
second
a
series
of
hands-on
activities
will
be
conducted
based
on
the
functions
of
the
human
body
eg
developing
an
artificial
heart
and
experiencing
how
the
heart
works
through
this
project
an
attractive
and
efficient
next-generation
learning
system
will
be
developed
and
used
to
expose
k-12
students
to
this
learning
system
the
education
of
students
will
be
accomplished
in
different
dimensions
through
games
and
hands-on
practice
respectively
additionally
compared
to
traditional
learning
methods
our
learning
system
not
only
increases
students
interest
in
learning
but
also
makes
it
more
personalized
compared
to
the
conventional
learning
process
likewise
we
will
refer
to
the
results
of
self-efficacy
surveys
administered
to
students
and
teachers
separately
to
test
their
perceptions
of
their
abilities
and
the
new

blockpy
is
a
block-based
program
language
which
has
both
block-based
interface
and
traditional
text-based
interface
it
fills
the
gap
between
block-based
programming
and
language
coding
but
there
is
little
work
that
focuses
on
the
computational
thinkingct
evaluation
of
blockpy
programs
in
this
paper
we
design
and
implement
a
blockpy
analysis
tool
to
assess
the
ct
skills
of
blockpy
programs
automatically
we
use
pythons
built-in
ast
module
to
analyse
each
node
in
the
abstract
syntax
treeast
of
each
blockpy
program
then
considering
the
characteristics
of
python
language
we
propose
a
new
ct
evaluation
criteria
based
on
scratch
analysis
toolsat
under
the
guidance
of
the
ct
evaluation
criteria
we
propose
a
detailed
scoring
program
to
analyze
each

of
the
program
and
get
the
ct

show
the
superiority
of

that
‘computing’
has
become
an
indispensable
tool
for

the

is
of
great
significance
to
medical

however
medical

are
lack
of
this
strategy
in

meanwhile
there
is
also
a
problem
of
‘insufficient
skills
and
no
training’
in
computer

in
this
article
we
recommend
training
students’
computational
thinking
from
three
aspects
first
students
can
learn
the
basic
concepts
of
computational

and
different
thinking
modes
of
computer
scientists
through
computer
courses
in
both
theory
and

to
train
their
computational

second
in
the
process
of

directly
carry
out
divergent
thinking
logical
integration
and
practice
the

methods
of
scientists
such
as

the

this

for

entering

efforts
to
broaden

in

have
revealed
the
need
for
a
deeper
theoretical
and
empirical
understanding
of
how
girls
of
color
form
computing
identities
in
this
paper
we
use
the
concept
of
identities-in-practice
as
an
analytical
frame
to
examine
how
girls
of
color
engage
in
computational

practices
our
research
investigates
how
the
identities
of

can
be
leveraged
as
funds
of

in

spaces
and
asks
the
following
research
question
how
does
centering
the
identities
of
girls
of

impact
their
engagement
with

we
provide
a

and
share
results
from
pilot
implementations
of
the
program
offered
at
public

in
michigan
arizona
and
california
results
from
our
pilot
year
demonstrate
that
integrating
identity
exploration
into
a
computational
thinking
curriculum
results
in
a
mutually
reinforcing
relationship
where
girls
of
color
experience
reflective
identity
development
while
simultaneously
increasing
their
understanding
of
computational
thinking
we
present
our
approach
as
a
promising
avenue
for
connecting
computing
knowledge
and
skills
to
girls
identities
and
lived
experiences
by
focusing
on
the
girls
identities
the
program
re-imagines
computational
experiences
by
fostering
interactions
with
computational
thinking
from
a
personal
perspective
ultimately
we
argue
that
centering
girls
identities
should
be
viewed
as
an
integral
part
of
the
learning
process
and
not
tangential
educational
robotics

through
the
teaching

way
in

and
high_school
the
most
ct
skills
observed
are
related
to
programming
such
as
sequencing
algorithm
loop
generalization
decomposition
and
debugging
the
main
instruments
for
assessing
students
are
tests
and
the
most
significant
difficulty
is
the
limitation
of

hours
finally
lego®
is
the
most
used
technology
in
class
given
the
pervasive
reliance
on
technology
in
modern
society
teaching
computational
thinking
ct
abilities
is
becoming
increasingly
relevant
these
abilities
such
as
modeling
and
coding
have
become
crucial
for
a
larger
audience
of
students
not
only
those
who
wish
to
become
software
engineers
or
computer
scientists
recent
advances
in
large
language
models
llms
such
as
chatgpt
provide
powerful
assistance
to
complete
computational
tasks
by
simplifying
code
generation
and
debugging
and
potentially
enhancing
interactive
learning
however
it
is
not
clear
if
these
advances
make
ct
tasks
more
accessible
and
inclusive
for
all
students
or
if
they
further
contribute
to
a
digital
skills
divide
favoring
the
top
students
to
address
this
gap
we
have
created
and
evaluated
a
novel
learning
scenario
for
transversal
ct
skills
that
leveraged
llms
as
assistants
we
conducted
an
exploratory
field
study
during
the
spring
semester
of
2022
to
assess
the
effectiveness
and
user
experience
of
llm-augmented
learning
our
results
indicate
that
the
usage
of
chatgpt
as
a
learning
assistant
improves
learning
outcomes
furthermore
contrary
to
our
predictions
the
usage
of
chatgpt
by
students
does
not
depend
on
prior
ct
capabilities
and
as
such
does
not
seem
to
exacerbate
prior
inequalities
todays
digital
society
has
turned
the
development
of
students
computational
thinking
capabilities
into
a
critical
factor
for
their
future
success
as
higher_education
institutions
we
need
to
take
responsibility
for
this
development
in
every
degree
course
we
offer
and
provide
students
with
the
kind
of
subjects
and
activities
that
best
contribute
to
this
aim
in
this
paper
we
study
the
impact
of
following
an
introductory
programming
course
on
the
development
of
the
computational
thinking
capabilities
of
university
students
in
order
to
achieve
this
aim
a
concurrent
cohort
observational
study
was
carried
out
in
which
we
measured
both
the
subjective
and
objective
computational
thinking
capabilities
of
104
participants
50
first
year
students
enrolled
on
a
bachelors
degree
course
in
psychology
at
the
catholic
university
of
murcia
ucam
and
54
first
year
students
enrolled
on
a
bachelors
degree
course
in
health
information
systems
at
the
university
of
alicante
ua
the
statistical
procedures
applied
to
test
our
hypotheses
were
a
two-way
mixed
anova
a
paired-sample
t-test
and
an
independent-sample
t-test
the
data
shows
that
the
group
at
ua
had
an
initial
higher
subjective
perception
of
their
computational
capabilities
than
the
group
at
ucam
this
perception
was
supported
by
their
objective
scores
which
were
also
significantly
higher
however
the
subjective
assessment
of
computational
capability
of
the
ua
group
diminished
after
exposure
to
the
programming
course
contrasting
with
the
fact
that
their
objective
computational
capabilities
improved
significantly
in
the
ucam
group
both
subjective
and
objective
capabilities
remained
constant
over
time
based
on
these
results
we
can
conclude
that
computational
thinking
capabilities
are
not
developed
naturally
but
need
to
be
trained
providing
such
training
to
all
our
students
and
not
only
to
those
enrolled
on
undergraduate
degrees
in
engineering
is
of
paramount
importance
to
allow
them
to
face
the
challenges
of
their
future
professions
this
paper
empirically
demonstrates
the
extent
to
which
exposing
subjects
to
a
programming
course
may
contribute
to
this
aim
chatgpt
has
received
considerable
attention
in
education
particularly
in
programming
education
because
of
its
capabilities
in
automated
code
generation
and
program
repairing
and
scoring
however
few
empirical
studies
have
investigated
the
use
of
chatgpt
to
customize
a
learning
system
for
scaffolding
students’
computational
thinking
therefore
this
article
proposes
an
intelligent
programming
scaffolding
system
using
chatgpt
following
the
theoretical
framework
of
computational
thinking
and
scaffolding
a
mixed-method
study
was
conducted
to
investigate
the
affordance
of
the
scaffolding
system
using
chatgpt
and
the
findings
show
that
most
students
had
positive
attitudes
about
the
proposed
system
and
it
was
effective
in
improving
their
computational
thinking
generally
but
not
their
problem-solving
skills
therefore
more
scaffolding
strategies
are
discussed
with
the
aim
of
improving
student
computational
thinking
especially
regarding
problem-solving
skills
the
findings
of
this
study
are
expected
to
guide
future
designs
of
generative
artificial
intelligence
tools
embedded
in
intelligent
learning
systems
to
foster
students’
computational
thinking
and
programming
learning
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
look
at
how
a
music
programming
course
affects
the
development
of
computational
thinking
in
undergraduate
music
conservatory
students
in
addition
to
teaching
the
fundamentals
of
computational
thinking
music
programming
and

the
course
addresses
the
four
c’s
of

the
change
in
students’
attitudes
toward
computer
and
algorithmic
skills
creativity
communication
and
collaboration
is
measured
using
a
pre-

post-test
experimental
design
additionally
computational
thinking
abilities
are
assessed
through
the
administration
of
music
analysis
procedural
graphical
and
logic
quizzes
while
creativity
is
evaluated
through
a
qualitative
grading
of
the
students’
final
music
projects
results
show
a
general
perceived
improvement
of
the
students’
attitudes
toward
the
four
c’s
as
well
as
a
good
ability
to
convert
learned
computational
models
into
musical
creativity
however
more
effort
is
needed
in
order
to
guarantee
an
overall
improvement
in
the
students’
actual
computational

has
been
widely
regarded
as
an
important
ability

the
results
show
that
it
helps
to
stimulate
students
desire
to
learn
thereby
significantly
improving
academic
performance
and
learning
motivation
at
the
same
time
it
makes
students

self-confidence
and
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
makes
learners
aware
of
the
inadequacy
of
self-learning
and
promotes
their
willingness
to
learn
from
passive
to
active
computational
thinking
is
a
high-level
skill
that
involves
both
critical
and
creative
thinking
this

in
this
paper
we
propose
using
computational

to
help
the
understanding
of
proportional

has
been
prepared
in
which
they
exercise
the
concepts
of
proportional

the
approach
followed
has
consisted
of
developing
a

that

for

although
computer
science
has
grown
to
become
one
of
the
most
highly
demanded
professional
careers
every
year
only
a
small
percentage
of
students
choose
a
degree
directly
related
to
computer
science
perhaps
the
problem
lies
in
the
lack
of
information
that
society
has
about
computer
science
itself
and
particularly
about
the
work
computer
scientists
do
no
one
doubts
the
role
of
mathematics
or
languages
as
core
subjects
in
every
primary
and
secondary_education
syllabus
however
computer
science
plays
a
negligible
role
in
most
current
syllabuses
only
in
a
few
countries
have
governments
paid
special
attention
to
content
related
to
computer
science
and
to
learning
to
analyze
and
solve

the
way
computer

do
computational

we
present

a
project
that
provides
a
methodology
to
promote
computer

through
computational

activities
among
primary

students
the
results
obtained
from
an
exhaustive
statistical
analysis
of
the

we
collected
demonstrate
that
the
perception
of
computer
science
that
pre-university
students
have
can
be
improved
through
specific
training
moreover
we
can
also
confirm
that
the
performance
of
pre-university
students
involving
computational
thinking
skills
is
independent
of
gender
particularly
at
the

deals
with
the
difficulty
that
it
is
possible
to
teach
computational

through
the
teaching
of

we
propose
approaches
to
teach

knowing
that
it
is
a
difficult
task
for
many

also
has
its
difficulties
the
brazilian
computer
society
sbc
understands
that
it
is
fundamental
and
strategic
for
brazil
that
computer

students
have
been
analyzed
from
different
approaches
one
of
them
is
the
computational

where
most
of

is
developed
with
the
well-oriented
activities
realized
by

in
many
of
the

are
fundamental
and
because
of
the

they
have
not
been
seen
as
a
subject
where
students
can
develop
the
computational

process
present
work
describes
an
empirical
study
based
on
the
learning
of
the
rigid

with
the
use
of

as
an

students
identified
where
the

can
be
applied
in
their

post-test
it
was
focused
on
the
main

session
1
started
with
the
introduction
of
electronic
spreadsheets
for
their
use
in
science
and
engineering
some
examples
in
physics
and
mathematics
were
described
with
their

equations
plotting
of
the
results
and
the

were
described
for
reinforcing
the

learned
students
were
asked
to
solve
two
more
similar
exercises
with
the
use
of
the
spreadsheets
as
homework
and
finally
they
were
asked
to
record
in
groups
of
three
students
a
video
with
the
solution
of
the

assigned
in
the

needed
to
perform
the

with
its
graphical
representation
and
interpretation
of

and
a
description
of

model
at
the
end
of
the
sequence
in
session
three
a
virtual
simulation
related
to
their
professional

was
used
for
the
reinforcement
of
all
the

learned
for
analyzing
the
impact
in
their

process
the
normalized

was
used
in
the
pre-test
and
post-test
results
showed
a
g
085
which
represents
a
high

and
normalized
conceptual

finally
the
results
showed
that
the
computational
thinking
process
can
be
developed
by
students
as
they
must
program
equations
analyze
data
understand
it
and
identify
graphically
the
variables
involved
linking
the
learning
of
a
physical
concept
with
a
computational
tool
that
let
them
understand
in
a
more
clear
specific
and
ordered
thinking
the
solution
of
a
typical
programming
task
involves
algorithmic_thinking
pattern
recognition
decomposition
and
abstraction
skills
these
skills
are
basic
pillars
of
computational
thinking
ct
and
are
essential
for
a
computer
programmer
therefore
a
programming
teacher
needs
to
take
these
skills
into
account
for
the
evaluation
of
students
existing
methods
for
improving
programming
competency
don’t
consider
the
computational
thinking
of
students
and
perform
grading
of
students
without
taking
these
skills
into
account
due
to
this
limitation
deficiencies
of
these
skills
in
students
remain
unrevealed
posing
difficulties
for
educators
to
provide
need-oriented
feedback
the
performance
of
programming
students
is
thus
hindered
by
a
lack
of
interventions
this
study
proposes
a
method
to
evaluate
programming
students
in
terms
of
ct
skill
components
and
group
them
based
on
their
skill
set
in
this
study
780
students
of
object-oriented
programming
oop
class
were
given
programming
assignments
for
assessment
of
programming
competencies
these
students
were
then
given
small
programming
tasks
requiring
different
computational
thinking
skill
components
for
their
solutions
a
machine
learning
approach
was
used
to
perform
grouping
of
these
students
based
on
their
scores
six
groups
of
programming
students
each
having
its
own
set
of
skill
deficiencies
were
identified
as
a
result
of
clustering
one
of
the
groups
had
an
empty
set
of
skill
deficiencies
and
consisted
of
students
proficient
in
programming
each
of
the
other
five
groups
had
a
non-empty
set
of
skill
deficiencies
and
comprised
non-proficient
programming
students
a
group-specific
skill
development
plan
was
built
for
the
groups
having
skill
deficiencies
it
was
found
that
such
feedback
was
very
effective
and
improved
the
ct
skill

of
82
of
students
computational

is
one
barrier
to
enculturating

we
created
the

diagnostic
ectd
as
an
instructional
tool
that
can
identify
at-risk

is
to
provide

evidence
for
this
diagnostic
from
fall
2020
to
fall
2021
469
students
from
three
institutions
in
the
united
states
took
the
diagnostic
the
data
from
152
students
at
one
institution
was
used
to
provide
evidence
of
predictive
validity
exploratory
and
confirmatory

analyses
resulted
in
20

from
item
analyses
based
on

the
diagnostic
items
on
average
tended
to
be
slightly
easy
but
had
sufficient
discrimination
power
the
correlation
matrix
for
criterion

evidence
indicated
that
the
diagnostic
functions
well
to
differentiate
students’
computational

ability
by
prior
computer

course
experience
as
well
as
by
first-generation

evidence
from

analyses
revealed
the
statistically
significant
effect
of
students’
diagnostic
scores
assessed
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
semester
on
predicting
their
end
of

the
ectd
can
have
a
broad
impact
because
it
provides
a
tool
to
gauge
the
entry-level
skills
of
students
enabling
early
curriculum
interventions
to
help
retention
and
persistence
to
graduation
we
make
the
case
that
the
ectd
could
contribute
to
the
development
of
a
more
diverse
workforce
in
engineering
based
on
the
analysis
of
some
famous
instructional
cases
in
programming
education
and
in-depth
interviews
with
primary_school
teachers
who
are
engaged
in

this
paper
focuses
on
the
instructional
procedure
and
strategies
of

for
cultivating

this
examination
reveals

the
article
founds
that
the
instructional
procedure
of
cultivating
computational
thinking
in
programming
education
generally
involves
five
major
stages
knowledge
review
new
knowledge
exploration

and
the
stage
of

concludes
with
the
problems
that
appeared
in

especially
in
the
stage
of
new

and
pair-programming
we
conducted
a
systematic
review
of
studies
aimed
at
exploring
the
state
of
parental
involvement
in
computational
thinking
ct
education
to
facilitate
students’
efficiency
in
learning
computational
thinking
in
this
review
we
started
with
reviewing
theories
of
parental
involvement
then
we
investigated
and
categorized
types
of
parental
involvement
parent
roles
and
parents’
psychological
factors
in
the
parenting
process
we
also
supplemented
a
new
involvement
form
in
level
2
of
hoover-dempsey
and
sandler’s
model
of
parental
involvement
in
ct
education
namely
parents’
support
with
concerns
about
using
technology
and
ct
tools
we
proposed
the
model
of
parental
involvement
in
computational
thinking
education
we
conducted
comprehensive
research
of
related
studies
on
parental
involvement
in
ct
education
and
identified
the
research
gap
in
involving
parents
in
children’s
ct
learning
computational
thinking
is
considered
an
important
skill
set
for
21st-century
learners
and
became
a
subject
of
focus
in
k-12
education
in
recent
years
it
cultivates
problem-solving
and
algorithmic_thinking
and
can
be
helpful
in
wider
aspects
of
everyday
life
besides
programming
and
computer
science
in
this
paper
we
investigated
what
is
the
greek
primary
and
secondary_school
teachers’
understanding
and
awareness
as
far
as
computational
thinking
is
concerned
since
teachers
are
the
agents
of
change
it
is
critical
to
find
out
how
familiar
andor
skilled
they
are
with
the
computational
thinking
notion
thus
we
applied
a
qualitative
questionnaire
all
over
the
whole
greek
state
where
406
teachers
answered
the
study
led
to
a
number
of
interesting
conclusions
regarding
the
teacher’s
readiness
as
well
as
more
generic
aspects
according
to
their
profile
and
faculty
computational
thinking
ct
is
considered
as
the
skill
of
21st
century
the
fundamental
ct
concepts
include
abstraction
algorithm
design
decomposition
pattern
recognition
and
data
representation
or
generalization
ct
assessment
is
required
to
improve
the
understanding
of
the
cognitive
abilities
and
to
relate
them
in
related
areas
such
as
introductory
programming
in
computer
science
assessing
computational
thinking
skills
however
is
a
challenging
issue
since
it
measures
latent
variables
that
cannot
be
directly
observed
in
addition
according
to
psychometrics
appropriate
test
requires
a
validation
process
before
it
can
be
effectively
used
as
a
measuring
instrument
thus
high
quality
tools
for
measuring
student
learning
in
introductory
programming
have
been
under-developed
and
under-researched
the
objective
of
this
work
is
to
determine
the
psychometric
properties
item
validity
reliability
discrimination
difficulty
and
distractors
of
the
developed
multiple-choice
questions
of
computational
thinking
in
introductory
programming
by
exploring
classical_test_theory
and
item_response_theory
which
has
not
been
deeply
investigated
by
previous
studies
the
analysis
results
reveal
that
most
of
items
are
valid
and
the
items
are
generally
adequate
reliable
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
some
items
are
suggested
to
be
revised
since
the
item
discrimination
values
the
distribution
of
difficulties
and
distractor
points
are
less
than
the
expected
threshold
in
the
last
two
decades
computational
thinking
has
been
integrated
into
teaching
of
engineering
and
computer
science
majors
and
other
science
and
engineering
disciplines
in
universities
computational

plays
a
potential
role
in
cultivating

ability
to
use

to
solve
problems
to
extend
the
application
of
computational
thinking
in
disciplines
that
are
not
necessarily
related
to

and
engineering
this
study
proposes
a
new
theoretical
framework
and
curriculum
design
to
promote
the
infusion
of
ct
in
the
accounting
curriculum
sorting
is
an
algorithmic
concept
that
is
covered
in
every
fundamental
computer
science
and
engineering
course
and
included
in
most
if
not
all
programming
competitions
it
is
an
everyday
task
self-taught
and
done
naturally
even
by
a
small
child
in
spite
of
its
ingenuousness
mastering
sorting
algorithms
turns
out
to
be
not
so
simple
for
many
first-time
programmers
this
happens
because
how
humans
perform
sorting
is
far
from
being
straightforwardly
aligned
with
machine
instructions
we
have
developed
an
unplugged
game-based_learning
activity
that
aims
not
only
to
tackle
this
difficult
dilemma
but
also
to
promote
computational
thinking
practice
our
game
robustly
challenges
audiences
to
complete
a
fun
sorting
task
algorithmically
and
the
building
blocks
of
the
exercise
are
methodologically
grounded
in
the
four
cornerstones
of
computational
thinking
participants
are
gently
guided
through
solving
a
problem
by
decomposing
it
recognizing
patterns
applying
abstraction
writing
step-by-step
instructions
and
finally
arriving
at
a
programmable
solution
our
design
is
largely
flexible
the
game
can
be
played
in
small
groups
or
larger
ones
it
uses
only
common
readily
accessible
materials
and
is
easily
adaptable
to
different
levels
of
audiences
from
the
interested
general
public
to
secondary_school
students
and
teachers
to
non-computer
science
undergraduates
and
those
majoring
in
engineering
or
information
technology
related
subjects
we
have
implemented
this
activity
in
our
classrooms
and
conducted
several
workshops
responses
were
markedly
positive
engaged
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
participants
enjoyed
the
activity
having
fun
sorting

the
ideas
audiences
were
captivated
by
many
surprising
challenges
most
notably
they
were
able
to
comprehend
the
concepts
of
sorting
algorithms
and
the
computational
steps
behind
them
and
gain
a
better
understanding
of
computational

based
on
the

this
study
developed
an
interdisciplinary

using
three-dimensional
immersive
virtual

to
examine
its
effects
on

a
total
of
98
seventh-grade
students
participated
in
an
8-week
controlled
experiment
with
one

the
experimental
group
n49
used
the
virtual

platform
while
the
control

n49
created
projects
using
traditional

documents
the
results
indicate
that
virtual

technology
positively
influences
students
creativity
and
computational
thinking
however
no
statistically
significant
differences
were
observed
in
the
sub-dimensions
of

the
findings
suggest
that

a
during
the
last
two
decades
educational
robotics
became
a
popular
tool
for
teaching

yet
its
use
for

has
not
been
researched
so
far
this
work
presents
a
new
educational

the
key
aspect
is
a
separation
of
teaching

ct
is
the
focus
of
ongoing
debate
about
the
future
of
computing
in

and
this
poses
a
number
of
challenges
early
discussions
on
the
topic
were
plagued
by
vague
and
all-encompassing
definitions
of
the
term
which
raised
awareness
of
a
need
for
school
learning
focused
on
emerging
computational
systems
and
their
impact
on
society
and
the
lives
of
citizens
but
failed
to
address
what
should
actually
be
included
in
the
revised
curricula
as
some
of
those
issues
have
been
addressed
a
number
of
problems
remain
this
paper
analyses
some
recent
and
future
developments
in
the
field
of
computing
and
expands
the
discussion
on
the
vexed
question
of
the
nature
and
limits
of
computational
thinking
we
ask
whether
the
current
mainstream
literature
and
curriculum
for
ct
is
well
positioned
in
terms
of
the
future
towards
which
computing
is
heading
we
conclude
by
summarising
the
implications
these
questions
have
for
the
future
development
of
k-12
curricula
and
teaching
practices
central
to
the
theory
of

this
is
one
of
the
first

149
students
including
detailed

we
find
that

that
can
be
indexed
along
a
continuum
ranging
from
open

that
those
who
received

with
the
contribution
of

here
related
to

to
computational

presented
as
an
open-ended

which
involves
solving
a

and
appealing
to

we
target
problem-solving
tasks
using
tangible
interfaces
for
computational

initiation
and
describe
in
details
how
we
model
the
task
and
the
learner
behavior
in
this
task
including
goal-driven
versus
stimulus-driven
behavior
and
the

construction
we
show
how
formalizing
these

this
operationalization
of

is
still
at

an
effective
proof
of

is
described
in

digital
games
are
increasingly
a
part
of
our
daily
lives
and
are
already
considered
teaching
and
learning
tools
however
its
production
and
documentation
is
a
very
complicated
task
that
requires
programming
skills
and
knowledge
from
different
areas
this
has
hampered
the
development
of
games
in
the
classroom
environment
on
the
other
hand
some
teachers
have
proposed
this
activity
to
enable
their
students
to
learn
school
content
in
a
more
meaningful
way
and
consequently
improve
learning
rates
an
alternative
for
the
adoption
of
game-based_learning
is
an
unplugged
approach
for
creating
games
based
on
natural
language
in
which
students
learn
the
fundamentals
of
computing
in
a
playful
way
and
without
the
use
of
computers
in
this
context
this
article
presents
an
approach
that
proposes
the
creation
of
games
in
an
unplugged
way
by
using
texts
produced
by
students
thus
favoring
the
development
of
computational
thinking
and
reading
and
writing
skills
in
the
classroom
also
it
may
support
the
students
interest
in
the
computing
area
by
motivating
them
to
enter
a
higher_education
course
or
pursue
a
career
in
that
area
the
results
of
the
exploratory
study
show
that
the
proposed
approach
can
favor
the
development
of
computational
thinking
as
well
as
motivate
the
production
of
texts
developing
students
reading
and
writing
skills
therefore
contributing
to
the
improvement
of
learning
assessments
computational
thinking
is
a
competence
that
is
developed
more
in
the

few
years
this
is
due

of
activities
that
promote
the
development
of
computational

that
allow
visual

the
particularity
of
these
activities
is
that
some
of
them
were
performed
during
the
confinement
due
to
the

were
performed
later
in

there
is
a

drawing
on
a
process
of
decontextualisation
of

approach
to
evaluating
the
engagement
potential
of
the
instructional

as
well
as
the
didactic
choices
made
during

we
conclude
that
bebras

provide
considerable
support
for
a
playful
engagement
with

additionally
we
find
that

aimed
at
reducing
the

this
will
help
smoothly
transition

into
programming-relevant
modules
and
ultimately
enhance
the
effectiveness
of

this
study
originates
from
the
content
synthesis
of
studies
on
computational
thinking
need
assessment
gamification
and
computational
thinking
with
coding
from
thai
and
international
scholarly
articles
published
in
accredited

then
the
synthesis
results
were
integrated
into
the
development
of
computational
thinking
through
gamification
and
programming
knowledge
to
improve
the
efficacy
of
computational
learning
the
process
commenced
with
an
analysis
of
the
learners
needs
obtained
through
the
questionnaires
concerning
computational

data
analysis
illuminated
the
learners
levels
of
computational
thinking
as
well
as
a
fundamental
understanding
of
what
the
learners
need
to
be
taught
or
what
areas
of
skills
each
learner
with
regards
to
this
conventional
teaching
approaches
may
not
serve
best
to
transmit
the
relevant
knowledge
which
may
subsequently
induce
unfavorable
attitudes
toward
computational
thinking
with
the
data
elicited
through
the
need
assessment
instructors
will
have
a
clear
direction
as
to
how
the
pedagogical
process
should
be
designed
to
directly
address
the
needs
in
each
of
the
computational
thinking
components
in
general
each
component
of
them
is
rather
complex
so
the
researcher
incorporated
gamification
theory-based
learning
defined
by
its
enjoyable
game
mechanisms
and
challenging
nature
which
makes
the
coding
lesson
fun
with
block_programming
enabling
learners
to
proficiently
grasp
the
concept
of
computational
thinking
emotions
are
essential
drivers
of
the
learning
process
influencing
motivation
performance
and
problem-solving
abilities
in
the
field
of
computer
science
students
often
struggle
with
negative
emotions
during
programming
activities
impacting
their
performance
and
project
quality
to
address
this
challenge
there
is
a
growing
need
to
introduce
computational

skills
at
the
pre-university
level
this
study
focuses
on
understanding
the
emotions
experienced
by
primary
and
secondary_school
students
during
computational
thinking
activities
involving
both
plugged
and
unplugged
tools
a
significant
performance
difference
was
observed
between
primary
and
secondary_education
levels
with
the
latter
outperforming
the
former
the
research
identifies
specific
associations
between
concepts
and
emotions
highlighting
age-related
differences
with
younger
students
exhibiting
more
positive
emotions
while
gender-based
disparities
in
computer
science
perception
exist
in
secondary_education
there
are
no
corresponding
distinctions
in
emotional
responses
the
study
reveals
a
gender-based
effect
with
girls
showing
reduced
emotional
responses
and
lower
computational
thinking
performance
than
boys
in
summary
this
research
underscores
the
profound
role
of
emotions
in
learning
providing
essential
insights
for
tailoring
educational
strategies
considering
gender-specific
and
programming
concept-related
factors
it
also
connects
lower
emotional
reactions
to
inferior
results
emphasizing
the
importance
of
heightened
emotional
engagement
computational

the

among
them
learning

important
skills
which
are

such
as

therefore
computer

or
information

courses
often
limit
the
discussion
of
recursion
to
calculating
a
factorial
or
a

number
even
though
recursion
is
presented
as
an
academic-type
oddity
in
most
cases

to
elucidate
how
vr
can
improve
students’
computational
thinking
skills
and
abstract
thinking
associated
with
solving
problems
that
require
recursive
algorithms
this
paper
examines
the
use
of
vr
in
computer
science
education
to
teach
the
abstract
concept
of
recursion
the
results
of
learners
using
vr
tower
of
hanoi
software
are
compared
to
those
using
the
conventional
hanoi
puzzle
most
learners
show
an
improved
understanding
after
experiencing
the
gameplay
in
the
vr
software
and
some
demonstrate
a
better
understanding
of

in
the

most

acknowledge
that
the
immersive

is
helpful
when

student
dropout
rate
in
computer

is
the
highest
among

educators
are
striving
to
find
a
way
to
teach
efficiently
and
effectively
the
technical
and
the
problem_solving
skills
students
need
in
this
paper
we
will
be
studying
the
effects
of
syntax
exercises
on
a
subjects
ability
to
think
computationally
and
precisely
we
tested
our
process
on
professionals
and
students
half
of
the
professionals
were
in
the
computer
science
field
and
half
of
our
students
did
syntax
exercises
the
other
half
of
professionals
and
students
had
no
exposure
to
syntax
to
compare
our
purpose
is
to
find
if
teaching
students
syntax
exercises
are
still
relevant
and
can
teach
both
technical
and
computational
thinking
skills
with
the
introduction
of
computer
programming
in
schools
around
the
world
a
myriad
of
guides
are
being
published
to
support
educators
who
are
teaching
this
subject
often
for
the
first
time
most
of
these
books
offer
a
learning
path
based
on
the
experience
of
the
experts
who
author
them
in
this
paper
we
propose
and
investigate
an
alternative
way
of
determining
the
most
suitable
learning
paths
by
analyzing
projects
developed
by
learners
hosted
in
public
repositories
therefore
we
downloaded
250
projects
of
different
types
from
the
scratch
online
platform
and
identified
the
differences
and
clustered
them
based
on
a
quantitative
measure
the
computational
thinking
score
provided
by
dr
scratch
we
then
triangulated
the
results
by
qualitatively
studying
in
detail
the
source
code
of
the
prototypical
projects
to
explain
the
progression
required
to
move
from
one
cluster
to
the
next
one
the
result
is
a
data-driven
itinerary
that
can
support
teachers
and
policy
makers
in
the
creation
of
a
curriculum
for
learning
to
program
aiming
to
generalize
this
approach
we
discuss
a
potential
recommender
tool
populated
with
data
from
public
repositories
to
allow
educators
and
learners
creating
their
own
learning
paths
contributing
thus
to
a
personalized_learning
connected
with
students
interests
digital
tools
have
become
more
essential
in
education
and
business
areas
these
days
and
it
is
important
to
start
in
the
early
stages
of
education
eg
already
in
the
preschool
stage
this
paper
describes
the
development
and
pilot
testing
of
an
android
based
serious
gaming
app
for
mobile
devices
called
pic2program
the
app
aims
to
teach
children
the
basics
of
computational
thinking
ct
in
a
playful
way
the
gameplay
expects
the
young
children
to
steer
successfully
their
in-game
character
with
the
help
of
an
intuitive
symbol
language
through
a
set
of
increasingly
complex
mazes
the
children
may
even
draw
sets
of
symbols
by
hand
thus
develop
a
basic
program
pic2programs
image
recognition
module
will
then
process
these
symbols
by
first
photographing
them
with
an
android
device
and
then
using
a
neural
network
to
map
the
photos
to
program
instructions
the
effectivity
of
pic2program
on
learning
ct
has
been
evaluated
by
a
designed
course
for
9th
graders
the
results
show
that
students
find
the
app
well-structured
and
help
them
to
understand
the
basics
of
programming
scratch
is
a
programming
environment
which
is
widely
adopted
as
the
first
language
to
enter
the
programming
world
since
scratch
projects
are
rich
in
multimedia
resources
it
can
be
time-consuming
to
judge
them
by
hand
requiring
manual
execution
with
the
understanding
of
each
project
auto-judgment
tools
come
into
being
they
can
rapidly
evaluate
the
project
in
some
way
unfortunately
the
existing
tools
are
too
rigid
and
they
ignore
the
diversity
of
scratch
projects
to
address
this
issue
we
propose
a
new
dynamic
weighted
evaluation
system
dwes
first
we
define
a
new
computational
thinking
ct
evaluation
criteria
from
eight
aspects
second
based
on
the
proposed
criteria
we
present
an
analysis
tool
that
automatically
assesses
the
ct
skills
of
the
learners’
projects
third
considering
the
characteristics
of
projects
we
dynamically
adjust
the
evaluation
results
according
to
types
so
that
a
single
standard
is
no
longer
applied
roughly
to
all
this
process
is
data-driven
we
consider
the
ct
performance
and
scripts
of
projects
we
prove
the
rationality
of
the
evaluation
criteria
from
the
aspect
of
program
complexity
through
the
correlation
analysis
between
dwes
ct
scores
and
experts’
ratings
we
find
that
compared
with
dr
scratch
the
correlation
coefficient
has
increased
computational
thinking
ct
skills
are
generally
regarded
as
a
basic
ability
for
problem-solving
and
are
gradually
filtering
down
to
younger
age
groups
existing
research
has
attempted
to
increase
interaction
and
enhance
the
learning
interest
of
elementary_school
students
through
block-based
programming
environments
represented
by
scratch
however
criticism
suggests
that
this
approach
has
potential
long-term
constraints
on
ct
education
therefore
this
study
designed
a
game-based
project
to
investigate
students’
learning
motivation
and
ct
performance
in
different
programming
environments
a
total
of
108
fifth-grade
students
participated
in
the
experiment
and
were
divided
into
two
experimental
groups
eg1
and
eg2
and
a
control
group
cg
the
students
in
experimental
groups
all
undertook
game-based_learning
while
eg1
students
used
c
and
eg2
students
used
scratch
cg
students
used
c
for
traditional
algorithm-based
learning
findings
suggest
that
traditional
programming
languages
with
game-based_learning
can
also
substantially
improve
learning
interest
which
can
promote
the
efficiency
of
improving
ct
for
students
who
already
have
some
motivation
and
foundation
for
learning
but
for
students
who
still
lack
motivation
are
also
encouraged
to
develop
an
interest
in
a
block-based
programming
environment
teachers
can
choose
the
most
appropriate
approach
for
students
to
find
the
best
balance
between
learning
efficiency
and
long-term
interest
the
growing
interest
of
educational
researchers
in
computational
thinking
ct
has
led
to
an
expanding
literature
on
assessments
of
ct
skills
and
attitudes
however
few
studies
have
examined
whether
ct
attitudes
influence
ct

the
present

examines
the
relationship
between
ct

the
primary
issue
of
garbage
is
its
direct
impact
on
the
environment
and
quality
of
life
several
types
of
trash
have
piled
up
in
thailand
many
individuals
don’t
use
the
correct
way
of
waste
management
because
they
have
lacked
knowledge
and
understanding
of
how
to
sort
rubbish
since
childhood
to
increase
the
possibility
to
fully
utilize
the
knowledge
of
waste
separation
correctly
the
researcher
aims
to
promote
computational
thinking
through
the
learning
of
a
game
called
“trashman”
this
game
simulates
various
objects
for
situations
of
sorting
garbage
into
the
appropriate
sorting
bin
trashman
has
3
levels
in
the
game
each
level
increases
the
number
of
bins
and
the
amount
of
garbage
starting
from
level
1-3
which
refers
to
easy
moderate
and
difficult
levels
respectively
the
level
indicates
the
error
of
separating
the
waste
if
putting
it
into
a
wrong
bin
type
the
educating
about
different
types
of
waste
separation
through
the
game
utilizes

of
the

device
the
developer’s
expectation
for
an
alternative

medium
in
the
form
of
a
game
is
to
allow
players
to
apply
their
knowledge
by
practicing
computational

correctly
the
game
evaluates

summarizes
scores
of

this
will
evaluate

one
of
the
methods
to
develop

in
a
potentially
reciprocal
manner
using
developmentally
appropriate
educational

this
exploration
our
primary
focus
is
to
conduct
a
systematic

synthesizing
evidence
to
illuminate
the
interaction
between
ct

using
the
seven
powerful
ideas
from

our
initial

indicate
that

the
most

overall
the
findings
of
this

suggest
that
existing
mathematics
education
in

may
foster
the
development
of
ct
in
young

although
this

it
serves
as
a

endeavors
in
uncovering
the
interdisciplinary
nature
of

thus
contributing
to
the
advancement
of
this

are
widely
favored
by

however
in

ct’s
level
in
the
learning
computational

ct
skills
are
a
key
competency
for
all
citizens
but
for
computer
programming
students
these
abilities
are
crucial
several
studies
claim
that
students
have
deficits
in
many
of
the
ct
skills
and
therefore
it
is
important
to
develop
and
improve
these
skills
for
that
purpose
teachers
responsible
for
the
children’s
education
have
to
plan
as
soon
as
possible
effective
ways
for
training
ct
skills
there
are
already
many
learning
resources
lr
for
this
training
however
we
believe
that
neuroeducation
can
contribute
to
improving
the
impact
of
these
lr
in
the
teaching
and
learning
process
currently
educational
neuroscience
presents
a
solid
set
of
scientific
evidence
on
how
the
brain
learns
more
effectively
this
important
knowledge
about
the
brain’s
learning
process
can
be
turned
into
principles
applicable
in
education
this
paper
starts
emphasising
those
principles
that
can
benefit
the
teaching
and
learning
process
based
on
this
scientific
evidence
we
propose
the
adoption
of
a
set
of
guidelines
that
can
contribute
to
innovative
ct
training
neuroeducation
applies
the
latest
theoretical
advances
in
the
human
brain
and
psychology
to
pedagogy
the
guidelines
inspired
by
neuroeducation
that
we
propose
here
aim
to
provide
instructions
for
the
teacher
to
apply
in
their
pedagogical
practices
and
in
lr
in
order
to
promote
more
effective
training
one
concrete
lr
for
primary_school
created
by
our
master’s
students
in
computing
education
will
be
used
as
a
case
study
to
illustrate
our
proposal
in
order
to
expand
opportunities
to
learn
computer
science
cs
there
is
a
growing
push
for
inclusion
of
cs
concepts
and
practices
such
as
computational
thinking
ct
in
required
subjects
like
science
integrated
transdisciplinary
csctx
approaches
have
shown
promise
for
broadening
access
to
cs
and
ct
learning
opportunities
addressing
potential
self-selection
bias
associated
with
elective
cs
coursework
and
afterschool
programs
and
promoting
a
more
expansive
and
authentic
contextualization
of
cs
work
emerging
research
also
points
to
pedagogical
strategies
that
can
transcend
simply
broadening
access
by
also
working
to
confront
barriers
to
equitable
and
inclusive
engagement
in
cs
yet
approaches
to
integration
vary
widely
and
there
is
little
consensus
on
whether
and
how
different
models
for
cs
and
ct
integration
contribute
to
desired
outcomes
there
has
also
been
little
theory
development
that
can
ground
systematic
examination
of
the
affordances
and
tradeoffs
of
different
models
toward
that
end
we
propose
a
typology
through
which
to
examine
ct
integration
in
science
ct
s
the
purpose
of
delineating
a
typology
of
cts
integration
is
to
encourage
instantiation
implementation
and
inspection
of
different
models
for
integration
and
to
promote
shared
understanding
among
learning
designers
researchers
and
practitioners
working
at
the
intersection
of
ct
and
science
for
each
model
in
the
typology
we
characterize
how
cts
integration
is
accomplished
the
ways
in
which
ct
learning
supports
science
learning
and
the
affordances
and
tensions
for
equity
and
inclusion
that
may
arise
upon
implementation
in

ct
the
literature
provides
evidence
that
the

and
the
representation
of
the
problem
to
apply
sra-programming
require
the
programming
task
to
be
embedded
in
a

in
which
a

robot
must
use

to
anticipate

is
essential
for

gain
a
deeper

it
is
found
that

argue
for

we
do
that
by
proposing

all

were
implemented
using
the

robot-mediated
learning
activities
are
often
designed
as
collaborative
exercises
where
children
work
together
to
achieve
the
activity
objectives
although
miscommunications
and
misunderstandings
occur
frequently
humans
unlike

are
very
good
at
overcoming
them
and
converging
to
a

with
the
aim
of
equipping
a

and
exploring

in
this

we
investigate
how
a
humanoid
robot
can
collaborate
with
a
human
learner
to
construct
a
shared
solution
to
a
problem
via
suggesting
actions
and
disagreeing
with
each
other
concretely
we
designed
a
learning
activity
aiming
to
improve
the
computational

skills
of
children
in
which
the
robot
makes
suggestions
on
what
to
do
that
may
be
in

with
what
the
human
thinks
or
not
furthermore
the
robot
may
suggest
wrong
actions
that
could
essentially
prevent
them
from
finding
a
correct

via
a
pilot

conducted
remotely
with
9
school

we
investigate
whether
the

results
in
positive

how
the

evolves
and
how
these
relate
to

the
results
show
positive

for
the

in

of
finding
better

suggesting
that
the

with
the

might
have
helped
trigger

computational

crucial
for

we
believe
that
ct

should
be
developed

encouraged
from
a

however
to
promote
the

it
is
necessary
to
use
appropriate

we
call

it
is
important
that

this

that

year
he
can
find
the

also
get

this
process
helps

approach
across
domains
including
computer

especially
for

collaboration
among

with
diverse
experiences

can
be
especially
effective
however
there
is
limited
research
on
how
collaborative
interactions
among

from
different
undergraduate
disciplines
manifest
during
the

this
qualitative

interdisciplinary
student
groups
in
an

in
analyzing
the
social

the
differentiating
overt

used
as
a

several

framework
emerged
naturally
in
the
observations
however
several
categories
that
were
not
explicitly
stated
in
the

framework
also
emerged
these
are
asking
a

versus
asking
an
elaborate

socializing
being
confused
or
expressing
frustration
self-talk
and
struggle
analysis
of
interactions
between

revealed
that
most
of
the
group
interactions
were
active
in

barriers
to
collaborative_learning
were
accentuated
when
peers
were
novices
students
who
lacked
knowledge
of
computational_concepts
found
it
hard
to
contribute
to
a
discussion
hindering

whereas
students
who
had
better
conceptual
understanding
were
constructive
in
their
interactions
elaborated
on
a

made
connections
with

and
displayed
self-awareness
about

ct
has
become
an
indispensable
skill
in
the
21st
century
and
has
permeated
into
k-12
education
at
all
levels
the
evaluation
of

has
become
a
crucial
concern
for

and
researchers
currently
while
extensive
research
has
investigated
the
assessment
of
students
ct
conceptual
understanding
the
measurement
of
their

processes
is
less
involved
the
game-based
assessment
appears
to
address
this
issue
by
analyzing
students
behaviors
and
reactions
during
the
gameplay
process
which
has
become
an
emerging
assessment
tool
in
ct
education
this
drives
the
need
for
a
comprehensive
overview
of
this
field
to
fill
this
gap
this

aims
to
conduct
a
systematic

on
the
assessment
of

it
explores
ct

a
total
of
fifteen

were
examined
findings
indicate
that
algorithmic_thinking
problem

were
commonly
assessed
in

different
ways
for
assessing
ct
skills
in

were
identified
involving
progression

one
of
the

and
used
open-source

they
envisioned
how

they
worked
collaboratively
to

were
trained
to
integrate

as
well
as

that
would
expose

because
it
is
written
in
a

was
carried
out
with

the
results
show
that
some
students
presented
an
overall
learning
gain
while
others
performed
worse
in
the
posttest
than
in
the
pretest
a
motivational
questionnaire
based
in
the
self-determination
theory
supports
the
idea
that
students
perceived
the
activity
as
difficult
lowering
their
sense
of
autonomy
and

raising
pressure
and
thus
negatively

suggest
that
higher

were
obtained
for

rather
than
for

and
arithmetic
operations
with

the
increased
push
for
access
to
computer

cs
at
the
k-12
level
has
been
argued
as
a
way
to
broaden
participation
in
computing
at
the
elementary

computational

ct
has
been
used
as
a
framework
for
bringing
cs
ideas
into
the
classroom
and
educating
teachers
about
how
they
can
integrate
ct
into
their
daily

a
number
of
these
projects
have
made
equity
a
central
goal
of
their
work
by
working
in

with
diverse
racial
linguistic
and
economic

however
we
know
little
about
whether
and
how
teachers
equitably
engage
students
in
ct
during
their
classroom
instruction-particularly
during
science
and
math
lessons
in
this

we
present
an
approach
to
analyzing

httpswwwequipninja
the
purpose
of
this

is
to
examine
the
quantity
and
quality
of
students
contributions
during
ct-integrated
math
and
science
lessons
and
how
it
differs
based
on
demographic
markers
we
highlight
this
approach
using
classroom
video
observation
from
four
teachers
and
discuss
future
work
in
this
area
several
investigations
state
the
low

this
fact
implies
a

this
paper
exposes
two
unplugged_activities
taken
from
a
series
of
activities
implemented
with
elementary
students
and
families
in
madrid
spain
the
general
objectives
are
to
introduce
and
motivate
interest
from
an
early
age
in
computer
programming
and
the
development
of
gender
dynamics
that
educate
about
gender
equity
to
strengthen
female
empowerment
in
this
context
whereas
the
imperialist
competitive
algorithm
ica
shows
limited
global
search
ability
and
be
liable
to
be
trapped
into
local

a
double-assimilation
of

oriented
improved
imperialist

dpdo-iic
a
is
proposed
tentatively
to
overcome
inherent
defects
the
imperialist
assimilation
and
colonial

strategy
are
customized
purposefully
and
a
novel
population
redistribution
mechanism
is
introduced
as
well
the
three
improvement
measures
are
supposed
to
further
promote
population
diversity
and
searching
accuracy
the
cec2017
test
set
is
selected
to
verify
the
performance
of
the
dpdo-iica
by
the
different
types
of
numerical
function
problems
with
the
different
dimensions
moreover
the
dpdo-iica
is
compared
with
the
three
first-class
intelligent
optimization
algorithms
which
have
achieved
significant
rankings
in
the
cec2017
competition
the
comparison
shows
that
the
dpdo-iica
has
good
performances
which
is
demonstrated
by
the
accuracy
and
stability
in
addition
the
proportion
of
imperialists
and
colonies
is
investigated
and
it
is
through
the
community
partitioning
and
clustering
dynamically
to
enhance
the
population
diversity
in
conclusion
the
dpdo-iica
can
effectively
improve
the
ability
of
global
exploration
and
avoid
premature
convergence
in
comparison
with
the
original
ica
occasionally
there
may
be
a
low
impact
on
learning
engagement
between
teachers
and
students
due
to
for
example
poor
internet
connection
or
simply
because
students
have
lost
their
focus
one
of
the
methods
to
improve
learning
engagement
is
through
a
research
framework
called
unified
theory
acceptance
and
use
of
technology
utaut
this
paper
adopted
17
utaut
questions
to
compare
with
research
variables
pre-post

the
user
acceptance
and
use

or
utaut
consisted
of
likert

questions
computed
to
generate
total
scores
for
each
participant
then
the
scores
will
be
compared
to
each
variable
to
investigate
the
relationships
between
these
variables
against
the
utaut
this
study
could
be
implemented
via
online
learning
but
in
the
end
the
offline
unplugged
method
was
the
only
method
to
deliver
the
learning
activities
there
is
limited
evidence
discussing
utaut
within
the
area
of
offline
learning
hence
this
paper
will
focus
on
another
spectrum
regarding
the
utaut
study
instead
of
mobile
online

indicated
that
the
unplugged

approach
has
a
significant

relationship
with

it
revealed
that
students
may
also
demonstrate
an
interest
in
online

and
be
able
to
comprehensively
accept
the
online

approach
in
contrast
mann-whitney

revealed
no
significant

the
findings
could
contribute
to
another
noteworthy
discussion
regarding
the
validity
of

and
the
use
of

against
the
unplugged
learning
approach
this
research-track
work-in-progress
paper
contributes
to
engineering
education
by
documenting
progress
in
developing
a
new
standard
engineering
computational
thinking
diagnostic
to
measure
engineering
student
success
in
five
factors
of
computational
thinking
over
the
past
year
results
from
an
initial
validation
attempt
were
used
to
refine
diagnostic
questions
a
second
statistical
validation
attempt
was
then
completed
in
spring
2021
with
191
student
participants
at
three
universities
statistics
show
that
all
diagnostic
questions
had
statistically
significant
factor
loadings
onto
one
general
computational
thinking
factor
that
incorporates
the
five
original
factors
of
a
abstraction
b
algorithmic_thinking
c
decomposition
d
data
representation
and
organization
and
e
impact
of
computing
this
result
was
unexpected
as
our
goal
was
a
diagnostic
that
could
discriminate
among
the
five
factors
a
small
population
size
caused
by
the
virtual
delivery
of
courses
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
may
be
the
explanation
and
a
third
round
of
validation
in
fall
2021
is
expected
to
result
in
a
larger
population
given
the
return
to
face-to-face
instruction
when
statistical
validation
is
completed
the
diagnostic
will
help
institutions
identify
students
with
strong
entry
level
skills
in
computational
thinking
as
well
as
students
that
require
academic
support
the
diagnostic
will
inform
curriculum
design
by
demonstrating
which
factors
are
more
accessible
to
engineering
students
and
which
factors
need
more
time
and
focus
in
the
classroom
the
long-term
impact
of
a
successfully
validated
computational
thinking
diagnostic
will
be
introductory
engineering
courses
that
better
serve
engineering
students
coming
from
many
backgrounds
this
can
increase
student
self-efficacy
improve
student
retention
and
improve
student
enculturation
into
the
engineering
profession
currently

students
whose
goal
is
to
increase
their
interest
in
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
in
the
particular
case
of
computer

it
allows
developing
computational

skills
it
has
been
designed
with
ease
of
use
in
mind
this
free
tool
is
available
through
a
web
browser
and
does
not
need
a
complex
installation
or
specific
hardware
requirements
allowing
educational
robotics
to
be
introduced
to
a
wide
range
of
users
by
working
on
practical
projects
that
will
help
them
understand
key
concepts
of
robotics
and
programming
the
effectiveness
of
roblocklly
has
been
validated
based
on
motivation
usability
and
user
experience
criteria
the
tool
was
validated
with
212
secondary_school
students
12–16
years
old
specifically
motivation
was
measured
with
the
intrinsic
motivation
inventory
usability
with
the
system
usability
scale
and
user
experience
with
the
user
experience
questionnaire
generally
speaking
the
results
demonstrate
that
students
perceived
roblocklly
as
a
novel
and
interesting
tool
the
ratings
for
usability
were
predominantly
positive
although
a
few
students
indicated
a
preference
for
expert
assistance
the
overall
rating
of
the
user
experience
was
positive
as
well
yet
notable
differences
in
attitudes
toward
motivation
and
usability
were
observed
between
genders
this
study
investigates
the
relationship
between
two
related
computational
thinking
practices
data
practices
and
computational
problem-solving
practices
in
acquiring
related
computational
thinking
practices
during
a
first-year
undergraduate
engineering
course
while
computational
thinking
theory
is
still
developing
empirical
studies
can
help
further
understand
how
students
demonstrate
this
knowledge
and
their
progression
in
attaining
the
practices
therefore
with
this
empirical
study
the
following
questions
are
addressed
rq1
what
are
the
differences
in
students
computational
thinking
practices
at
the
beginning
of
an
undergraduate
introductory
programming
course
rq
2
how
do
these
differences
correspond
to
the
acquisition
of
more
advanced
computational
thinking
practices
the
use
of
a
descriptive
non-experimental
design
that
aims
to
understand
the
correlation
between
practices
related
to
data
and
computational
problem-solving
is
presented
a
machine
learning
technique
is
employed
utilizing
historical
data
from
introductory
programming
for
a
problem-solving
course
with
more
than
1000
first-year
engineering
students
after
identifying
groups
of
students
defining
different
profiles
data
from
posterior
performance
in
more
advanced
programming
topics
were
descriptively
analyzed
this
study
supports
the
characterization
of
four
different
student
profiles
demonstrating
differences
in
their
performance
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
from
these
four
profiles
two
of
them
show
a
subsequent
differential
progression
besides
their
similarity
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
in
this
particular
case
troubleshooting
and
debugging
appear
as
a
relevant
competency
when
distinguishing
these
two
learners
groups
these
findings
suggest
that
previous
knowledge
or
exposure
to
different
practices
can
result
in
different
progressions
of
more
complex
computational
practices
emphasizing
the
relevance
of
troubleshooting
and
debugging
as
a
practice
required
for
a
successful
and
timely
progression
on
the
acquisition
of
other
computational
thinking
practices

in
the
changing
conditions
of
professional

a
higher

institution
requires
the
introduction
of
new
approaches
to
teaching
that
ensure
the
development
of
professional
creative
information
and
communicative
competencies
of
graduates
the

presents
the
discipline
“numerical
methods”
and
“theory
of
computational

which
are
basic
for
students
in
the
field
of
applied
mathematics
and
computer

the
knowledge
skills
and
abilities
obtained
while
studying
the

will
make
it
possible
to
carry
out
applied
projects
in
the
field
of
mathematics
natural

operations
research
and
machine

these
disciplines
can
also
be
recommended
to
students
in
the
areas
of
training
applied
informatics
and
mathematical
support
of

systems
due
to
the
importance
of
mastering
this

and
subsequent
use
in
solving

often
have
to
balance
the
priorities
of
bridging
the
gap
between
the
level
of
student
preparation
and
the
expected
level
of
preparedness
as
influenced
by
industry
and

prioritization
of
these
standards
does
not
always
align

the
challenges
experienced
by
an
hbcu

it
is
important
to
note
there
is
no

that
directly
addresses
the
use
of

this
document
presents
the
results
of
the
development
of
a
learning
program
on
computational
thinking
through
programming
challenges
with
robots
oriented
to
early
childhood
the
methodological
approach
used
was
quantitative
using
a
quasi-experimental
design
taking
pretestposttest
measures
with
experimental
and
control
groups
the
sample
of
participating
students
was
46
they
belonged
to
a
group
of
first
grade
of
primary_education
aged
between
6
and
7
years
in
a
spanish
educational
center
the
learning
of
computational
thinking
was
measured
through
the
following
dimensions
algorithmic_thinking-sequences
abstraction-patterns
and
debugging
the
learning
activities
used
were
an
adaptation
of
the
activities
proposed
in
the
“tangiblek”
robotics
curriculum
the
results
generated
show
positive
effects
in
relation
to
the
level
of
achievement
reached
by
the
students
in
the
proposed
challenges
in
other
words
there
is
a
significant
effect
on
the
mastery
of
skills
related
to
computational
thinking
differences
were
found
between
the
pretest
and
posttest
measures
of
the
experimental
group
those
of
the
latter
group
were
statistically
significant
and
higher
than
those
of
the
control
group
therefore
we
can
statistically
attribute
the
mastery
of
computational
thinking
skills
to
the
participation
in
the
training
activities
computational
thinking
is
irrefutably
a
must-have
skill
in
todays
digital
world
this
is
why
it
is
a
requisite
course
in
most
college
curricula
computational
thinking
is
a
broad
term
encompassing
fundamental
concepts
of
computing
such
as
formulating
problems
and
expressing
their
solutions
in
computational
steps
that
can
be
processed
by
a
computer
the
ability
to
organize
and
analyze
data
is
also
a
part
of
computational
thinking
following
this
paradigm
educational
institutions
have
adopted
various
methods
to
teach
computational
thinking
including
programming
this
paper
will
explore
a
specific
project
within
the
computational
thinking
course
taught
as
an
introductory
course
in
all
major
programs
at
the
higher
colleges
of
technology
in
the
united
arab
emirates
the
intention
of
the
paper
is
to
demonstrate
how
a
project-based
data
analytics
assessment
in
such
a
course
can
be
used
to
foster
in
students
a
greater
awareness
of
a
contemporary
and
critical
global
issue
such
as
waste
management
to
examine
the
effectiveness
of
this
project
the
paper
documents
and
evaluates
the
work
of
a
group
of
students
who
carried
out
data
analysis
on
secondary
data
collected
from
a
notable
website
on
“waste
management”
the
methodology
implemented
for
this
task
is
developed
based
on
a
prescribed
course
syllabus
and
assessment
structure
which
promotes
student-centered
and
inter-disciplinary
learning
the
development
of
computational
thinking
as
a
cognitive
skill
is
crucial
in
the
digital
age
however
there
remains
no
consensus
on
its
definition
or
measurement
this
study
aims
to
address
this
gap
by
developing
an
instrument
to
estimate
the
level
of
computational
thinking
using
an
evidence-centered
design
approach
the
proposed
framework
integrates
cognitive
theory
educational
research
and
psychometric
modeling
to
create
a
comprehensive
and
reliable
assessment
tool
the
instrument
consists
of
two
scenarios
with
a
total
of
59
items
divided
into
six
questions
it
was
validated
by
experts
in
the
field
achieving
a
content
validity
index
of
076
the
test
was
administered
to
a
sample
of
100
students
from
three
secondary
schools
in
lima
peru
and
analyzed
using
bayesian
confirmatory_factor_analysis
and
parametric
tests
the
results
indicate
that
the
model
effectively
assesses
algorithmic_thinking
critical_thinking
and
problem_solving
skills
regardless
of
prior
programming
experience
however
the
assessment
of
creativity
requires
further
refinement
this
research
contributes
to
evidence-based
educational
policy
and
practice
in
secondary_education
offering
a
foundation
for
future
improvements
in
the
evaluation
of
computational
thinking
this
work
is
the
result
of
an
investigation
carried
out
within
the
framework
of
a
research
grant
the
work
experience
that
this
team
carried
out
was
aimed
at
describing
and
systematizing
the
configuration
of
computational
thinking
its
incidence
and
validity
in
the
educational
field
from
the
analysis
of
public
policies
from
an
interdisciplinary
approach
the
experience
carried
out
was
developed
based
on
a
bibliographic
and
documentary
analysis
work
which
allowed
recovering
the
concept
of
computational
thinking
to
analyze
it
in
conjunction
with
the
development
of
critical
pedagogical
practice
and
the
concept
of
competences
here
an
analysis
of
some
of
the
current
debates
presented
by
computational
thinking
and
its
teaching
is
presented
in
order
to
promote
a
line
of
dialogue
and
problematization
between
what
was

is
projected
on
this

robotics
was
particularly
negatively
affected
by
this
period
in
our
country
educational
robotics
is
usually
taught
in
informatics
classes
however
in
many
schools
the
teaching
of
informatics
during
the
lockdown
was
very
limited
and
often
focused
only
on
basic
digital
skills
as
a
similar
situation
occurred
in
several
european
countries
the
idea
of
supporting
teachers
in
such
cases
was
proposed
within
an
international

we
are
involved
in
a

being
designed
to
develop
computational

is
based
on
the
idea
of

we
describe
the
planning

we
focused
primarily
on

have
a
fundamental
role
in
successfully
overcoming
them
even
though
they
are
not
serious

and
have
been

is
the
fun
part

allows
assessing

more
and
more
colleges
have
offered
introductory

courses
for

from
different
majors
aiming
to
cultivate
students
computational

skills
however
teaching
introductory

courses
especially
to

remains
a
challenging
endeavor
despite
a

in
this

we
presented
our
innovative
teaching
strategy
and
its
implementation
both
with
the
utilization
of

in
an
introductory
python

course
the
results
from

show
that

could
benefit
students
a
lot
in

and
improving
their

computational

is
considered
critical
for

argument
has
been
instrumental
in
promoting
block-based
languages
such
as

with
limited
success
in
contrast
we
believe
that
expressing
the
logic
of
computational
problems
in
the
student’s
language
is
more
convenient
and
natural
in
such
an
environment
learners
will
experience
the
least
impedance
mismatch
between
their

we
demonstrate
that

helps
to

and
assists
in
validating

an
argument
is
also
made
as
to
why
using
a
natural

a
computational

ct
contest
that
does
not
require
programming
knowledge
numerous
studies
in
the
last
decade
shed
light
on
disseminating
ct
practices
however
there
is
still
a
gap
in
understanding
ct
as
a
construct
that
is
ct
as
a
complex
cognitive
dimension
furthermore
few
studies
analyze
how
many
constructs
can
be
recognized
inside
ct
by
empirical
data
moreover
algorithmic_thinking
is
one
of
the
essential
skills
in
ct
even
when
we
do
not
apply
programming
activities
in
this
exploratory
paper
we
investigate
the
bebras
challenge
tasks
our
primary
aim
is
to
figure
out
how
many
and
which
are
the
constructs
associated
with
ct
skills
derived
from
data
especially
related
to
algorithmic_thinking
the
results
point
out
three
primary
constructs
supported
by

we
claim
that
these
constructs
are
a
mix
of
ct
skills
mainly
algorithmic_thinking
abstraction
generalization
evaluation
and
pattern
recognition
in
addition
our
study
provides
additional
evidence
supporting
the
idea
that
algorithmic_thinking
can
be
explored
by
different
perspectives
beyond
“a
set
of
order
instructions”
even
without
programming
practices
thus
this
result
reinforces
the
notion
that
ct
can
be
understood
as
a
mix
of
several
skills
to
solve
problems
moreover
algorithmic_thinking
is
a
complex
cognitive
process
of
thought
which
may
be
explored
through
different
strategies
we
believe
that
these
findings
may
help
recognize
which

this
paper
explores
a
survey
instrument
on

ct
and

towards

for
educational
purposes
given
the
well-known
skills
demanded
for
the
21st

ct
needs
to
be
known
in
the
teacher
community
one
crucial
aspect
in
this
regard
is
the
perceptions
that
students
hold
on
the
subject
as
well
as
on
computing
in
general
various
studies
have
been
carried
out
to

students
attitudes

however
assessing
the
understanding
of
ct

computing
attitudes
in

particularly
in

education
has
not
been
fully
explored
yet
most
current
instruments
are
either
not
aimed
at
educators
or
not
designed
to
cover
elements
related
to
both
ct

computing
in
this
work
our
goal
was
to
evaluate
a
survey
instrument
on
perceptions
of
ct
and
attitudes
towards
computing
for
undergraduate
students
our
evaluation
focused
on
verifying
whether
the
instrument
could
grasp
the
aspects
involved
in
five
different
intended
constructs
1
understanding
of

2
application
of

3
confidence

4
interest

we
computed
its
reliability
and
used

results
to
measure
its

results
showed
evidence
that
the
instrument
is
both
reliable
and
valid
to
measure
impressions
of
ct

in

in

an

this
is
part
of
the
unplugged

framework
development
process
where
the
first
element
investigated
is
the
type
of

two

confirm
the

the

the

the
next
step
of

is
to
identify
other
relevant
components

automatic
grading
systems

lessen
the
load
of
manual
grading
most
existent
autograders
are
based
on
unit
testing
which
focuses
on
the
correctness
of
the
code
but
has
limited
scope
for
judging
code
quality
moreover
it
is
cumbersome
to
implement
unit
testing
for
evaluating
graphical
output
code
we
propose
an
autograder
that
can
effectively
judge
the
code
quality
of
the
visual
output
codes
created
by
students
enrolled
in
a
high_school-level
computational

course
we
aim
to
provide
suggestions
to
teachers
on
an
essential
aspect
of
their
grading
namely
the
level
of
student
com-petency
in
using
abstraction
within
their
codes
a
dataset
from
five
different
assignments
including
open-ended
problems
is
used
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
our
autograder
our
initial
experiments
show
that
our
method
can
classify
the
students
submissions
even
for
open-ended
problems
where
existing
autograders
fail
to
do
so
additionally
survey
responses
from
course
teachers
support
the
importance
of
our
work
the
scientific
and
reasonable
evaluation
indicators
that
can
fully
reflect
the
various
dimensions
of
students
computational

is
the
basis
and
premise
of
accurately
evaluating
students
ct
skills
which
is
of
great
significance
to
the
cultivation
of
students
ct
skills
however
the
current
research
on
how
to
construct
the
evaluation
indicators
is
still
inadequate
and
most
of
the
research
is
put
forward
by
the
subjective
experience
of
researchers
lacking
objectivity
and
the
universality
of

in
the

we
comprehensively
reviewed
the
concepts

aiming
to
construct
the
comprehensive
and
effective
evaluation
indicators
of
ct
for
students
by
clustering
the
keywords
of
ct
concepts
and
extracting
indicators
the
validity
of
indicators
is
verified
by
qualitative
analysis
quantitative
analysis
and
expert
evaluation
the
results
show
that
the
evaluation
indicators
of
ct
constructed
by
spectral
clustering
technology
are
a
more
scientific
more
comprehensive
reflection
of
the

proposes
a
block-based

which
are
all
core
concepts
of

the
idea
is
to

recently
arguments
have
been
standing
in

a
methodological
proposal
which
integrates
key
aspects
to
facilitate
the
effective
integration
of

programming
in
primary_education
through
collaborative
and
gamifying
strategies
furthermore
concrete

are
presented
which
have
been
formulated
thanks
to
applying
the
proposed
methodological
approach
to

the
narratives
upon

are
based
incorporate

cores
presented
in
the

this
work
reports
an
innovative
product-based
pedagogy
that
was
developed
by
incorporating
entrepreneurial
education
into
the
upper-level
undergraduate
and
graduate
courses
in
the
electrical
engineering
department
at
the
university
of
texas
ut
at
tyler
several
aspects
make
this
work
different
from
existing
research
we
adopted
an
iterative
challenge-based
star
cycle
and
investigated
the
effectiveness
of
computational
thinking
in
our
course
projects
in
addition
entrepreneurial
components
were
incorporated
into
a
series
of
senior
and
graduate-level
courses
with
the
goal
of
creating
student
entrepreneurs
the
entrepreneurship-focused
curriculum
encouraged
students
to
participate
in
regional
pitch
competitions
and
conference
presentations
the
findings
from
this
work
suggest
a
positive
impact
of
entrepreneurial
learning
on
student
learning
outcomes
the
teaching
of
programming
in
primary
and
secondary_education
has
once
again
revealed
the
heterogeneity
of
the
ways
in
which
students
learn
and
instructors
teach
such
a
capability
language
barriers
and
technological
skills
of
the
involved
people
are
some
of
the
factors
that
affect
the
usability
and
usefulness
of
educational
programming
environments
this
article
presents
a
gamified
programming
environment
called
damos
quest
that
supports
middle
school
instructors
while
they
teach
programming
to
students
who
have
little
access
to
computer
technology
and
proficiency
in
english
language
the
platform
offers
a
gamified-educational
experience
in
which
students
must
deal
with
challenges
in
fantasy
stories
in
virtual
worlds
by
programming
various
solutions
the
usability
and
perceived
usefulness
of
the
first
version
of
this
tool
have
been
evaluated
by
two
researchers
who
are
experts
in
computational

although
preliminary
the
results
are
highly
encouraging
we
demonstrate

learning
programming
language
syntax
is
considered
an
obstacle
in
programming
education
however
we
believe
it
is
an
overlooked
opportunity
to
exploit
obvious
synergies
with
math
as
evidenced
around
the
world
middle
and
high_school
students
know
the
syntax
required
to
compute
simple
expressions
without
previous
exposure
to
programming
languages
we
make
the
case
for
an
“expressions
first”
approach
to
facilitate
the
development
of
computational
thinking
our
approach
has
the
benefit
of
integrating
directly
with
math
which
in
turn
reinforces
the
teaching
of
other
stem
subjects
as
well
as
non-stem
ones
we
report
early
results
of
an
ongoing
trial
using
a
visual
computing
environment
that
supports
this
approach
the
logical
equivalence
of
selection
structure
in
different
programming
languages
is
common
sense
but
it
is
difficult
for
junior
high_school
students
to
understand
the
relationship
this
thesis
is
based
on
this
exploration
and
practice
so
that
students
can
solve
the
programming
problems
encountered
when
designing
app
on
the
app
inventor
platform
through
the
smart
planting
project
and
on
the
basis
of
mastering
the
content
of
the
new
textbook
c
language
so
as
to
improve
students’
computational
thinking
and
the
ability
to
analyze
problems
and
solve
problems
the
jigsaw
pedagogy
as
a
student-centered
instructional
approach
has
been
successfully
applied
in
information
technology
classrooms
but
there
is
a
lack
of
empirical
research
on
the
effectiveness
of
jigsaw
pedagogy
in
unplugged
environments
therefore
this
study
combined
the
jigsaw
pedagogy
with
unplugged_activities
and
verified
the
teaching
effect
of
such
a
combination
through
randomized
group
experiments
the
results
of
the
study
showed
that
the
combination
of
the
jigsaw
pedagogy
and
the
unplugged_activities
was
more
conducive
to
promoting
students
motivation
and
the
development
of
computational

than
the
unplugged

a
mixed-methods
approach
was
employed
combining
quantitative

the
study
focused
on
block
coding
particularly
using
the

the
findings
reveal
that
block

highlighting
the
importance
of

were
led
by
a
long-time

who
worked
to
curate
relevant

and
delivered
the

to
be
valuable
furthermore
feedback
from

suggests
that
access
to
these
short
just-in-time
pd

provided
valuable

and
also
sparked
new

however
the
ubiquity
of
cloud
computing
and
the
simplicity
of
modern

languages
such
as

have
enabled
non-stem

to
leverage
it
especially
to

similarly
with
what
has
been

this
article
aims
to
present
a
proposal
for
improving
the
teaching
of
data
science
specifically
to
non-stem
students
introducing
middle
school
students
to
steam
projects
can
foster
an
interest
in
computer
science
and
engineering
solutions
these
projects
provide
hands-on
experiences
that
may
encourage
students
to
explore
careers
in
science
technology
engineering
art
and
mathematics
engaging
students
in
real-world
problems
can
help
them
develop
critical_thinking
skills
and
generate
innovative
ideas
steam
projects
can
also
spark
students
curiosity
and
creativity
this
paper
will
explore
developing
and
implementing
a
steam
lesson
to
introduce
students
to
the
engineering
and
design
process
and
computational

moreover
this
project
also
addresses
a
major
environmental
concern
currently
in
new
jersey
specifically
the
destruction
of
the
environment
by
the
spotted
lanternfly
therefore
students
are
also
applying
skills
in
civil
duty
and
environmental
awareness
as
a
part
of
their
design
and
plan
to
eradicate
this
invasive
species
over
the
past
decade
the
teaching
of
coding
and
computational
thinking
has
become
increasingly
important
in
the
school
environment
if
before
they
were
a
secondary
part
of
the
teaching
program
and
provided
only
at
best
from
the
age
of
eleven
and
up
it
is
now
clear
that
they
should
play
a
relevant
role
in
the
school
curriculum
as
soon
as
possible
in
recent
years
many
solutions
both
papery
and
software
applications
have
been
developed
for
encoding
however
the
remaining
problem
is
that
every
available
solution
has
been
designed
for
a
very
precise
and
limited
scope
both
of
age
and
skills
without
thinking
of
a
more
generalizable
use
for
a
long
period
this
work
therefore
aims
to
choose
some
of
the
tools
available
designed
for
different
needs
but
sufficiently
similar
in
order
to
allow
the
development
of
a
fluid

path
gradually
adding

that
is
commonly
taught

degrees
often
in

modeling
includes
various

processes
like
abstraction
reduction

generalization
among
others
that
are
part
of
computational

too
our
hypothesis
is
that
using
different

can
be
a
good
way
to

included
two
different

simultaneously
students
had
to
attend
to
a
secondary

which
consisted
of
responding
to
an
auditory

after
which
they
had
to
press
a

finally
students
completed
a

in

character

and
the

is
relatively
complex

which
makes
it
difficult
for

to
understand
in
this
paper
a
virtual

is
proposed
to
this
process
by
using
blockly

other

students
can
independently
design

and
write

to
describe
the
whole

of
character
processing
relying
on
virtual

and
human-computer

technology
the
whole
process
of
character
processing
can
be
visually
demonstrated
it
enables
students
to
deeply
understand
the

and
deepens
the

the

are
suitable
for

which
can
also
better
cultivate

analytical
problem-solving
skills
and
enhance
their
logical_thinking
however
only
a
part
of

and
students
are
currently
learning
this
programming
and
it
is
not
popular
enough
yet
moreover
if
the
teaching
is
mainly
based
on
the
teacher’s
explanation
it
will
be
boring
therefore
there
is
a
need
to
explore
the
teaching
based
on
game
design
and
combine
teaching
with
fun
so
that
learning
can
become
a
more
acceptable
“game”
for

making
the

atmosphere
more
active

in
this

we
create

curate
projects
that
let
students
learn
certain
computational_concepts
in
a
consistent
way
that
bridges
story

our
approach
is
to
provide
young
children
with
both
visual
and
text-based
programming
materials
that
are
directly
associated
with
the
computational
logic
in
some
selected
children’s
daily
dialogues
and
stories
we
demonstrate
this
combo-design
idea
with
examples
of
roleplaying
snap
program
and
python
code
our
design
pattern
and
examples
could
be
adapted
to
other
suitable
children’s
activities
in
different
school
settings
on
a
variety
of
technology
platforms
one
of
the
ways
to
demonstrate
subject-domain
concepts
is
to
let
the
learner
play
in
the
domain-related
sandbox
while
receiving
the
explanations
of
the
domain
laws
that
were
broken
when
the
user
makes
a
wrong
move
this
can
help
the
learners
who
understand
definitions
of
the
concepts
poorly
we
present
two
visual
simulators
for
demonstrating
concept
properties
and
domain
laws
implemented
as
web

they
can
be
used
to
study

learning
to
use
computational

is
a
critical
aspect
of
many
first-year
engineering
courses
students
in
these
courses
can
have
varying
degrees
of
prior
exposure
to
computational
tools
and
often
exhibit
a
wide
range
of
intrinsic
motivation
for
learning
these
skills
interviews
with
first-year
engineering
students
were
conducted
to
study
the
degree
to
which
motivation
correlated
with
intended
major
within
engineering
the
pilot
round
of

was
conducted
in

this
innovative

was
implemented
at
a

in
an
introduction
to

course
course
assessments
included
weekly
homework
assignments
an
open-ended

one
quiz
and
three
midterm
exams
students
were
explicitly
told
in
class
and
in
the
syllabus
that
no
ai
was
allowed
for
weekly
homework
assignments
however
students
were
encouraged
to
use
ai
for
the
open-ended
project
this
decision
was
made
because
the
problems
on
weekly
assignments
were
more
structured
and
could
be
easily
solved
by
ai
tools
in
comparison
the
learning
objective
of
the
project
was
focused
on
code

with
open-ended
requirements
making
it
harder
for
ai
to
provide
workable

students
who
reported
using
ai
indicated
that
they
used
it
to
help
start
the

andor
a
piece
of
the

and
to
aid
in
debugging
or
finding

project
grades
were
similar
to
grades
seen
in
previous
years
for
similar

however
grades
on
midterm
two
which
occurred
after
the

were
surprisingly
higher
than
the

studies
demonstrating
how

are
rare
thus
we
discussed
the
need
to
introduce

by
presenting

further
technical

industry
case
studies
are
needed
to
demonstrate
evidence
of
the

the
implication
is
not

was
proposed
to
keep

with
high

of
gang
enrollment
off

while
providing

the

supported
a

we
refactored

and
present
our

learned
from
the
experience
over
the
past
decades
numerous
practical

of
machine

techniques
have
shown
the
potential
of
ai-driven
and
data-driven
approaches
in
a
large
number
of
computing
fields
machine
learning
is
increasingly
included
in
computing
curricula
in
higher_education
and
a
quickly
growing
number
of
initiatives
are
expanding
it
in
k-12
computing
education
too
as
machine
learning
enters
k-12
computing
education
understanding
how
intuition
and
agency
in
the
context
of
such
systems
is
developed
becomes
a
key
research
area
but
as
schools
and
teachers
are
already
struggling
with
integrating
traditional
computational
thinking
and
traditional
artificial
intelligence
into
school
curricula
understanding
the
challenges
behind
teaching
machine
learning
in
k-12
is
an
even
more
daunting
challenge
for
computing
education
research
despite
the
central
position
of
machine
learning
and
ai
in
the
field
of
modern
computing
the
computing
education
research
body
of
literature
contains
remarkably
few
studies
of
how
people
learn
to
train
test
improve
and
deploy
machine

systems
this
is
especially
true
of
the
k-12
curriculum
space
this
article
charts
the
emerging
trajectories
in
educational
practice
theory
and
technology
related
to
teaching
machine

in
k-12
education
the
article
situates
the
existing
work
in
the
context
of
computing
education
in
general
and
describes
some
differences
that
k-12
computing
educators
should
take
into
account
when
facing
this
challenge
the
article
focuses
on
key
aspects
of
the
paradigm
shift
that
will
be
required
in
order
to
successfully
integrate
machine
learning
into
the
broader
k-12
computing
curricula
a
crucial
step
is
abandoning
the
belief
that
rule-based
“traditional”
programming
is
a
central
aspect
and
building
block
in
developing
next
generation
computational
thinking
learning
to
program
at
an
early
age
has
been
shown
to
be
a
vehicle
for
the
development
of
computational
thinking
game-based
environments
are
often
used
to
develop
these
skills
but
they
lack
sufficient
voluntariness
to
assess
aspects
related
to
intrinsic
motivation
such
as
interests
skills
persistence
in
solving
a
problem
and
behavior
in
response
to

these
aspects
directly
affect
achievement
and
academic
performance
so
it
is
necessary
to
analyze
possible
age
and
gender
differences
in
order
to
adjust
computational
thinking
curricula
with
this
aim
we
deployed
a
voluntary
video
game
which
addresses
basic
computational_concepts
based
on
intrinsic
motivation
and
aimed
at
early
ages
data
were
collected
and
analyzed
using
game
learning
analytics
for
15
months
during
which
4124
users
played
more
than
28187
games
the
analysis
shows
significant
age
and
gender
differences
in
relation
to
interests
skills
achievement
and
progression
through
attempts
it
was
observed
that
the
concepts
addressed
were
achievable
between
the
ages
of
3
and
6
years
and
full
mastery
was
possible
by
the
age
of
4
years
regardless
of
gender
as
children
persist
with
the
challenge
intrinsically
motivated
until
it
is
overcome
in
terms
of
persistence
significantly
different
behaviors
were
observed
in
the
face
of
the
challenge
which
can
help
us
to
adjust
the
different
learning
methodologies
to
each
age
group
and
gender
adapting
the
way
we
provide
reinforcement
and
rewards
especially
for
boys
in
the
more
complex
challenges
and
for
girls
from
the
age
of
5
years
onwards
computational
thinking
is
a
key
universal
competence
often
taught
using
methods
specific
to
computer
science
one
step
towards
achieving
it
is
learning
to
analyse
and
create
algorithms
researchers
have
long
been
trying
to
establish
how
the
form
of
representation
of
algorithms
pseudocode
versus
flowchart
affects
its
understanding
and
have
reached
varying
sometimes
conflicting
results
this
article
presents
findings
that
provide
objective
new
data
on
this
topic
in
our
experiment
we
used
two
different
types
of
algorithmic
tasks
with
three
levels
of
complexity
and
a
group
of
114
research
participants
with
varying
programming
skills
in
addition
we
used
an
eye
tracking
technique
that
allowed
us
to
collect
detailed
information
about
the
subjects’
attention
distribution
during
analysis
of
algorithms
our
results
show
that
subjects
took
significantly
less
time
to
analyse
flowcharts
than
they
did
with
pseudocode
made
much
fewer
errors
and
had
higher
confidence
in
the
correctness
of
their
solution
based
on
eye
tracking
data
a
reduced
number
of
both
re-analyses
of
the
algorithm
and
input
data
re-referencing
was
observed
for
graphically
presented
tasks
the
difference
in
favour
of
flowcharts
was
revealed
with
few
exceptions
for
all
levels
of
algorithm
complexity
simple
medium
complex
while
regarding
the
duration
of
analysis
the
advantage
of
flowcharts
increased
with
the
growing
complexity
of
algorithms
for
complex
algorithms
a
significant
relationship
was
observed
between
algorithm
presentation
and
level
of
programming
skills
versus
the
duration
of
task
solving
and
confidence
level
our
study
strongly
supports
the
idea
of
using
graphic
representation
of
algorithms
both
when
learning
to

and
in
acquiring

the
current
covid-19
crisis
has
created
significant
challenges
for
schools
the
growing
importance
of
“flipping
the
classroom”
and
the
needful
emphasizing
of
online-learning
were
owed
to
the
situation
to
meet
these
requirements
materials
and
tasks
must
be
adapted
the
open
educational
resource
oer
textbook
“computational
thinking
with
the
bbc
microbit”
was
developed
for
the
introduction
of
computational
thinking
ct
for
10-14-year-old
pupils
in
austrias
secondary
schools
example
tasks
in
the
textbook
are
designed
with
an
open
end
and
present
extensions
with
ideas
for
further
development
instead
of
ending
abruptly
this
article
provides
a
guideline
for
a
clear
distinction
in
redesigning
existing
lessons
following
the
inverted
classroom
model
icm
using
videos
for
pre-class
work
and
live
task
extensions
for
in-class
work
which
parts
in
the
learning
design
must
remain
as
live
lessons
and
which
parts
can
be
adapted
for
video
lessons
the
respective
research
shows
that
examples
that
have
a
makerspace
activity
as
an
extension
are
especially
helpful
for
an
efficient
determination
of
the
appropriate
part
in
the
learning
design
and
particularly
suitable
for
an
adaptation
with
icm
the
central
advantage
of
the
icm
is
that
it
responds
flexibly
to
the
individual
learning
needs
of
each
student
it
allows
students
to
take
their
time
reviewing
the
material
at
their
own
pace
without
getting
left
behind
the
textbook
used
here
encourages
pupils
to
find
their
own
solutions
by
explorative
learning
using
the
block-based
programming
environment
makecode
additional
information
to
be
uncovered
by
the
learner
is
provided
for
every
single
step
in
the
accompanying
online
wiki
website
results
from
observations
showed
that
this
uncover-function
being
a
central
element
of
the
online
material
encouraged
the
learners
to
explore
their
own
way
in
finding
a
solution
with
playful
elements
and
increased
motivation
the
many
haptic
elements
of
a
makerspace
activity
are
in
particular
useful
for
consolidation
of
the
learned
and
are
predisposed
for
in-class
work
and
deepening
the
understanding
following
the
constructionism
theory
a
design-based

dbr
approach
is
used
to
create
and

in
a
pilot
project
teachers
who
are
already
familiar
with
the

and
the
oer
textbook
were
trained
on
how
to
use
the
“flip-version”
of
an
example
task
in
their
lessons
and
asked
to
develop
a
lesson
plan
for
implementation
the
didactic
approach
to
redesigning
the
material
and
teacher
training
was
evaluated
during
the
first
cycle
of
dbr
results
from
expert
interviews
showed
that
the
redesigned
material
and
training
deliver
a
solid
ground
for
rework
and
further
research
on
a
larger
scale
as
an
important
course
in
computer

the

the
role
of

in

this

proposes
to
use

to
develop
an

and
we
provide

through
these
reforms
we
found
that
students

have
been
improved
the
quality
of

the
cultivation
of
computational

are
improved
in

the
interest
in
introducing

has
increased
emphasizing
the
importance
of
promoting
computational

are
intended
to
facilitate

reports
on
a

of
the

that
form
the
basis
of
the

of
the
overall

data
were
collected
by
interviewing
seven
experts
who

the
resulting
six
preliminary

describe
the
first
insight
into
the
design
of
robotics-based

while
block-based
programming
has
successfully
eliminated
critical
syntactic
barriers
to
programming
it
remains
unclear
how
effectively
it
aids
in
overcoming
semantic
logical
and
pragmatic
programming
challenges
that
hinder
computational
thinking
these
challenges
are
likely
to
far
outweigh
the
syntactic
ones
with
the
goal
of
creating
a
highly
accessible
programming
tool
for
young
students
using
mobile
devices
we
explored
the
concept
of
pragmatic
prebugging
to
begin
addressing
these
challenges
by
pragmatic
prebugging
we
refer
to
proactive
debugging
tools
designed
to
prevent
logical
errors
this
article
introduces
rulergame
as
a
computational
thinking
tool
with
built-in
pragmatic
prebugging
enabling
novice
programmers
to
create
games
through
a
paradigm
we
call
proxy-based

statistically
significant

of
proxy-based

compared
to

in
this
study
the
pair
computational
problem-solving
between
the
student
and
chatgpt
was
analyzed
the
three
university
students
who
were
experienced
in
using
python
program
in
computational
problem-solving
participated
in
the
study
in
data
collection
a
problem
involving
“limit

sequence”
from
calculus
was
used
to
examine
students
collaboration
with
chatgpt
students
were
asked
to
construct
a
program
that
produces
a
solution
to
this
problem
in
python
and
meanwhile
it
was
stated
that
they
could
work
in
pairs
with
chatgpt
the
responses
provided
by
chatgpt
to
the
students
in
the
computational
problem-solving
were
evaluated
in
both
computational
and
mathematical
contexts
and
a
list
of
cases
in
which
chatgpt
could
and
could
not
support
students
in
the
computational
thinking
practices
was
created
aside
from
the
incorrect
or
implicit
answers
provided
by
chatgpt
in
general
it
was
determined
that
chatgpt
supported
the
students
performance
in
computational
thinking
it
was
deduced
that
it
was
important
for
the
student
to
make
a
rational
problem-solving
plan
and
to
guide
the
chatgpt
with
the
appropriate
prompts
in
order
to
use
rational
questioning
that
leads
to
productive
argumentation
with
chatgpt
advances
in
computer

have
expanded
our
capacity
to
solve

never
imagined
using

plays
a
central
role
in
computer

classes
whereby
the

to
be
analyzed
are
often
already
available

the
initial
process
where
the

have
to
parse

using
adequate

has
hardly
been
considered
systematically
so
far
however
encoding

is
essential
for
the
understanding
of
sign

and
for

this
paper
therefore
presents
the
development
and
evaluation
of
a
teaching

called
“cup

designed
to
model

using
a
percussion

it
simultaneously
imparts
coding

concepts
and
fosters
computational

as
a

in
this

we
propose
a
novel
robot-mediated
collaborative

activity
for
school
children
called
justhink
aiming
at
improving
their
computational

for

can
influence
the

we
carried

in
switzerland
in
which
around
100
children
participated
in
pairs
in
one-hour
long

surprisingly
we
observe
that
while

significantly
affects
how

it
does
not

helps
closing
the
gap
between

in
this
paper
we
analyze
how
to
introduce
online
adaptive
formative
learning
in
computer
science
a
discipline
with
well
documented
challenges
that
are
hard
to
tackle
with
traditional
classroom
methods
specifically
we
developed
illustrative
learning
items
teaching
model-driven
design
and
implemented
them
in
an
online
system
that
implements
a
model
for
automatic
formative
assessment
developed
by
university
of
torino
the
model
takes
advantage
of
an
automatic
assessment
system
initially
designed
for
stem
disciplines
then
adopted
for
teaching
languages
and
other
disciplines
too
the
key
features
of
the
adaptive
model
supported
by
the
online
system
are
algorithmic
questions
availability
contextualization
immediate
feedback
interactive
feedback
and
open
answers
these
features
are
portable
across
subject
domains
so
the
system
can
be
adapted
to
include
new
subjects
we
chose
mdd
because
it
is
a
topic
of
computer
science
education
connected
with
computational
thinking
software
design
and
formal
methods
which
are
three
of
the
core
areas
in
need
of
enhanced
support
the
rise
of
the
industrial
revolution
40
and
the
increasing
reliance
on
the
digital
economy
drive
the
need
for
a
new
set
of
skills
especially
in
robotics
learning
that
includes
computational
thinking
ct
and
adversarial
thinking
at
for
the
young
generation
the
need
for
ct-related
skills
includes
various
fields
such
as
robotics
engineering
computer
science
mathematics
music
arts
and
humanities
therefore
adopting
robotic
learning
with
ct
and
at
can
enhance
learning
skills
over
the
conventional
learning
model
this
paper
presents
a
systematic
literature
review
on
ct
and
at
practices
in
robotics
learning
to
improve
educational

this

conducts
a
systematic

sixty-five
studies
in
robotics
learning
to
increase
ct

were
analyzed
by
applying
the
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
the
study’s
findings
show
that
ct
and
at
are
significant
in
training
students
to
engage
in
robotics
learning
activities
these
considerations
will
lead
to
strengthening
their

and
critical_thinking
the
study
also
suggests
that
integrating
these
skills
can
prepare
teachers
for
critical_thinking
and
boost
student
learning
the
findings
suggest
that
ct
and
at
can
directly
adopt
digital
adversarial

to
improve
overall
robotics

perspective
at
a
technological
level
we
differentiate
two
main
tools
sucrecore
andsucrecode
sucrecore
provides
a

sucre4stem
makes
it
easier
to
implement
new
group

and
to
create
novel
types
of
collaborative
projects
between
groups
of

in
this
article
we
also
explore
how
these
collaborative
projects
can
be
carried
out
by
taking
advantage
of
the
different
types
of
communications
between
sucrecore
and
the

scratch
enables
children
to
learn
about

by
creating
games
and
animations
and
is
currently
one
of
the
most
popular
introductory
programming
languages
while
scratch
has
been
found
to
increase
students
motivation
and
interest
in
programming
it
has
been
debated
whether
scratch
users
practice
and
learn
about
core
programming
concepts
such
as
loops
conditional
expressions

and
variables
this
paper
presents
a
large

study
of
the
progression
of
the
programming
concepts
practiced
by
scratch
users
through
an
analysis
of
their
complete
public
project
portfolios
a
dataset
of
over
112
thousand
authors
and
their
1
million
projects
was
constructed
and
analyzed
from
three
viewpoints
first
we
investigate
the
development
of
programming
concepts
by
looking
at
block
usage
statistics
for
each
project
in
the
users
repositories
second
we
score
and
analyze
the
dataset
using
a
computational

rubric
third
we
identify
users
that
have
left
the
scratch
platform
and
evaluate
the
learning
goals
they
have
achieved
our
results
show
that
while
users
progress
in
scratch
there
is
a
positive
trend
in
the
use
of
all
concepts
that
were
examined
within
the
least
utilized
concepts
even
after
the
20th
project
of
scratch
users
are

and
logic
operations
examining
the
users
who
have
left
the
scratch
platform
after
creating
at
least
the
mean
amount
of
nine
projects
we
measured
that
half
had

produced
the
hypothesis
is
that

and
the
management

commonly
utilized
by

the
fundamental
concept
behind
bayes’
theorem
revolves
around
comprehending
the
degree
of
truth
within
the
confines
of
an
explicit
perspective
this
involves
partitioning
the
entire
sample
space
of

and
utilizing
the
subset
containing
the
relevant
perspective
to
estimate
the
uncertainty
of
an

or
the
reliability
of
a
model
however
it
is
often
found
difficult
for

to
understand
bayes’
theorem
to
the
level
of
applying
it
to

introduces
an
innovative

undergraduate
course
to
aid
the
understanding
of
complex

and
enhance

computational
thinking
skills
research
indicates
that
students
irrespective
of
their
educational
level
face
difficulties
in
grasping
fundamental
concepts
in
mechanics
of
materials
these
challenges
arise
from
the
inherent
complexity
of
concepts
like
stress
strain
torsion
and
buckling
which
are
difficult
to
observe
hindering
comprehension
therefore
this
work
aims
to
leverage
the
synergy
between
mechanics
of
materials
and
computational
principles
to
actively
engage
students
in
advanced
topics
such
as
structural
strength
failure
of
structures
and
sensitivity
analysis
through
the
use
of
computational
notebooks
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
this
approach
we
first
asked
students
to
analyze
truss
structures
using
hand
calculations
following
the
discrete
stiffness
method
within
a
finite
element
analysis
framework
subsequently
we
implemented
the
same
method
as
a
simulation
tool
in
a
matlab
computational
notebook
finally
we
asked
the
students
to
reflect
on
1
the
value
of
using
computational
methods
to
approach
finite
element
analysis
when
compared
to
hand
calculations
2
the
difficulties
they
faced
when
implementing
the
activities
in
the
matlab
computational
notebook
3
the
support
they
required
to
successfully
complete
these
activities
and
4
the
effectiveness
of
the
simulation
tool
in
understanding
the
effect
of
forces
and
stress
distributions
in
structures
we
anticipate
that
computational
notebooks
will
provide
an
ideal
platform
for
sharing
lessons
and
tutorials
enhancing
student
engagement
and
promoting
active
learning
students
have
access
to
the
complete
source
code
allowing
them
to
develop
computational

early
exposure
to
coding
modeling
and
simulation
techniques
is
crucial
in
preparing

for
the
computational
demands
of
modern

workplaces
data
mining
approaches
have
proven
to
be
successful
in
improving
learners’
interaction
with
educational
computer
games
despite
the
potential
of
predictive
modelling
in
providing
timely
adaptive
learning
and
gameplay
experience
there
is
a
lack
of
research
on
the
early
prediction
of
learners’
performance
in
educational
games
in
this
research
we
propose
an
early
predictive
modelling
approach
called
gameepm
to
estimate
learners’
final
scores
in
an
educational
game
for
promoting
computational
thinking
specifically
the
gameepm
approach
models
the
sequence
of
learners’
actions
and
then
uses
a
limited
sequence
of
the
actions
to
predict
the
final
score
of
the
game
for
each
learner
the
findings
from
our
initial
trials
show
that
our
approach
can
accurately
and
robustly
estimate
the
learners’
performance
at
the
early
stages
of
the
game
using
less
than
50
of
learners’
action
sequences
the
cross-validated
deep
learning
model
achieves
a
squared
correlation
higher
than
08
with
a
relative
error
of
less
than
8
outperforming
a
range
of
regression
models
like
linear
regression
random
forest
neural
networks
and
support
vector
machines
an
additional
experiment
showed
that
the
validated
deep
learning
model
can
also
achieve
high
performance
while
tested
on
an
independent
game
dataset
showing
its
applicability
and
robustness
in
real-world
cases
comparing
the
results
with
traditional
machine
learning
methods
revealed
that
in
the
validation
and
application
phases
up
to
030
and
035
r2
gain
is
achieved
in
favor
of
the
deep
learning
model
respectively
finally
we
found
that
while
the
lengths
of
action
sequences
influence
the
predictive
power
of
the
traditional
machine
learning
methods
this
effect
is
not
substantial
in
the
deep

to
determine
if
there
exists
a
statistically
significant
distinction
between
high_school

steam
creativity
particularly
within
the
realm
of
art
and
design
is
commonly
perceived
as
the
ability
to
think
beyond

boundaries
the
study
posited
an
alternative
perspective
by
equating
computational

a
total
of
forty-two
kids
from
a
high_school
in

teachers
face
challenges
in
teaching

the
difficulties
vary
from
subject
to
subject
teachers
first
challenge
in
computer
science
cs
and
computational

teaching
is
their
technological
literacy
and
competency
challenges
lack
of
confidence
time
and
willingness
are
significant
reasons
for
the
challenge
one
of
the
studies
on
mathematics
teaching
shows
that
teachers
need
more
knowledge
tools
and
models
to
facilitate
the
analysis
during
the
teaching
process
researchers
assert
that
educational
practice
has
focused
more
on
technology
than
on
new
pedagogies
needed
to
truly
use
technology
in
a
transformative
way
frameworks
are
designed
to
meet
high-level
objectives
set
by
the
authorities
teachers
are
provided
with
teaching
materials
for
developing
the
course
contents
the
frameworks
act
as
a
connection
between
high-level
objectives
and
low-level
teaching
materials
in
this
paper
we
present
the
elaboration
of
a
framework
for
teaching
cs
at
the
early
stages
of
education
the
framework
consists
of
three
components
based
on
modelling
real-world
problems
into
a
machine-world
context
and
then
realising
the
machine
solution
in
the
real
world
moreover
the
problem-solving
component
of
the
framework
emphasizes
the
iterative
process
of
learning
that
strengthens
the
previous
concepts
and
provides
a
logical
con-nection
between
the
previous
and
new
concepts
the
framework
was
evaluated
in
the
context
of
saudi
arabia
where
the
teachers
were
interviewed
individually
and
then
provided
with
a
guide
for
teaching
grade-4
learners
the
guide
was
developed
using
the
material
provided
by
the
saudi
ministry
of
education
the
teachers
taught
using
this
guide
over
a
sequence
of
lessons
at
the
end
of
this
time
a
second
individual
teacher
interview
was
conducted
to
determine
teacher
experience
the
results
show
that
teaching
using
the
framework
is
effective
and
it
is
not
only
easier
for
teachers
to
understand
the
teaching
method
but
also
for
learners
to
learn

there
is
a
need
to
increase
the
number
of
students
especially

we
need
innovative
approaches
in

to
better
engage

and
awake
their
interest
in
computer
science
this
paper
addresses
the
need
to
create
tools
that
effectively
support
the
learning
of
programming
and
the
development
of
computational
thinking
highlighting
why
video

can
be
an
effective
educational
tool
for

genre
that
has
not
been
frequently
used
before
to
address
the
teaching
of

we
consider
that
video

have
a
number
of
benefits
such
as
that
stimulate
active

are
engaging
for
a
wide
range
of

we
want
to
explore
this
kind
of
games
effectiveness
as
a

as
well
as
its
effect
on
the
perception
of

this
work-in-progress

paper
presents
the

fea
course
for
undergraduate
mechanical
engineering
students
our
previous
work
has
shown
that
students
often
face
difficulties
in
grasping
abstract
concepts
from
mechanics
of
materials
while
simultaneously
learning
computational
modeling
however
students
recognized
several
advantages
of
using
matlab
for
fea
compared
to
manual
calculations
including
significant
time
savings
increased
efficiency
and
reduced
errors
nevertheless
they
also
faced
challenges
including
a
steep
learning
curve
for
matlab
and
concerns
about
how
this
limitation
hinders
their
conceptual
understanding
despite
these
drawbacks
they
recognized
the
importance
and
value
of
developing
computational
skills
for
their
future
careers
in
this
study
we
extended
the
scaffolds
and
changed
the
sequence
of
activities
to
address
the
challenges
the
students
faced
in
the
previous
iteration
of
our
work
specifically
we
provided
worked
examples
that
students
needed
to
use
self-explain
and
modify
before
they
engaged
in
programming
from
scratch
also
after
developing
a
basic
understanding
of
how
to
implement
fea
in
matlab
the
students
used
chatgpt
to
generate
a
code
that
would
do
the
same
task
this
activity
required
them
to
evaluate
and
refine
automatically
generated
matlab
code
as
chatgpt
may
provide
alternative
solutions
that
might
not
always
work
correctly
we
explore
three
main
topics
to
understand
student
experiences
with
and
perceptions
of
this
approach
1
the
value
of
using
computational
methods
compared
to
manual
completion
for
fea
2
the
challenges
and
support
of
using
matlab
for
fea
and
3
the
effectiveness
of
simulation
tools
to
learn
fea
the
goal
of
this
project
is
two-fold
1
supporting
student
learning
of
intricate
phenomena
explored
in
mechanics
of
materials
like
distribution
of
stress
and
stiffness
and
2
fostering
essential
computational
thinking
skills
through
practical
disciplinary
coding
experience
by
implementing
these
elements
the
study
anticipates
a
substantial
improvement
in
students
understanding
of
fea
principles
and
their
ability
to
translate
them
into
solutions
for
real-world
engineering
challenges
teaching
autonomous
and
intelligent
transportation
systems
in
higher_education
has
traditionally
focused
on
theory
often
lacking
comprehensive
coverage
of
the
practical
techniques
required
for
real-world
applications
to
overcome
this
we
developed
a
new
university
course
centered
around
hands-on
learning
with
a
modular
autonomous
small-scale
vehicle
platform
called
f1tenth
this
paper
presents
a
detailed
overview
of
the
new
course
design
its
underlying
philosophy
the
individual
teaching
modules
and
the
modular
hardwaresoftware
of
the
f1tenth
platform
this
new
course
was
then
evaluated
with
a
survey
conducted
at
five
universities
that
have
adopted
the
teaching
modules
for
their
semester-long
undergraduate
and
graduate
courses
the
results
show
that
approximately
80
of
all
involved
students
strongly
agree
that
the
hardware
platform
and
modules
significantly
increased
their
motivation
to
learn
more
than
70
of
the
students
agreed
that
the
hardware
enhanced
their
understanding
of
the
material
the
findings
demonstrate
that
our
course
setup
and
the
f1tenth
hardware
effectively
combine
theoretical
knowledge
with
practical
application
greatly
enhancing
the
educational
outcomes
and
the
students
computational

explore
the
long-term

numerous
initiatives
have
been
developed
to
lower
down
the

teaching
approach
for
k-12
programming
courses
with
the
purpose
of
providing
practical
insights
for
the

a
python-based
lab
activity
was
developed
for
a
remote
thermodynamics
course
to
add
computational
thinking
to
traditional
analytical
problem_solving
python
was
selected
to
conduct
the
analysis
because
of
its
popularity
and
utility
in
the
broader

early
exposure
to
this
highly
desired
engineering
skill
can
provide
added

combining
python
with
an
engaging
lab
experience
can
have
a
compounding
effect
on

learning
outcomes
a
five-week
python-based
lab
module
was
developed
for
an
introductory
thermal-fluid
science
class
the
module
reinforced
fundamental
concepts
learned
in
lecture
while
expanding
on
design-related
analysis
which
is
often
left
for
advanced
courses
the
lab
module
began
with
an
introduction
to
python
programming
and
quickly
transitioned
to
the
parametric
analysis
of
standard
rankine
gas

results
indicate
a
strong
positive
impact
on
python
programming
learning
outcomes
students
acquired
a
working
knowledge
of
python
programming
and
experienced
how
computational
tools
can
be
used
to
solve
advanced
engineering
problems
at
the

even
if
they
are
aware
of
their
relevance
and
benefits
to
their
future
careers
nevertheless
the
positive

in
this
research
coding

are
used
as
a
part
of
the
teaching

and
the
assessment
tools
are
used
to
assess
the
algorithmic_thinking
ability
of
the
students
the
assumption
here
is
that
there
is
a
mutual
impact
between
the
improvement
of
teaching
materials
and
that
of
assessment
tools
this
kind
of
strategy
is
important
especially
in
the
setting
of
elementary_school
education
in
japan
in
which
conducting
a
pilot
study
is
difficult
in
japan
the
new
curriculum
guidelines
were
fully
implemented
in
april
2020
in
elementary
schools
and
in
april
2021
in
junior
high
schools
respectively
they
will
be
implemented
in
april
2022
in
high
schools
since
the
announcement
of
the
new
curriculum
guidelines
the
boards
of
education
in
the
local
governments
have
been
preparing
for
the
programming
education
in
the
schools
however
there
are
still
remaining
problems
including
the
shortage
of
trained
teachers
and
the
lack
of
good
assessment
tools
in
order
to
remedy
the
shortage
of
trained
teachers
we
designed
some
coding
sheets
for
the
teaching
materials
consisting
of
block
parts
servo
motors
dc-motors
leds
and
sensors
in
our
assessment
tools
which
are
supposed
to
assess
students
computational
thinking
ability
we
included
only
the
questions
for
assessing
algorithmic_thinking
ability
as
there
is
a
limited
amount
of
time
for
the
assessment
in
schools
we
have
used
our
teaching
materials
and
our
assessment
tools
in
some
elementary
schools
based
on
the
results
of
the
teaching
activities
we
discuss
the
strategy
to
improve

together
automatic
assessment
of
learner
competencies
is
a
fundamental
task
in
intelligent
tutoring
systems
an
assessment
rubric
typically
and
effectively
describes
relevant
competencies
and
competence
levels
this
paper
presents
an
approach
to
deriving
a
learner
model
directly
from
an
assessment
rubric
defining
some
partial
ordering
of
competence
levels
the
model
is
based
on
bayesian
networks
and
exploits
logical
gates
with
uncertainty
often
referred
to
as
noisy
gates
to
reduce
the
number
of
parameters
of
the
model
so
to
simplify
their
elicitation
by
experts
and
allow
real-time
inference
in
intelligent
tutoring
systems
we
illustrate
how
the
approach
can
be
applied
to
automatize
the
human
assessment
of
an
activity
developed
for
testing
computational
thinking
skills
the
simple
elicitation
of
the
model
starting
from
the
assessment
rubric
opens
up
the
possibility
of
quickly
automating
the
assessment
of
several
tasks
making
them
more
easily
exploitable
in
the
context
of
adaptive
assessment
tools
and
intelligent
tntorino
systems
our
study
is
set
in
an
educational
context
to
better
teach
and
assess
21st-century
skills
such
as
computational
thinking
or
creative
problem_solving
we
propose
to
formalize
a
specific
activity
that
involves
these
competencies
this
activity
referred
to
as
creacube
is
presented
as
an
open-ended

which
consists
of
assembling
a

into
an

we
not
only
anchor
our
formalization
in
classical
learning
science
frameworks
but
we
also
propose
to
draw
on
neuro-cognitive
models
to
describe
the
observed
behaviors
of
learners
engaged
in
this
activity
the
chosen
formalism
is
symbolic
and
is
aligned
on
upper
ontologies
to
ensure
that
the
vocabulary
is
well
specified
this
allows
for
a
better
communication
between
the
summoned
research
fields
namely
learning
science
cognitive
neuroscience
and
computational
modeling
beyond
this
specification
purpose
we
suggest
performing
inferences
using
available
reasoners
to
better
guide
the
analysis
of
the

collected
during
the

this
operationalization
of
a
creative
problem-solving
activity
is
part
of
an
exploratory

action
in

an
effective
proof
of

is
described
in
this

understanding
computing
concepts
is
one
of
the
foundational
elements
of
computational
thinking
which
helps
students
formulate
logic
and
algorithms
for
effectively
developing
and
designing
codes
however
novice
learners
often
struggle
to
understand
basic
computing
concepts
such
as
variables
loops
arrays
conditionals
and
functions
this
is
often
caused
by
the
invisibility
of
the
computing
mechanism
and
the
complexity
of
language
syntax
and
conventions
moreover
challenges
in
learning
computing
concepts
can
be
compounded
for
learners
with
atypical
conditions
eg
visual
cognitive
and
learning
impairment
attention
deficit
and
neurodivergence
to
tackle
this
teachers
of

learners
frequently
use
notional

-
simplified
representations
eg
diagrams
flow
charts
and
analogies
created
to
assist
novice
programmers
in
understanding
abstract
concepts
program
execution
and
dynamics
in
addition
traditional
learning
activities
may
need
assistive
learning
interventions
alis
and
learner-oriented
practices
like
physical
tactile
models
computing
artifacts
and
interactive
learning
tools
nm
approaches
tend
to
focus
on
the
explanation
of
concepts
from
instructor
to
learner
while
alis
tend
to
focus
on
learner
support
in
activities
both
methods
can
provide
advantages
for
learning
and
we
expect
that
a
combined
approach
would
provide
even
greater
synergy
for
all
learners
however
little
consideration
has
been
given
to
how
nm
and

approaches
could
be
effectively
combined
this

investigates
how
nm

can
be
effectively
brought
together
more
holistically
as

we
also

of

reasonable
evaluation
can
help

better
at

it
can
also
provide
a

most
of
the
existing

on

are
carried
from
three
perspectives
computational

ct
ability
visual

aesthetics
and
code
quality
among
them
the
assessment
of
ct
and
code
quality
is
mainly
carried
out
from
the

script
while
the
evaluation
of
visual
aesthetics
is
analyzed
from
the
perspective
of
image
sequences
generated
by
project
execution
the
single-view
evaluation
focuses
on
the
performance
of
a
program
in
a
certain
aspect
and
is
one-sided
in
this
paper
we
propose
a
multi-view
evaluation
framework
to
integrate
various

using
different

we
quantitatively
analyze
the
assessment
of
different

driven
by

combined
with
overall

that
represent
human
opinions
we
analyze
their
differences
and

through

we
determine
the
weights
of
different
integration
policies
the
proposed
multi-view

method
can
generate
evaluation
results
similar
to

so
it
is
crucial
to
develop

no

so
new

in
this

a
novel

dso
is
proposed
the
deep

mimics
the

employed
in
this

the
mathematical
model
of

is
employed
to

the
performance
of

the

to
address

are
identified
the

that
helps
to
understand
the

a

inter

it

then
essential
to

this
can

on
the
motivation
of

from
the
perspective
of

in
particular
significant
dependencies
between
the

and
individual
subcategories
of
the
intrinsic

inventory
could
be
demonstrated
the
generalization
of
the
research
results
is
limited
due
to
the
small
sample
size
and
the
exclusive
participation
of

stem
learning
from

is
essential
to
confirm
that

inherit
currently
there
are
incredible
and
inexpensive

this
platform
attempts
to
visualize
their

makes
a

the
platform
has
applied
in

platteville
and
the
results
show
the
benefit
of
utilizing

as
follows
i
transforms
abstract

ii
delivers
an
entertaining
and

environment
iii
combines
stem
theory
with

and
iv
provides
a
hand-on

which
is

teachers
with
the

necessary
to
teach
cs
to
build

districts
must
provide

that
includes
not

but
also
high-quality
pedagogical
approaches
that
will
meet
the
needs
of
all

enrolled
in

settings
in
this
paper
we
explore
teacher
outcomes
across
multiple
cs
professional

opportunities
in
one
large

the
teacher
outcomes
were
measured
via
a
survey
administered
between
eight
months
and
two
years
after
teachers
received
training
to
implement
cs
though
our
findings
are
from
a
single
district
we
believe
these
findings
are
relevant
to
other
settings
and
provide
useful
information
about
the
outcomes
of
teacher
professional
development
for
cs
education
as
well
as
supports
and
barriers
to
implementing
cs
in
a

system
the
results
offer
insight
into

confidence
the
ability
of

to
implement

in
their
classrooms
and
supports
and
barriers
to
offering

instruction
even
in
a
district
where
cs
education
is
a

they
also
shed
light
on
how

differ
in

compared
with

these

underscore
the
importance
of

debugging
code
is
a
central
skill
in
learning
to

nevertheless
debugging
poses
a
major
hurdle
in
the
k12
classroom
as
students
are
often
rather
helpless
and
rely
on
the
teacher
hurrying
from
one
student-pc
to
the
other
despite
this
debugging
is
an
underrepresented
topic
in
the

as
only
few

have
to
take

students
preexisting
debugging
experience
is
built
through
troubleshooting
where
they
frequently
find
and
fix
errors
in
their
daily
lives
-
before
they
learn
to
program
-
for
example
when
repairing
their
bicycle
or
if
“the

stops
working
debugging
is
a
special
case
of
general
troubleshooting
and
shares
common
characteristics
such
as
the
overall

thus
the
aim
of

is
to
develop
an
instrument
for
assessing
preexisting
debugging
experience
in
the
form
of
a
real-world

troubleshooting
tasks
this
allows
us
to
observe
students
troubleshooting

strategies
and
overall
behavior
in
a
natural

and
thus
assess
preexisting
debugging
experience
to
this
end
a
design-based
research
process
was
conducted
and
a
real-world
escape
room
consisting
of
various
troubleshooting
tasks
was
developed
those
tasks
and
the

provide
an
innovative

the
main
innovation
of

computational

ct
is
an
important
and
essential
skill
for
human
beings
to
master
in
the
21st
century
although
ct
has
received
wide
attention
since
this
concept
was
proposed
the
current
theoretical
models
have
not
well
defined
the
complex
relations
between
ct
and
other
cognitive
abilities
for
young
children
to
provide
insight
into
this
gap
the
current
study
proposed
a
model
in
which
we
hypothesized
that
ct
was
significantly
related
to
arithmetic
fluency
that
is
viewed
as
an
important
domain
of
mathematics
additionally
arithmetic
fluency
was
predicted
to
mediate
the
relations
of
ct
to
other
cognitive
abilities
including
reasoning
and
creativity
this
study
tested
such
direct
and
indirect
relations
in
children
aged
5–6
years
consistent
with
previous
studies
on
older
age
groups
the
results
showed
that
ct
and
arithmetic
fluency
were
significantly
related
to
each
other
and
both
were
significantly
related
to
reasoning
ability
and
creative
thinking
as
well
moreover
this
study
for
the
first
time
indicated
that
arithmetic
fluency
totally
mediated
the
relation
between
ct
and
reasoning
ability
suggesting
that
these
concepts
share
conceptual
commonalities
such
as
the
cognitive
processes
related
to
mathematics
orand
abstraction
in
contrast
arithmetic
fluency
did
not
mediate
the
relation
between
ct
and
creative
thinking
suggesting
that
gaining
ct
skill
may
exert
direct
positive
effect
on
the
development
of
creativity
therefore
despite
the
root
in
computer
science
ct
is
associated
with
many
cognitive
and
learning
abilities
in
other
domains
supporting
the
importance
of
including
ct
into

school
education
computational

ct

critical
for

ensuring
equitable

that

moderated
their

early
evidence
suggests
that
robot
programming
offers
an
important
foundation
for
spatial
reasoning
and
computational
thinking
however
researchers
have
debated
how
to
introduce
young
children
to
these
skills
we
explored
how
preschoolers
develop
understanding
of
spatial
concepts
and
computational
thinking
as
the
children
took
turns
navigating
a
path
during
guided
play
with
a

our
analysis
of
the
data
included
a
multimodal
visualization
of
the
exchanges
between
the
teacher
children
and
a

robotic
device
the
findings
highlight
the
effects
that
arose
from
the
physical-digital
convergence
of
technology
integrated
into

including
a
the
robot
evoked
a
chain
of
actions
enacting
pedagogic
forces
that
transformed
childrens
learning
b
children
used
their
own
bodies
as
spatial
referents
co-locating
themselves
in

with
the

c
the
teacher
remained
a
key
actor
providing
verbal
and
nonverbal
scaffolding
to
promote
childrens
understanding

mastery
of
spatial
and
computational_concepts
and
d
talking
with
the
teacher
about
spatial
concepts
combined
with
the
interactions
with
the

enhanced
childrens
acquisition

play
a

and
thus
constitute
a
critical
component
in

in
this

computational

constitutes
an
important

to
have
as
it
enables

nonetheless
across

there

in

to
reduce

gap

a
pertinent
and

question
that
arises
is
whether

existing

our
study
designed
a
program
with
tailored
animations
and

to
specifically
foster

learning
and
cognitive
development
using
a
mixed-methods
approach
we
administered

to
investigate
a

additionally
semi-structured

were
conducted
with
15
students
to
further
probe
insights
quantitative
findings
revealed
a
mutually

relationship
in
the

suggesting
that
higher

complementing
these
results
qualitative
findings
showed
that
integrating

significantly
boosted
students
srl
and
cognitive

these
findings
have
significant
implications
for
educational

schools
should
consider
implementing

strategies
such
as
proactive

to
promote

furthermore
strategic
investments
in

are
essential
to
create

provide
valuable
guidance
for
creating
a

in
primary_school
education
in
recent
years
there
has
been
increasing
interest
in
integrating
computational

ct
into
elementary
schools
however
few
studies
have
focused
on
teachers’
perceptions
this
study
aims
to
examine
teachers
perceptions
to
bridge
the
gap
between
theory
and
practice
the
study
analysed
teachers’
perceptions
of
integrating
ct
into
school
subjects
through
the
constructionist
approach
using
scratch
a
leading
programming
platform
inspired
by
resnicks
lifelong
kindergarten
constructionist
model
over
a
school
year
31
teachers
participated
in
a
professional
development
program
and
applied
this
model
in
their
classrooms
the
teachers
were
interviewed
to
capture
their
perceptions
of
learning
and
teaching
using
a
constructionist
method
the
findings
revealed
that
teachers
with
creative
arts
experience
fully
embraced
the
model
while
others
partially
adopted
it
teachers
recognized
the
benefits
of
constructionist
teaching
in
fostering
creativity
motivation
and
engagement
among
students
however
they
struggled
with
balancing
these
benefits
with
school
demands
and
constraints
challenges
included
managing
time
effectively
within
constraints
of
school
and
ensuring
curriculum
alignment
despite
this
many
teachers
found
that
the
constructionist
approach
positively
impacted
students
learning
engagement
and
personal
development
by
addressing
the
identified
challenges
teacher
education
designers
curriculum
developers
and
schools
can
develop
practices
for
closing
the
gap
between
theory
and
practice
in
the
field
of
education
research
has
consistently
emphasized
mathematical
creative
thinking
as
a
crucial
component
of
21st-century
skills
thus
this
cross-sectional
study
examines
the
predictors
of
such
thinking
by
specifically
focusing
on
the
roles
of
perceived
creativity
creative
self-efficacy

modeling
was
employed
demonstrating
satisfactory
construct
validity
and
instrument
reliability
based
on
the
results
there
was
a
positive
association
between
computational

and
mathematical
creative

in
addition
perceived
creativity
had
a
positive
impact
on
mathematical
creative
thinking
whereas
creative
self-efficacy
showed
a
negative
association
as
for
the
empirical
model
it
revealed
that
computational
thinking
plays
a
mediating
role
connecting
perceived
creativity
and
creative
self-efficacy
to
mathematical
creative
thinking
the
findings
suggest
that
incorporating
these
skills
and
related
variables
into
the
mathematics
curriculums
in
schools
is
essential
for
preparing
students
for
success
in
the
21st
century
previous
studies
have
explored
the
relationship
between
computational

ct
and
creativity
however
a
consensus
has
yet
to
be
reached
since
both
ct
and
creativity
varied
in
ideation
and
assessment
to
uncover
the
cognitive
mechanism
underlying
the
interplay
between
ct
and
creativity
we
conduct
a
scoping
review
of
26
empirical
studies
published
in
2006–2024
our
findings
suggested
that
the
effects
of
working
memory
varied
in
the
interplay
between
ct
and
creativity
due
to
differences
in
age
range
neural
network
activation

and
measurements
intellectual
abilities
including
algorithmic
fluency
reasoning
ability
and
coding
ability
showed
cognitive
transfer
effect
on
ct
skills
but
not
necessarily
on
creativity
suggesting
that
cognitive
abilities
embracing
more
intelligent
elements
may
contribute
to
the
functional
connectivity
in
ct
neural
networks
but
only
partly
overlapped
with

involved
networks
although
executive
functions
working
memory
cognitive
flexibility
and
inhibitory
control
play
a
crucial
role
in
both
ct
and
creativity
their
contributions
to
the
ct-creativity
interplay
are
still
rarely
studied
future
research
should
explore
the
ct-creativity

there
is
a
consensus
to
develop

however
the
choice
of

aimed
to
explore
the
differences
between
unplugged

1-2
students
it
also
explored
the
joint
effects
of
students’
gender
programming
experience
programming
interest
and

the
results
found
that
unplugged

more
in
the
early
primary

we
found
that
boys

group
performed
significantly
better
in

moreover
the
improvement
of

was
positively
correlated
with

practices
computational
thinking
education
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
topic
among
practitioners
and
researchers
however
rare
is
known
how
to
effectively
teach
and
learn
computational
thinking
in
early_childhood_education
to
address
this
knowledge
gap
this
systematic
review
examined
26
studies
on
the
teaching
and
learning
of
computational
thinking
in
early_childhood_education
from
2010
to
2022
the
content
knowledge
tools
pedagogical
design
assessment
methods
and
learning
outcomes
were
analyzed
results
indicated
that
with
age-appropriate
instructional
design
children
could
develop
early
concepts
and
skills
of
computational
thinking
as
well
as
other
related
skills
such
as
communication
collaboration
and
problem_solving
across
the
studies
we
found
that
most
studies
used
quantitative
research
methods
with
direct
assessment
and
observation
being
the
most
several
challenges
were
identified
1
achieving
a
deeper
learning
of
computational
thinking
2
a
lack
of
valid
and
reliable
computational
thinking
assessments
for
children
with
a
wider
age
range
3
selecting
appropriate
learning
tools
and
4
designing
age-appropriate
activities
for
young
learners
although
with
these
challenges
computational
thinking
education
could
bring
new
learning
opportunities
and
enhance
childrens
computational
thinking
skills
as
well
as
other
non-cognitive
skills
such
as
critical_thinking
body-material
interaction
and
hand-eye
coordination
this
systematic
review
informs
future
endeavors
in
theorizing
a
digital
learning
framework
that
can
integrate
computational
thinking
into
early_childhood_education
teacher
competencies
encompass
the
dimensions
of
knowledge
and
attitudes
yet
few
studies
have
analysed
teachers
latent
profiles
in
relation
to
the
interaction
between
these
two
dimensions
latent
profile
analysis
which
examines
the
interplay
between
variables
to
distinguish
subgroups
of
individuals
has
recently
emerged
in
studies
of
computational
thinking
ct
as
a
method
for
identifying
student
profiles
however
the
latent
profiles
of
ct
teachers
have
not
yet
been
analysed
we
therefore
analysed
the
latent
profiles
of
a
sample
of
493
teachers
who
had
participated
in
a
teacher
development
programme
in
ct
according
to
their
knowledge
and
perceived
usefulness
of
ct
three
profiles
were
identified
1
highly
knowledgeable
with
high
perceived
usefulness
2
knowledgeable
with
low
perceived
usefulness
and
3
less
knowledgeable
with
low
perceived
usefulness
qualitative
data
further
triangulated
these
findings
we
also
examined
the
learning
achievement
of
12105
students
taught
by
these
teachers
students
taught
by
highly
knowledgeable
teachers
with
a
high
perceived
sense
of
usefulness
demonstrated
significantly
better
achievement
than
their
peers
our
findings
highlight
the
importance
of
nurturing
both
knowledge
of
and
perceived
usefulness
in
ct
they
also
provide
valuable
insights
for
similar
teacher
development
programmes
emphasizing
the
importance
of
peer
mentoring
support
for
less
knowledgeable
teachers
additionally
we
underscore
the
value
of
having
teachers
create
artefacts
using
ct
for
instructional
purposes
allowing
them
to
gain
firsthand
experience
of
its
usefulness
as
few
studies
have
explored
teachers
latent
profiles
based
on
the
dimensions
of
knowledge
and
attitudes
the
contribution
of
this

extends
beyond
the

in
the

become
more

yet
the
digital

is
intensifying
especially
because
most

overall
the

indicate
the

computational

although

has
been
shown
to
improve

ct

students
may
fail
to
self-evaluate
or
debate
as
they
play
games
thus
failing
to
develop
higher-order

also
not
widely
explored
is
how
teachers
are
to
practice
the
ct
core

during
the

to
cultivate
students
problem-solving
thinking
as
the
adoption
of
student-generated
questions
sgq
is
an
instructional
strategy
to
promote
higher-order

we
develop
a
gbl
platform
that
uses
this
strategy
to
enhance
students

for
this
purpose
fifty-three
primary_school

this

shows
that
the
experimental

using
the

exhibited
significantly
higher

than
the

it
is
found
that

also
outperformed
the

this
confirms
that
integrating
the

fosters
higher-order
cognitive
thinking
in

as
a

in
their
lives
to
effectively
utilize
artificial

ai-based
technologies
such
as
chatgpt
and
realize
their
novel
ethical
issues
individuals
must
have
a
variety
of
knowledge
and
skills
about
ai
such
knowledge
and
skills
have
led
to
the
emergence
of
ai
literacy
despite
the
importance
of
ai
literacy
in
everyday
life
little
is
known
about
its
determinants
to
better
understand
the
determinants
of
ai
literacy
we
attempted
to
build
a
research
model
relying
on
previous
research
and
different
theoretical
frameworks
the
model
incorporated
digital
divide
cognitive
absorption
and
computational
thinking
as
a
major
finding
from
the
current
study
computational
thinking
was
found
to
be
a
significant
determinant
of
ai
literacy
which
facilitate
using
recognizing
and
evaluating
ai-based
technologies
moreover
we
found
out
that
individuals
with
physical
access
to
information
and
communication
technologies
icts
are
more
expected
to
use
and
recognize
ai
also
motivation
and
skills
in
using
icts
enable
individuals
to
better
evaluate
the
outcomes
of
ai-based

the
findings
also
showed
that
convenient
access
to
icts
contributes
to
a
deep
involvement
with
ai-based
technologies
in
the
use
further
individuals
with
higher
motivation
and
skills
to
use
ai
technologies
are
likely
to
have
a
pleasant
experience
after
using
these
technologies
both
computational
thinking
ct
and
creativity
have
been
recognized
as
key
skills
for
todays
learners
over
the
last
decade
research
of
both
skills
in
a
single
context
has
emerged
in
this
paper
we
present
a
scoping
review
of
62
such
empirical
from
2011
to
2020
our
goal
was
to
have
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
educational
settings
in
which
research
on
both
ct
and
creativity
was
conducted
the
theoretical
foundations
it
has
laid
down
and
the
research
tools
used
our
findings
indicate
a
geographical
bias
dominance
of
the
us
and
prominence
of
developed
european
countries
as
well
as
a
focus
on
secondary_education
and
on
stem-related
disciplines
this
could
be
explained
by
the
current
situation
of
ct
spread
we
also
found
that
when
studying
ct
and
creativity
jointly
it
is
most
common
to
define
ct
in
a
broader
perspective
than
merely
programming
of
computer
science
additionally
while
creativity
is
largely
referred
to
as
product-related
ct
is
barely
referred
to
as
such
taken
together
our
findings
point
out
some
gaps
in
the
current
research
of
ct
and
creativity
and
suggest
how
it
should
be
expended
on
the
fertile
grounds
of
creativity
as
the
latter
crosses
geographical
age
and
subject
borders
doing
so
may
build
a
bridge
between
ct
and
creativity
in
a
way
that
will
benefit
both

ct
ct
is
widely
elaborated
on
as
a
universal
problem-solving
approach
and
a
skill
set
necessary
for
thriving
in
today’s
digitized
societies
scholars
claim
that
ct
for
all
should
be
ensured
from
an
early
age
and
several
studies
develop
and
examine
age-appropriate
technological
tools
as
well
as
pedagogical
approaches
for
young
children’s
learning
of
ct
based
on
15
years
of

two
danish
kindergartens
the
present
study
conducts
a
socioculturally
informed
analysis
of
video-observed
interactions
between
children
and
educational
robots
the
findings
display
how
children
and
robots
engage
in
interactions
that
transcend
children’s
mastery
of
ct
in
any
narrow
sense
this
is
examined
as
situated
enactments
of

as
children’s
critical
and
informed
decisions
regarding
the
roles
that
technologies
in
this
case
educational
robots
can
play
in
their
institutionally
situated
social
lives
the
paper
concludes
that
children’s
various
enactments
of
ce
deserve
scholarly
and
professional
attention
both
as
an
important
prerequisite
for
and
as
a
necessary
limitation
to
the
implementation
of
ct
in
kindergartens
teaching
computational

ct
has
become
a
priority
for
educators
and
policymakers
tasked
with
educating
and
training
students
for
future
jobs
which
are
predicted
to
be
increasingly
automated
recent
research
on
effective
instructional
interventions
for
developing
computational
thinking
skills
including
algorithmic
and
critical_thinking
problem-solving
creativity
and
cooperativity
suggests
that
teaching
and
learning
ct
can
improve
student
academic
performance
in
fact
the
extant
literature
is
quite
sanguine
about
the
topic
of
ct
however
few
studies
have
attempted
to
establish
a
relationship
between
ct
skills
and
academic
performance
in
the
present
cross-sectional
study
we
employ
path
analysis
to
model
the
structural
relationship
between
self-reported
ct
skills
and
academic
performance
of
a
sample
of
81
computer
science
undergraduates
enrolled
at
a
southwestern
american
university
we
found
few
direct
relationships
between
ct
skills
and
academic
performance
we
only
find
a
significant
positive
relationship
between
creativity
and
academic
performance
and
a
significant
negative
relationship
between
cooperativity
and
academic
performance
our
findings
are
surprising
considering
the
abundant
research
promoting
computational
thinking
as
a
key
component
of
21st
century
skills
the
findings
call
for
further
in-depth
analysis
of
computational
thinking
and
the
influence
on
students’
learning
and
learning
outcomes
we
discuss
our
results
with
respect
to
recent
educational
mandates
for
including
ct
and
instructional
alignment
in
school
curricula
our
findings
contribute
to
the
existing
discussion
by
helping
to
clarify
the
relationship
between
ct
skills
and
academic

in

although

have
shown
that
computational

ct
can
enhance

they
have
not

how

were
made
for

in
this
regard
in
this
paper
we
explore
how
the
theoretical
notion
of
possibility
space
offers
a
way
to
study
how
childrens
computational
thinking
develops
as
a
process
drawing
on
embodied
notions
of
cognition
we
first
examine
the
literature
that
supports
how
childrens
computational
thinking
emerges
as
a
possibility
space
that
involves
conceptualizing
possible
actions
in
a
given
moment
deciding
which
action
to
take
by
anticipating
the
results
of
a
possible
action
and
learning
from
the
actions
that
they
have
taken
we
then
use
a
grounded
approach
to
analyze
the
problem-solving
process
of
two
5th-grade
children
who
engaged
in
an
educational
robotics
activity
over
two
50-minute
class
periods
the
findings
lend
support
for
approaching
childrens
computational
thinking
as
a
cycle
of
action-taking
that
includes
conceptualizing
anticipating
and
taking
action
the
findings
also
support
the
pedagogical
practice
of
having
children
predict
the
results
of
a
computer
program
to
enhance
their
computational
thinking
implications
for
the
way
that
teachers
can
support
children
in
learning
to
conceptualize
what
is
possible
and
take
action
from
it
are
discussed
predictive
learner

is
crucial
for

underline
the
potential
of

to
predict
their

as
a
result
a
valid

reliable
performance-based
platform
was
developed
for
measuring
computational
thinking
skills
it
has
also
been
concluded
that
the
performance-based
measurement
tool
makes
a
better
measurement
than
the

it
is
emphasized
that
computational

should
be
treated
as
a

not
as

therefore
it
is
believed
that
developing
performance-based
tools
for
evaluating
computational
thinking

and
measuring
them
by
using
multiple
measurement
tools
will
give
more
accurate
results
considering
the

it
is
thought
that
the

will
contribute
to

computational

a
growing
body
of
studies
has
managed
to
demonstrate
the
correlation
between
computational

and
different
cognitive

in
recent

multiple
studies
have
taken
place
that
seek
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
computational

on
higher-order
cognitive

the
current
study
aims
to
contribute
to
this
discussion
by
analyzing
the
effect
of
an
intervention
program
in
computational
thinking
on
the
executive
functions
of
school-age
children
in
this
experimental
study
30
children
aged
10
and
11
were
randomly
assigned
to
an
experimental
group
and
an
active
control
group
the
instruments
to
collect
the
data
were
15
tests
of
the
neuropsychological
battery
of
executive
functions
and
frontal
lobes
banfe-2
which
were
applied
to
both
groups
before
and
after
the
intervention
the
experimental
group
participated
in
an
8-week
computational

intervention
during
which
its
participants
enrolled
in
plugged
and
unplugged_activities
and
carried
out
block_programming
language
twice
a
week
the
results
showed
that
the
intervention
had
significant
effects
on
executive
functions
associated
with
the
anterior
prefrontal
cortex
and
the
dorsolateral
cortex
but
not
those
related
to
the

learning
coding
during
early
childhood
is
an
effective
way
for

to
practice
computational

aspects
of
childrens
motivation
can
increase
the
likelihood
that
children
approach
computational

activities
with
enthusiasm
and
deep
engagement
gender
inequities
may
interfere
with
childrens
readiness
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
to
build
computational

skills
through
activities
such
as
coding
societal
stereotypes
can
reduce
young
girls’
motivation
to
engage
with
computer
science
preventing
them
from
gaining
benefits
from
coding
activities
designed
to
support
computational
thinking
this
study
examined
childrens
gender
stereotypes
as
well
as
childrens
own
motivation
for
computer
coding
in
363
first-
through
third-grade
children
we
assessed
gender
differences
in
both
stereotypes
and
motivation
as
well
as
links
between
the
stereotypes
that
individual
children
held
and
their
own
motivation
children
generally
endorsed
stereotypes
about
interest
and
ability
for
computer
coding
that
favored
their
own-gender
group
although
third-grade
girls
reported
gender-egalitarian
beliefs
about
interest
in
coding
there
were
no
gender
differences
in
childrens
motivation
for
computer
coding
in
terms
of
their
own
interest
sense
of
belonging
or
ability
self-concepts
childrens
stereotypes
about
their
own-gender
group
were
significantly
positively
correlated
with
their
own
motivation
for
computer
coding
these
findings
suggest
that
early
childhood
represents
an
excellent
age
for
children
to
begin
building
computational
thinking
skills
before
girls
endorse
negative
stereotypes
about
their

interest
in

ct
is
an
essential
skill
students
need
if
they
are
to
adapt
to
the
rise
of
digital
society
and
the
evaluation
of
ct
is
crucial
for
enhancing
students’
ct
however
the
current
evaluation
of
ct
is
based
on
a
summative
paradigm
and
ignores
real
ct
performance
during
the
assessment
process
this
study
thus
used
a
multimodal
cognitive
diagnostic
model
h-mcdm
of
students’
ct
based
on
multimodal

in
situational
tasks
to
achieve
precise
evaluation
and
explore
the
current
mastery
status
of
students’
ct
and
their
cognitive

the
research
results
indicate
that
1
students’
ct
was
at
a
moderately
high
level
and
indicated
a
good
grasp
of
the
ct
components
of
problem
decomposition
and
algorithm
design
but
students
had
not
yet
mastered
problem

2
a

were
discerned
in

could
differ
in
their

this

showed
that
it

were
applied
to
a

features
ie
age
gender
and
coding
learning
experience
ie
years
of

ct
performance
was
significantly
predicted
by

and
the
results
remained

the
study
adds
to
the
literature
by
enriching
the
understanding
of

has
practical
implications
for

regarding
the
importance
of

and
the
integration
of

ones
we
argue
that

could
represent
a
way

include
the
analysis
and
characterization
of
the
most

techniques
and
their
crossover
with

the
synthesis
between
these
aspects
is
made

dimensions
of
eud
systems
suitable
to
work
scenarios
where
better

eudability
has
to
do
with

become
an
integral
component
of

worldwide
necessitating
teachers
to
develop
this
competence
in
their
students
to
effectively
meet
these

teachers
themselves
need
a
solid
foundation
of
computational

which
refers
to
the
understanding

area
however
despite
widespread
recognition
of
this
need
few

findings
showed
that
connecting
powerful
ideas
from
computational

namely
algorithms
and
problem_solving
eg
debugging
to
familiar
activities
and
experiences
served
as
a
powerful
entry

yet
differences
arose
in
how

the
development
of

ct
has
become
integral
to
many

this
has
been
associated
with
calls
for

competency
valuable
to
all

as
a
transferable
process
for

however
while
computational

is
a
focus
of
most

proponents
such
as

argue
its

computational

ct
has
been
considered
one
of
the
21st

skills
that
already

should
develop
in
this

teach
n
70
second

and
scratch-based

blocks
software
to
navigate
a
maze
while
the
control
group
used
regular

and
verbal

results
supported
our
hypotheses
students
in
the
experimental

outperformed
those
in
the
control
condition
produced
longer
sequences
and
more
sequence
commands
to
direct
their
object
through
the
maze
and
a
positive
relationship
was
observed
between
sequence
length
and
posttest

furthermore
mediation
analysis
revealed
that
the
effect
of
the
intervention
on
posttest
achievement
was
influenced
by
the
use
of
longer

our
study
underpins
that
scratch-based
block_programming
combined
with
robot-like
real-world
devices
is
a
promising
way
to
utilize
ct
in
early
primary_education—and
deepens
our
knowledge
about
how
students
engage
in
relevant
learning
activities
the
integration
of
computational
thinking
ct
into
k-12
education
offers
substantial
potential
to
improve
digital
literacy
and
deepen
students’
understanding
across
various
subject
areas
by
embedding
computational
procedures
and
solution-oriented
approaches
into
traditional
curricula
students
can
develop
essential
skills
that
are
critical
for
thriving
in
an
increasingly
digital
world
however
the
effective
integration
of
ct
into
subject-specific
learning
poses
challenges
for
educators
largely
due
to
a
lack
of
training
and
experience
in
implementing
interdisciplinary
instructional
strategies
this
study
explores
the
impact
of
integrating
ct
into
k-12
education
through
diverse
instructional
approaches
including
modelling
storytelling
and
unplugged_activities
the
research
examines
how
students
subject
knowledge
ct
concepts
and
practices
evolved
under
each
ct
integration
practice
as
well
as
their
acceptance
toward
ct
integrated
lessons
the
study
was
conducted
in
different
subjects
including
language
arts
biology
and
physics
and
at
different
grade
levels
the
technology
acceptance
model
was
used
as
a
theoretical
framework
to
understand
students
adoption
towards
the
different
integration
practices
the
study
revealed
that
different
ct
integration
practices
yield
varying
impacts
on
students
attitudes
particularly
in
relation
to
their
prior
programming
experiences
namely
primary_school
students
with
prior
programming
experience
display
a
higher
behavioural
intention
due
to
a
lack
of
early
biases
toward
programming
conversely
secondary_school
students
less
familiar
with
interdisciplinary
approaches
initially
show
less
enthusiasm
for
future
engagement
these
insights
underscore
the
need
for
tailored
instructional
strategies
that
consider
students
prior
experiences
and
the
broader
goal
of
preparing
them
to
contribute
to
a
technologically
driven
society
as
we
begin
to
identify
essential
skills
for
the
future
there
has
been
an
increased
focus
on
how
to
define
and
implement
computational
thinking
within
education
however
the
question
of
how
to
engage
children
with
coding
activities
within
the
context
and
limitations
of
the
curriculum
remains
relatively
explored
in
our
study
a
human-centered
design
approach
was
followed
to
guide
a
small
group
of
children
through
the
co-design
implementation
and
evaluation
of
a
board
game
the
board
game
had
two
versions
an
offline
version
involving
a
robotic
agent
and
an
online
version
with
its
digital
equivalent
a
mixed-method
approach
was
used
to
understand
and
compare
levels
of
engagement
usability
and
collaboration
in
both
versions
of
the
game
the
tangible
aspect
of
working
with
a
robotic
agent
in
the
offline
version
led
to
greater
levels
of
motivation
and
involvement
with
the
game
mechanics
tangible
robotics
games
tend
to
be
more
approachable
for
children
our
study
shows
that
using
such
games
by
connecting
the
mathematics
curriculum
with
coding
problems
can
successfully
engage
participants
in
collaborative
computational
thinking
activities
we
contribute
to
the
field
by
providing
human-centered
guidance
for
the
creation
of
educational
tools
to
develop
computational
thinking
such
guidance
is
not
only
applicable
in
technologically
rich
environments
it
can
also
be
applied
in
educational
communities
with
limited
access
to
technology
computational
thinking
ct
has
been
relevant
in
teaching
stem
courses
and
educators
are
incorporating
both
plugged
and
unplugged
ct
activities
in
their
modules
to
prepare
new
entrants
for
advanced
knowledge
however
additional
empirical
data
are
needed
to
understand
how
an
unplugged_activities
approach
can
lead
to
an
improved
understanding
of
ct
concepts
therefore
this
study
investigates
the
impact
of
unplugged_activities
on
novice
students
ct
skills
and
unravels
the
characteristics
of
students
ct
competency
from
performing
unplugged_activities
the
experimental
aspect
of
this
study
was
conducted
with
a
cohort
of
210
students
participating
in
an
introductory
programming
course
at
a
university
in
nigeria
a
mixed-method
research
approach
and
a
quasi-experimental
design
were
applied
in
this
study
to
understand
how
the
unplugged
approach
in
teaching
ct
could
help
students
improve
their
ct
competency
a
paired-sample
t-test
of
familiarity
score
for
each
ct
concept
showed
a
significant
increase
in
the
score
before
and
after
the
intervention
furthermore
latent
dirichlet

lda
was
used
for
topic
modeling
of
the
text
describing

topic
modeling
allows
for
more
insights
into
the
steps
taken
by
the
students
to
solve
ct

only
2762
of

solved
the

with
an

and
7241
of

who
applied
ct
concepts
of
problem
abstraction
and

were
able
to
solve
the

correctly
indeed
ct
unplugged_activities
significantly
increased
the
number
of
students
who
gained
ct
competency
in
addition
this
study
provides
recommendation
for
computer

educators
and
highlight
future
direction
computational
thinking
is
a
fundamental
competence
that
is
being
introduced
in
k-12
and
succeeding
curricula
worldwide
despite
this
huge
effort
many
computational
thinking
models
in
the
literature
do
not
explicitly
take
into
consideration
the
pupils’
age
and
the
developmental
nature
of
computational
thinking
skills
furthermore
many
existing
computational
thinking
models
are
focused
on
the
internal
thinking
processes
of
the
individuals
failing
to
explicitly
consider
the
situated
nature
in
terms
of
social
context
and
artefactual
environment
that
usually
characterise
tasks
that
require
computational
thinking
to
be
solved
in
this
paper
we
present
a
framework
for
the
design
realisation
analysis
and
assessment
of
computational
thinking
activities
called
ct-cube
the
ct-cube
allows
to
extend
existing
computational
thinking
models
to
consider
the
life-long
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
in
individuals
from
childhood
to
adult
age
and
to
take
into
consideration
the
situated
nature
of
computational
thinking
activities
we
use
the
ct-cube
to
design
an
unplugged
task
called
cross
array
task
cat
allowing
to
assess
the
algorithmic
skills
of
k-12
pupils
and
we
show
how
the
ct-cube
can
be
used
in
this
case
to
illustrate
the
development
of
this
competence
along
the
entire
compulsory

path
considering
a

the
current

were
obtained
based
on
the
pre-test-post-test
classroom
observation

the
results
show
that
the
grammar
application
in
short
essay
writing
of
all
the

significantly
improved
and
that

were
unfolded
to
show
the

however
not
all
the

showed
similar
results
ct
serves
as
an
important
social
mediation
tool
in
efl
teaching
this
study
further
enriches
the
teaching

and
is
an
effective
attempt
at
introducing
ct
into

patterns
with
growing
interest
in
supporting
the
development
of
computational

ct
in

there
is
also
need
for
new
assessments
that
serve
multiple
purposes
and
uses
in
particular
there
is
a
need
to
understand
the
design
of

that
can
be
used
during

to
provide

in
this

we
report
on

considered
one
of

however
due

computational

ct
the
conceptual
foundations
required
for
solving
complex
problems
effectively
and
efficiently
is
an
imperative
skill
for
todays
learners
across
disciplines
and
across
ages
as
for
its
importance
in
the
wide
network
of
digital
literacies
ct
has
been
implemented
in
various
educational
contexts
however
mostly
via
digital
artifacts
specifically
in
programming-related
activities
this
approach
does
not
fulfill
the
potential
of
such
integration
for
promoting
learning
in
this
paper
we
argue
that
digital
literacies
should
not
be
bound
to
the
digital
realm
and
present
a
novel
approach
to
fully
integrate
ct
into
learning
and
teaching
by
the
development
of
ct-infused
“unplugged”
pedagogical
tools
that
are
fully
embedded
in
the
subject
matter
we
demonstrate
the
advantages
to
student
learning
of
these
tools
in
two
case
studies
from
k-12
mathematics
education
1
an
assistive
tool
for
function
investigation
in
high-school
calculus
–
in
this
case
we
point
out
to
how
ct
skills
that
were
implemented
in
the
tool
promoted
students
problem_solving
2
a
teaching
unit
for
pattern
sequences
in
elementary_school
–
in
this
case
we
show
how
students
in
the
ct
research
group
outperformed
students
in
the
other
groups
and
how
they
implemented
ct
to
solve
pattern
sequence
problems
effectively
and
efficiently
we
highlight
that
besides
enhancing
learning
this
approach
can
help
address
the
important
issue
of
equity
in
education
and
suggest
ways
to
promote
it
via
dedicated
professional
development
creativity
and
computational
thinking
ct
have
been
pointed
out
as
two
important
skills
that
would
promote
students
in
the
digital
age
as
contributing
members
of
society
therefore
these
two
constructs
have
been
extensively
researched
in
recent
years
but
the
associations
between
them
are
yet
to
be
fully
understood
this
study
takes
another
step
towards
bridging
this
gap
by
examining
the
association
between
ct
and
three
types
of
creativity
ie
figural
creative
thinking
verbal
creative
thinking
and
computational
creativity
data
was
collected
from
119
ninth-grade
students
14–15

took
two
commonly

they
also
used
kodetu—an
online

environment
for
ct—and
we
used
the
system
log
files
to
measure
their
ct
acquirement
and
their
computational
creativity
findings
suggest
some
nuanced
associations
between
the
four
sets
of
variables
specifically
we
point
out
the
limited
associations
between
verbal
and
figural
creativities
some
of
which
are
negative
also
we
found
that
the
associations
between
creative
thinking
and
ct
as
well
as
between
creative

and
computational

differ
by

however
during

accordingly
we
have

this

characterizes
the

ct
to
preschoolers
aged
4
to
5
years
previous
research
and
published
systematic
studies
have
provided
important
contributions
about
ct
teaching
to
elementary
and
high_school
children
however
to
date
there
is
no
systematic
overview
of
ct
education
for
preschoolers
for
this
reason
this
systematic

synthesizes
82
studies
on

teaching
through
the
implementation
and
evaluation
of
tools
and
activities
to

improve
or
measure
the
ct

acquired
by

furthermore
studies
on
courses
or
training
offered
to
preschool
teachers
related
to
the
teaching
of
ct
were
also
considered
from
the
selected

the

how
they
are

and
finally
participants
and

responsible
for
the

the
results
suggest
an
increase
in
the
number
of
publications
in
recent
years
revealing
the
interest
of
researchers
in
the
topic
furthermore
we
observed
a
trend
towards
the
use
of
physical
artifacts
and
the
use
of
the
disconnected
computing
approach
to
teaching
ct
skills
to
preschool
children
the
results
also
exposed
that
preschool
teachers
have
little
autonomy
in
implementing
ct
teaching
activities
because
those
are
mostly
implemented
by
computer
professionals
researchers
teachers
etc
this
is
because
preschool
teachers
are
still
discouraged
from
teaching
computer
and
technology-related
content
to
children
considering
them
complex
and
disconnected
from
basic
curricula
however
when
teachers
are
trained
to
teach
ct
they
become
interested
in
the
content
and
become
more
active
during
the
teaching
process
we
argue
for
integrating
ct-related
content
into
education
curricula
and
supporting
preschool
teachers
to
implement
it
autonomously
in
their
classrooms
this
paper
deals
within
a
context
where
technology
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
education
in
this
sense
it
is
essential
to
highlight
the
emergence
of
new
competencies
and
skills
in
education
due
to
technological
advancements
legislative
frameworks
have
been
developed
to
incorporate
digital
literacy
access
to
robotics
and
computational
thinking
between
others
hence
this
review
and
meta-analysis
aim
at
identifying
the
influence
of
robotics
activities
on
computational
thinking
through
a
prisma-guided
review
the
findings
reveal
that
interventions
conducted
in
early_childhood_education
significantly
impact
computational
thinking
results
also
showcase
that
despite
perceived
barriers
related
to
technology
accessibility
the
presence
of
legislation
and
contexts
prioritizing
these
competencies
is
more
relevant
than
the
digital
access
gap
since
computational
thinking
is
a
high-level
cognitive
skill
and
its
conceptual
framework
has
not
yet
been
clarified
the
assessment
of
this
skill
is
problematic
while
there
is
no
consensus
in
the
literature
about
the
components
of
computational
thinking
the
abstraction
component
is
located
at
a
point
where
opinions
intersect
in
addition
it
is
predicted
that
computer
science
unplugged_activities
will
improve
computational
thinking
and
there
is
limited
research
examining
this
effect
as
a
result
this
research
aims
to
demonstrate
the
alleged
effects
of
computer
science
unplugged_activities
on
abstraction
skill
which
is
considered
the
critical
component
of
computational
thinking
the
study
which
was
planned
with
a
mixed_methods
research
design
lasted
8
weeks
quantitative
data
were
obtained
from
the
abstraction
skill
test
developed
by
the
researchers
while
qualitative
data
were
obtained
from
observations
and
task-
based
interviews
after
each
activity
quantitative
findings
showed
that
computer
science
unplugged_activities
significantly
improve
abstraction
skills
and
thus
computational
thinking
qualitative
findings
not
only
revealed
that
developments
in
the
six
abstracting
steps
caused
this
significant
difference
but
also
identified
abstracting
steps
where
the
effect
of
each
activity
was
limited
suggestions
for
organizing
activities
to
improve
these
steps
are
given
finally
suggestions
are
presented
for
the
conceptual
framework
of
computational
thinking
based
on
abstraction
the
healthy
development
of
cognitive
functions
including
executive
functions
has
been
shown
to
depend
mainly
on
the
experiences
and
learning
opportunities
of
people
especially
during
childhood
over
the
past
few
years
researchers
have
been
studying
the
impacts
of
diverse
types
of
interventions
on
children’s
cognitive
development
in
which
computational
thinking
programs
are
a
recent
field
this
pilot
study
evaluated
the
effect
of
computational
thinking
training
based
on
the
“programming

program
on
the
executive
functions
of
children
aged
10
and
11
years
working

the
results
showed
that
children
in
the
experimental
group
improved
on
tests
of
visuospatial
working
memory
cognitive
inhibition
and
sequential
planning
compared
with
the
control
group
however
tests
of
verbal
working
memory
memory
strategy
and
visual
spatial
planning
did
not
show
any
observed
changes
although
this
was
an
exploratory
study
and
its
findings
should
be
interpreted
cautiously
due
to
the
small
sample
size
the
findings
support
the
relevance
and
feasibility
of
conducting
similar
larger
studies
with
larger
samples
computational
thinking
has
been
promoted
as
an
impactful
21st-century
skillset
that
can
be
transferred
to
many
other
disciplines
and
problem
scenarios
with
the
proliferation
of
age-appropriate
coding
platforms
for
young
children
computational
thinking
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
early
childhood
settings
however
there
is
a
lack
of
research
on
introducing
coding
and
computational
thinking
to
teacher
training
in
early_childhood_education
to
empower
early
childhood
teachers
in
the
digital
society
this
study
introduced
17
early
childhood
teachers
to
robot
programming
and
computational
thinking
through
the
‘ct4ece’
professional
development
program
which
includes
three
phases

and
reflect
improve
results
of
pre-

post-intervention
surveys
revealed
that
the
ct4ece
program
significantly
enhanced
teachers
robotics
and
pedagogical
knowledge
as
well
as
their
attitudes
towards
computational
thinking
especially
their
interest
in
and
their
view
of
using
computational
thinking
in
classroom
practice
post-intervention
interviews
indicated
that
participation
in
ct4ece
helped
educators
gain
a
basic
understanding
of
both
coding
robots
and
computational

suitable
for
young
children
due
to
a
structured
change

this
study
establishes
a
strong
foundation
for
enhancing
and
expanding
the
ct4ece
program
ultimately
equipping
teachers
and
children
with
the
necessary
skillsets
to
thrive
in
the

post-test
scores
for

showed
a
statistically
significant
difference
in

of
the
experimental

it
was
concluded
that
the
uct-stem
approach
was
more
effective
in
developing
the
pre-service
teachers’
ct
skills
than
the
stem
approach
the
current
study
presents
an
important
finding
to
the
literature
in
terms
of
the
developed
stem
and
uct-stem
contents
and
how
these
contents
improve
pre-service
teachers’
ct
skills
the
stem
and
uct-stem
content
provides
significant
information
in
terms
of
teacher
practices
at
the
same
time
this
study
offers
important
implications
for
program
developers
and
policy-makers
to
integrate
these
innovative
educational
approaches
into
both
early_childhood_education
and
teacher
education
programs
the
integration
of
computational
thinking
ct
to
enhance
creativity
in
design
students
has
often
been
underexplored
in
design
education
while
design
thinking
has
traditionally
been
the
cornerstone
of
university
design
pedagogy
and
remains
essential
the
increasing
role
of
digital
tools
and
artificial
intelligence
in
modern
design
practices
presents
new
opportunities
for
innovation
by
introducing
ct
alongside
design
thinking
students
can
expand
their
creative
toolkit
and
engage
with
emerging
technologies
more
effectively
although
many
design
students
may
have
limited
experience
with
programming
incorporating
accessible
no-code
tools
can
help
them
confidently
embrace
computational
methods
unlocking
new
pathways
for
creative
exploration
and
innovation
this
study
proposes
an
alternative
approach
to
improve
the
motivation
of
design
students
by
introducing
machine
learning
tools
into
product
design
processes
we
developed
an
experimental
pedagogy
in
which

analysis
weka
a
machine

for

work
a

for
a
total
of
eight
weeks
our
covariate
analysis
of
data
collected
in
the
pretest
and
posttest
shows
that
the
general
learning
motivations
in
the
group
using
weka
are
significantly
higher
than
those
in
the
group
without
weka
however
no
significant
differences
were
found
between
the
two
groups
in
terms
of
learning
strategies
collaboration
or
critical_thinking
students
using
weka
spent
more
time
focusing
on
model
training
and
tended
to
improve
their
algorithmic_thinking
and
the
introduction
of
weka
appeared
to
enhance
their
motivation
to
learn
on
the
other
hand
these
students
might
have
been
focusing
on
working
individually
at
their
computers
potentially
neglecting
communication
and
collaboration
the
findings
suggest
that
teaching
machine
learning
applications
without
requiring
coding
has
the
potential
to
boost
design
students
motivation
to
engage
with
ct
skills
though
care
must
be
taken
to
maintain
collaborative
practices
there
is
increasing
effort
to
integrate
computational
thinking
ct
curricula
across
all
education
levels
therefore
research
on
ct
assessment
has
lately
progressed
towards
developing
and
validating
reliable
ct
assessment
tools
which
are
crucial
for
evaluating
students
potential
learning
progress
and
thus
the
effectiveness
of
suggested
curricular
programs
several
ct
assessment
tools
were
developed
for
elementary
high-school
and
university
students
over
the
last
years
moreover
associations
between
ct
scores
and
other
cognitive
abilities
were
unraveled
however
studies
on
the
topic
in
primary_school
level
are
scarce
like
the
general
concept
of
intelligence
ct
remains
broadly
defined
as
the
ability
to
combine
algorithmic
operations
to
form
complex
solutions
in
order
to
solve
problems
effectively
utilizing
concepts
of
computer
science
with
or
without
the
use
of
computers
in
this
study
we
aimed
at
specifying
a
cognitive
definition
of
ct
focusing
on
the
under-investigated
population
of
primary_school
children
since
validated
assessment
tools
for
this
age
group
were
not
available
we
adapted
a
validated
ct
test
which
was
initially
designed
for
middle
school
students
in
our
study
participated
192
third
and
fourth
graders
the
analyses
revealed
promising
results
on
the
reliability
of
the
adapted
ct
assessment
for
primary_school
students
moreover
findings
indicated
cts
positive
associations
with
i
complex
numerical
abilities
ii
verbal
reasoning
abilities
and
iii
non-verbal
visuospatial
abilities
our
results
indicate
similarities
but
also
differences
in
associations
of
ct
with
other
cognitive
abilities
in
primary_school
children
compared
to
other
age
groups
in
summary
i
numerical
abilities
seem
to
associate
with
ct
at
the
primary_school
level
whereas
this
seems
not
the
case
later
on
in
education
ii
verbal
abilities
seem
to
associate
with
ct
both
along
primary
and
secondary_education
levels
and
iii
non-verbal
reasoning
abilities
seem
to
associate
with
ct
from
primary_education
level
to
the
university
level
and
beyond
these
differences
imply
that
several
basic
cognitive
abilities
support
ct
abilities
and
ct
development
differentially
across
ages
the
concept
of
artificial

evolves
into
one
of

that
provide

to
better
themselves
in
a

of
areas
unlike
the
previous

which
are
limited

proposed
a
unique

laboratory
by
enabling

to
explore
an

however
the

of
the

to
be
explored
motivated
to
fill
the

gap
and
to
consider
the

this
paper
aims
to
analyze
the
possible
intertwined
relationship
between
students’
intrinsic
motivation
for
learning
artificial
intelligence
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
the
relationship
between

concepts
and
the
underlying
dynamic
relation
if

based
upon

students
in
the
institute
for
educational

and
the
school
of
naval

during
the
first
quarter
of
2022
findings
show
that
intrinsic
motivation
mediates
the
relationship
between
perceived
artificial
intelligence
learning
and
computational
thinking
also
the
research
indicates
that
intrinsic
motivation
has
a
significant
relationship
with
computational
thinking
and
perceived
artificial
intelligence
learning
computational
thinking
is
widely
recognized
as
an
essential
skill
for
adapting
to
the
current
era
with
programming
learning
being
the
most
effective
means
to
develop
it
it
is
recommended
that
computational
thinking
and
learning
programming
be
introduced
as
early
as
elementary_school
however
elementary_school
students
often
possess
limited
prior
knowledge
of
programming
posing
challenges
in
their
learning
process
the
graphic
organizers
gos
may
serve
as
a
bridge
between
students’
existing
knowledge
and
new
learning
facilitating
a
deeper
processing
of
the
overall
information
and
thereby
enhancing
the
learning
process
this
can
be
particularly
advantageous
for
early-stage
learners
when
grappling
with
difficult
subjects
consequently
this
study
employed
gos
to
assist
elementary_school
students
in
their
computational
thinking
and
programming
learning
employing
a
quasi-experiment
design
to
evaluate
their
effectiveness
the
results
showed
that
although
all
students
demonstrated
awareness
of
applying
computational
thinking
to
solve
problems
those
exposed
to
go-based
instruction
exhibited
higher
levels
of
computational

programming
skills
and
flow

computational

is
a
critical
cognitive
tool
for
students
to
overcome
challenges
in
this
technological

were
discussed
in
bringing
ct

engagement
is
critical
to
computational

and
programming
education
however
as
multi-dimensional
variables
when
analyzing
how
different
aspects
of
engagement
in
computational
thinking
tasks
influence
skills
development
it
becomes
crucial
to
discern
precisely
which
engagement
components
intersect
with
the
progression
of
computational
thinking
skills
this
discernment
is
pivotal
because
engagement
can
vary
based
on
the
task
nature
the
context
and
the
individuals
preferences
therefore
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
explore
the
gender
differences
in
engagement
and
computational
thinking
skills
and
the
predictive
relationships
among
these
sub-dimensions
for
boys
and
girls
in
an
unplugged
environment
in
this
study
a
quasi-experiment
for
90
sixth-grade
students
from
a
north
chinese
primary_school
was
performed
by
partial
least
squares–structural
equation
modeling
students’
models
of
computational
thinking
skills
and
engagement
were
analyzed
and
comparisons
of
boys
and
girls
were
made
by
analysis
of
covariance
statistics
results
indicated
that
compared
with
boys
girls
reported
higher
computational
thinking
performance
and
more
engagement
in
unplugged
contexts
furthermore
girls’
computational
thinking
skills
were
only
predicted
by
their
cognitive
engagement
whereas
boys’
computational
thinking
skills
were
predicted
by
their
behavioral
emotional
and
cognitive
engagement
teachers
can
adopt
these
findings
to
design
computational
thinking
teaching
interventions
that
combine
the
advantages
of
unplugged
activity
and
focus
on
the
engagement
of
boys
and
girls
in
this
work
we
argue
for
expanding
the
scope
of
k-12
computational
thinking
ct
integration
contexts
to
include
everyday
scenarios
involving
moral
reasoning
epistemic
overlap
between
computational
thinking
practices
and
moral
reasoning
suggest
that
these
contexts
are
potentially
rich
sites
to
see
“seeds
of
ct”
in
childrens
reasoning
and
can
provide
rich
educational
pathways
for
children
into
ct
taking
a
case-study
approach
we
examine
the
reasoning
of
a
second-grader
ollie
on
a
task
involving
fair
allocation
of
resources
to
victims
of
a
natural

introduces
the

package
a

the
latter
is
based
on
a

that
follows
a

and
uses
the

technique
this
algorithm
is
a
reusable

component
that
is

and
efficient
moreover
it
has
been
developed
by
paying
special
attention
to

we
add
the

to
this

is
beneficial
in
two
settings
in

and
whenever
using

we
present
a
qualitative

conducted
by
group
interviews
with
designers
of
two
common
but
significantly
different
programmable

the
kubo
robot
and
the
rugged
robot
using
activity
theory
as
the
underlying
framework
for
the
thematic
analysis
of
the
interviews
our
data
reveal
a
large
overlap
of
the
intentions
of
both
groups
they
express
the
common
goal
of
preparing
children
for
the

although
through
slightly
different

skills
respectively
both
groups
highlight
the
relevance
of
subjects
outside
computer

specifically
beyond

our

also
show
a
design

difference
the
rugged
robot
was
developed
with
a
teacher-oriented
approach
whereas
the
kubo
robot
with
an
object-oriented
approach
despite
the
significant
emphasis
placed
on
incorporating
21st
century
skills
into
the
educational
framework
particularly
at
the
primary
level
recent
scholarly
works
indicate
considerable
variation
in
the
implementation
of
these

across
different

suggesting
a
demand
for
further

is
clear
to
initiate
a
transition
from

we
want
to

to
reflect
on
the

suggests
a

can
be
effective
in

several
studies
have
reported
that
adaptivity
and
personalization
in
educational
computer
games
facilitate
reaching
their
full
educational
potential
however
there
is
little
effort
to
develop
adaptive
educational
computer
games
for
promoting

computational
thinking
ct
in
this
study
an
adaptive
computer
game
is
introduced
called
autothinking
that
not
only
promotes
both
ct
skills
and
conceptual
knowledge
but
also
provides
adaptivity
in
both
game-play
and
learning
processes
to
evaluate
the
possible
effects
of
the
game
an
experimental
study
was
carried
out
with
79
students
in
an
elementary_school
in
estonia
autothinking
and
a
conventional
technology-enhanced_learning
approach
were
used
for
teaching
ct
to
the
experimental
and
control
group
respectively
our
results
reveal
that
autothinking
improved
students’
ct
skills
and
conceptual
knowledge
better
than
the
conventional
approach
it
was
also
found
that
students
with
a
low
and
high
level
of
prior
knowledge
made
higher
improvement
in
knowledge
gain
using
the
adaptive
game
compared
to
the
traditional
approach
especially
those
students
with
lower
prior
knowledge
finally
our
findings
show
that
the
adaptive
game
could
also
improve
students
learning
attitude
toward
ct
better
than
the
conventional
approach
especially
those
students
with
higher
prior
learning
attitudes
computational

is
considered
an
important
skill
for
students
to
become

and
thrive
in

despite
the
wide
interest
a
systematic

is
still
missing
the
aim
of
this

is
twofold
first
we
aim
to
provide
a
systematic
map
of
the
relevant
research
by
identifying
the
areas
and
sub-areas
of
ct
through
programming
teaching
and
learning
in
higher_education
second
we
aim
to
investigate
these
areas
based
on
two
dimensions
their
evolution
over
the
years
and
the
branches
to
which
ct
is
applied
for
this
purpose
we
apply
a
systematic

methodology
main

include
the
identification
of
the
ct
areas
of

base
assessment
learning
strategies

of
these
knowledge
base
assessment
and
tools
have
significantly
evolved
throughout
the
years
while
capacity
building
has
only
recently
emerged
in
addition
the
introduction
of
ct
to
undergraduate
students
and
preservice
teachers
differs
mainly
in
the
tools
used
and
the
ct
elements
that
are
assessed
the
study
contributes
to
the
field
by
providing
a
structured
type
of
research
conducted
and
identifying
gaps
and
opportunities
for
future
research
providing
high-quality
instruction
with
technology
has
become
more
important
than
ever
before
however
the
instructional
practices
and
the
degree
to
which
key
skills
such
as
digital
literacy
and
computational

are
emphasized
in
classrooms
vary
considerably
between
teachers

the
present

sheds
new
light
on
the
possible
factors
related
to

and
advances
the
field
by
taking
a
multilevel
and
international
perspective
on
these
factors
computational

ct
through

attracts
increased
attention
as
it
is
considered
an
ideal
medium
for
the
development
of
21st

skills
this
intense
attention
leads
to
k-12
initiatives
around
the
world
and
a
rapid
increase
in
relevant
research
studies
however
studies
show
challenges
in

in

the
purpose
of
this

is
to
develop
a
conceptual
model
based
on
a
systematic

review
that
maps

in
this
field
secondary

were
particularly
well-suited
for

in
this
article
we
discuss
how
mathematics
can
play
a
role
in
stem
activities
in
k–12
classrooms
from
the
perspective
of
content
we
argue
that
mathematics
serves
as
a
language
tool
to
help
representmodel
stem
activities
and
explaininterpret
identified
solutions
from
the
perspective
of
process
we
argue
that
mathematics
serves
as
a
thinking
tool
because
mathematical
reasoning
is
at
the
core
of
problem_solving
in
addition
computational
thinking
is
a
critical
skill
for
solving
problems
in
complex
systems
we
conclude
our
study
with
three
suggestions
that
help
make
mathematics
more
explicit
in
k–12
stem
classrooms
we
present
a
theory
of
the
causes
of
difficulty
in
children’s
creation
of
informal
programs
ten-year-old
children
are
able
to
devise
such
programs
to
rearrange
the
order
of
the
cars
in
trains
on
a
simple
railway
track
with
a
single
siding
according
to
the
theory
they
rely
on
kinematic
mental
models
that
simulate
the
required
sequence
of
steps
and
we
devised
a
computer
program
mabducer
which
does
so
too
in
creating
its
own
programs
for
such
rearrangements
an
experiment
showed
that
a
simple
measure
of
the
complexity
of
its
programs
based
on
kolmogorov
complexity
predicts
ten-year-olds’
difficulty
in
this
task
the
measure
is
the
number
of
words
in
mabducer’s
programs
for
solving
the
rearrangement
in
a
minimal
number
of
moves
complexity
in
turn
reflects
the
structure
of
the
required
programs
which
need
loops
of
moves
to
be
repeated
and
often
moves
before
and
after
such
a
loop
children’s
errors
are
predictable
in
both
their
location
and
nature
our
results
therefore
have
implications
for
the
assessment
and
pedagogy
of
computational
thinking
computational
thinking
ct
practices
have
gained
increasing
importance
in
primary_school
education
however
there
are
few
tools
to
measure
primary_school
students
ct
practices
that
are
based
on
rigorous
psychometric
approaches
this
study
developed
an
operational
definition
for
ct
practices
by
exploring
the
key
dimensions
of
their
composition
and
more
importantly
developed
and
validated
a
generic
test
tool
that
can
effectively
assess
students’
ct
practices
items
to
measure
ct
practices
were
developed
using
the
evidence-centered
design
ecd
approach
these
items
prompted
students
to
exhibit
behaviors
that
demonstrated
their
skills
in
the
four
dimensions
of
ct
practice
namely
testing
and
debugging
algorithmic_thinking
reusing
and
remixing
and

of
these
items
was
administered
to

the
data
were
analyzed
based

irt
approach
together
with
other
psychometric

a
bi-factor
three-parameter
logistic
model
was
ultimately
adopted
for

validation
as
it
fitted
the

better
than
the

the

reviewed
in
this

programming
can
be
introduced
to
young

in
the
development
of

in
which
the

to
the
development
of
computer

but
it
is
also
used
in

we
aim
to
better

demonstrate
that

that

it
also
questions
the

from
the
non-technical

employ
during

this

that
cope
with

—
the

in

the

attention
in
educational

where
robot

are
becoming
a

as
the
field
of

continues
to

what
it

for

to

computationally
much
is
unknown
about
the
affective

how
children

how

this

malfunctioned
drawing

feminist
perspectives
on

and
care
we
develop
a
notion
of

and
locate
this
in

we
present
two

we
argue
that
an

must
be
part
of
computational
discourses
in
an
era
of
climate
change
where
caring
for

this
chapter
introduces
the
concept
of
computational
thinking
it
first
reviews
the
main
goals
of
parallel
programming
it
then
discusses
the
thinking
process
of
algorithm
selection
and
problem
decomposition
for
a
given
problem
the
programmer
will
typically
have
to
select
from
a
variety
of
algorithms
some
of
these
algorithms
achieve
different
tradeoffs
while
maintaining
the
same
numerical
accuracy
others
involve
sacrificing
some
level
of
accuracy
to
achieve
much
more
scalable
running
times
for
the
selected
algorithm
different
choices
of
problem
decomposition
can
result
in
different
levels
of
interference
between
threads
parallelism
exposed
load
imbalance
and
other
performance
considerations
during
parallel
execution
computational
thinking
skills
allow
an
algorithm
designer
to
work
around
the
roadblocks
and
reach
a
good
solution
programming
is
an
important
way
to
cultivate
students’
computational

ct
skills
which
is
the
essential
ability
of
students
in
the
21st

as
one
of
the
mainstream
forms
of
programming
education
activities
unplugged
programming
activities
are
mainly
implemented
in
the
early
stage
of
basic

however
considering
the
lack
of
programming
experience
among
chinese
junior
high
schoolers
and
the
uneven
distribution
of
programming
education
resources
an
8-week
quasi-experimental
study
was
conducted
to
verify
the
effectiveness
of
unplugged_activities
in
improving
junior
high
schoolers’
ct
skills
and
to
identify
the
influence
of
multiple
factors
a
total
of
93
7th-graders
volunteered
to
participate
in
the

62
students
were
divided
into
two
experimental

which
were
intervened
by
unplugged_activities
to
repeat
the
results’
reliability
and
31
students
were
used
as
the
control
group
without
any
unplugged
programming
activities
the
results
of
the
intra-group
and
inter-group
comparison
show
that
unplugged
programming
is
a
more
effective
way
to
improve
7th-graders’
ct
skills
students’
mathematic
performance
and
previous
programming
experience
had
a
significant
impact
on
their
ct
skills
but
this
impact
is
not
reflected
in
the
process
of
unplugged

it
can
be
said
that
all
students
can
develop
their
ct
skills
through
unplugged
programming

background
in
the

in

we
conduct

we
first
identify

we
use

then
using

we
then
use

in

overall
we
find
that
research
on
21st

skills
has
grown
exponentially
in
the
past
two
decades
however
few
researchers
focus
primarily
on
this
topic
the
existing
research
is
primarily
dominated
by
psychologists
education
researchers
and
technology
researchers
we
also
find
that
specific
disciplines
such
as
industrial
engineering
and
nursing
are
prominent
contributors
in
the
field
and
that
critical_thinking
and
computational

are
key
areas
of
focus
computational
thinking
and
coding
are
becoming
an
integral
part
of
k-12
education
with
female
students
being
underrepresented
in
such
subjects
the
proliferation
of
technological
tools
and
programming
environments
offers
the
opportunity
for
creative
coding
activities
for
children
and
increases
the
need
for
appropriate
instructional
practices
in
this
study
we
design
and
evaluate
a
coding
workshop
for
children
our
goal
is
to
examine
differences
between
boys
and
girls
using
eye-tracking
as
an
objective
measure
and
triangulating
the
findings
with
qualitative
data
coming
from
childrens
interviews
the
results
show
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
female
and
male
gaze
and
learning
gain
during
the
coding
activity
interestingly
the
qualitative
data
show
differences
in
the
strategies
and
implemented
practices
during
coding
and
in
perceptions
about
those
coding
activities
our
results
highlight
that
further
studies
need
to
utilize
objective
measures
and
unveil
necessary
differences
in
the
design
and
implementation
of
coding
activities
furthermore
our
results
provide
objective
evidence
that
female
students
do
not
lack
in
competences
compared
to
boys
but
simply
that
they
have
a
different
approach
during
coding
activities
and
different
perspectives
about
coding
an
approach
that
needs
to
be
cultivated
and
nurtured
computational

ct
is
broadly
recognised
as
a
set
of
problem-solving

their

in
ways
that
enable
their
computer-mediated
representation
across
a

nowadays
it
is
argued
that

to
be
expanded
towards
new
pathways
that
establish
a
less
individualistic
and
more
social
ct
one
of
these

consists
of

ct
has
emerged
the

couple
of
years
but
there
is
still
a
lack

about
the

there
are
also
gaps
in
the
understanding
of
how

we
contribute
to
the

by
taking
an
action

shows
how
visual

of
an

and
the
development
of

are
two
important
elements
when
young

students
are
able
to
reduce
the
amount
of

spent
on

and
thus
increase
their

approach
one
theory
created

a
contribution
of
this

we
take
the
first
steps
towards
a
model
for

the
model
has
been
applied
in
the
analysis
of
four
ce-focused

we
propose
that
computational

is
a
matter
of
reaching
a
high
competency
level
regarding

and
reflexivity
regarding
the

finally
by
formulating
examples
of

we
illustrate
how
the

can
be
used
by

domain
linked
to
21st-century
competences
and
educational
robotics
er
is
increasingly
recognised
as
a
tool
to
develop

this
is
why
researchers
recommend
developing
intervention
methods
adapted
to

practice
and
providing
explicit
guidelines
to

on
integrating

activities
the
present
study
thus
addresses
this
challenge
guidance
and
feedback
were
considered
as
critical
intervention
methods
to
foster
ct
competences
in
er
settings
a
between-subjects
experiment
was
conducted
with
66
students
aged
8
to
9
in
the
context
of
a
remote
collaborative
robot
programming
mission
with
four
experimental
conditions
a
two-step
strategy
was
employed
to
report

and
learning
process
firstly
the
students
ct
learning
gains
were
measured
through
a
pre-post-test

secondly
video

was
used
to
identify
the
creative
computational
problem-solving
patterns
involved
in
the
experimental
condition
that
had
the
most
favourable
impact
on
the
students’

scores
results
show
that
delayed
feedback
is
an
effective
intervention
method
for
ct
development
in
er
activities
subject
to
delayed
feedback
students
are
better
at
formulating
the
robot
behaviour
to
be
programmed
and
thus
such
a
strategy
reinforces
the
anticipation
process
underlying
the

are
21st-century
skills
required

the
acquisition
of
computational

and
coding
skills
is
of
special
significance
in
helping
adult
learners
keep
pace
with
a
new
context
where
those
skills
are
required
for
many
parts
of
the
workforce
however
there
is
an
agreement
in
the
scientific
literature
that
important
challenges
exist
such
as
keeping
student
engagement
and
the
requirement
of
developing
problem-solving
skills
and
not
just
learning
the
code
syntax
the
inclusion
of
digital

gbl
has
shown
great
potential
to
better
understand
how
it
can
be
helpful
to
adult
learners
in
stem
degrees
a
study
was
conducted
on
the
application
of
two
very
popular
commercial
video
games
in
different
introductory
programming
courses
at
an
online
university
during
the
introduction
of
basic
programming
topics
cs1
the
methods
combined
a
descriptive
qualitative
and
a
quantitative
approach
using
a
reflective
journals
and
questionnaires
which
helped
students
consider
and
express
their
experiences
how
they
interacted
with
the
games
how
the
games
helped
them
better
understand
the
topics
and
realize
their
personal
progress
and
potential
results
showed
that
the
use
of
these
games
as
educational
resources
had
a
positive
impact
in
their
engagement
and
sense
of
self-efficacy
but
only
if
some
important
instructional
considerations
are
taken
into
account
interest
in
educational
robotics
has
increased
over
the
last
decade
through
various
approaches
robots
are
being
used
in
the
teaching
and
learning
of
different
subjects
at
distinct
education
levels
the
present
study
investigates
the
effects
of
an
educational
robotic
intervention
on
the
mental
rotation
and
computational
thinking
assessment
in
a
3rd
grade
classroom
to
this
end
we
carried
out
a
quasi-experimental
study
involving
24
third-grade
students
from
an
embodied
approach
we
have
designed
a
two-hour
intervention
providing
students
with
a
physical
environment
to
perform
tangible
programming
on
bee-bot
the
results
revealed
that
this
educational
robotic
proposal
aimed
at
map-reading
tasks
leads
to
statistically
significant
gains
in
computational
thinking
moreover
students
who
followed
the
bee-bot-based
intervention
achieved
greater
ct
level
compared
to
students
following
a
traditional
instruction
approach
after
controlling
student’s
prior
level
no
conclusive
results
were
found
in
relation
to
mental
rotation
the
inclusion
of
computational
thinking
ct
in
the
classroom
is
something
that
the
present
and
future
society
is
demanding
however
this
domain
remains
largely
unexplored
especially
in
the
first
years
of
primary_education
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
evaluate
whether
the
inclusion
of
the
so-called
unplugged_activities
favours
the
development
of
ct
in
the
students
of
the
early
years
of
primary_education
to
this
end
a
quasi-experimental
study
has
been
carried
out
to
explore
the
eventual
benefit
of
a
mixed
approach
that
combines
both
unplugged
and
plugged-in
activities
in
particular
84
second-grade
students
took
part
in
the
experiment
three
questions
were
evaluated
the
development
of
their
ct
skills
their
motivation
towards
the
proposed
instruction
and
the
influence
of
students
gender
in
the
two
previous
areas
the
intervention
was
designed
on
a
selection
of
activities
extracted
from
codeorg
courses
and
was
divided
into
two
phases
one
in
which
one
group
worked
with
unplugged_activities
and
the
other
with
plugged-in
activities
and
a
second
where
both
groups
worked
with
plugged-in
activities
analysing
the
three
proposed
questions
through
tests
performed
before
in
between
and
after
the
instruction
it
is
concluded
that
the
inclusion
of
unplugged_activities
in
the
instruction
seems
beneficial
taking
into
account
ct
motivation
and
gender
as
the
definition
of
computational
thinking
ct
in
education
continues
to
evolve
researchers
have
investigated
the
integration
of
ct
in
k-12
learning
contexts
and
students
perceptions
and
development
of
ct
in
these
integrated
learning
experiences
drawing
on
prior
work
this
study
explored
the
evolution
of
two
elementary_school
girls’
conceptions
and
practices
of
ct
in
science
as
they
participated
in
a
four-week
ct-integrated
science
unit
at
a
summer
camp
using
the
dash
robot
and
the
blockly
app
three
ct
concepts
loops
sequences
and
conditionals
were
integrated
into
a
unit
on
the
reproduction
cycle
of
flowerless
plants
observations
participant
drawings
and
analysis
of
blockly
code
revealed
that
the
children
improved
in
their
ct
practices
in
addition
the
ct-integrated
science
unit
developed
for
this
study
successfully
engaged
both
participants
even
when
one
expressed
a
low
interest
in
science
the
study
suggested
that
defining
computing
vocabulary
using
checkpoint
activities
with
immediate
and
corrective
feedback
and
scaffolding
of
coding
concepts
with
unplugged_activities
were
particularly
necessary
in
promoting
ct
and
the
integration
of
ct
and
science
education
in
an
elementary-level
informal
learning
context
this
study
compared
the
pedagogical
effects
of
educational
robot
development
and
the
block-based
programming
perspectives
which
are
used
in
programming
education
on
middle

students
its
participants
were
78
sixth

were
assigned
to
the
experimental

and
40
students
were
assigned
to
the
control
group
which
studied
with

environment
scratch
all
the
topics
of
the
programming
unit
which
are
shown
in
the
methods
section
were
taught
to
both
groups
for
10
weeks
using
the
two
different
approaches
the
change
created
by
the
implementation
between
the
groups
was
tested
for
academic
achievement
computational

levels
the
results
indicate
that
educational
robotics
develop
middle
school
students’
academic
achievement
and
computational

skill
efficacy
perceptions
more
effectively
than
block-based
programming
environments
the
connections
between
the
concepts
of
the
students
who
did
robotics
were
also
found
to
be
more
solid
than
those
who
worked
with
block-based
software
the
study
examined
the
effects
of
learning
with
the
bee-bot
on
young
boys
and
girls
computational
thinking
within
the
context
of
two
scaffolding
techniques
the
study
reports
statistically
significant
learning
gains
between
the
initial
and
final
assessment
of
childrens
computational
thinking
skills
also
according
to
the
findings
while
both
boys
and
girls
benefited
from
the
scaffolding
techniques
a
statistically
significant
interaction
effect
was
detected
between
gender
and
scaffolding
strategy
showing
that
boys
benefited
more
from
the
individualistic
kinesthetic
spatially-oriented
and
manipulative-based
activity
with
the
cards
while
girls
benefited
more
from
the
collaborative
writing
activity
in
regards
to
the
childrens
problem-solving
strategies
during
debugging
the
results
showed
that
the
majority
of
them
used
decomposition
as
a
strategy
to
deal
with
the
complexity
of
the
task
these
results
are
important
because
they
show
that
children
at
this
very
young
age
are
able
to
cope
with
the
complexity
of
a
learning
task
by
decomposing
it
into
a
number
of
subtasks
that
are
easier
for
them
to
tackle
the
research
contributes
to
the
body
of

has
practical
significance
for

article
briefly
presents
the

we
highlight
the
potential
of
the
eye

perspectives
in
conclusion
we
suggest
that
an

is
thus
to

the
method
applied
is
one
of

how
the
power
of

is
a
matter

has
been
increasingly
used
in

shows
many
potentials
for

is
encouraged
to
better

additionally
there
is
also
a

in
the
present

efforts
have
been
made
to
create
a

developed
which
allows
fine-tuning
the

as
known
the
central
issues
for
knowledge-based
systems
are
what’s-in-a-node
and
what’s-in-a-link
as
shown
the
answer
can
be
obtained
from
the
functor-as-object
representation
then
the

are
functors
and
the
main

are
natural
transformations
such
a
model
is
applicable
to
represent
morphing
and
the
object
is
considered
as
a

which
is
in
a
harmony
with
current

it
is

problem
of

are
designed
to
enhance

while
safeguarding
their

a
critical
aspect
of
this

is
the
assessment
of

a
growing
concern
in

the
findings
reveal
that

underscores
the
importance
of

to
equipping
all

with
the

this

while

little

has
dealt
with
the
strategic
challenge
of
developing

implementing
a
digital

subject
in
k-12
education
in
this
paper
we
explore
how
to
develop
implement
and
sustain
a
national
program
on
technology
comprehension
by
analyzing
the
newly
established
danish
knowledge
center
for
digital

comprehension
we
draw
on
the
concept
of
infrastructuring
to
shed
light
on
how
to
create
and
sustain
the
social
material
political
and
organizational
structures
that
form
the
basis
for
introducing
the
new
national
initiative
based
on
our
case
we
distill
seven
propositions
that
describe
more
generally
how
to
work
strategically
with
this
challenge
digital
education
including
digitally
supported
education
is
loaded
with
biases
most
participants
are
blinded
by
the
abundance
of
digital
devices
and
misled
by
the
hardware
and
software
providers
who
try
to
convince
and
force
education
systems
to
keep
track
of
untraceable
developments
however
recent
studies
have
revealed
that
the
productivity
of
the
participants
and
the
sustainability
of
their
digital
artifacts
generate
a
huge
but
silent
waste
both
in
terms
of
human
and
machine
resources
this
contradiction
generates
a
paradox
in
which
the
illusion
of
digital
prosperity
does
not
allow
us
to
clearly
see
the
ineffectiveness
of
digital
processes
and
artifacts
and
the
losses
piling
up
our
research
revealed
that
the
methodology
of
lean
thinking
allows
us
to
find
the
root
causes
of
the
problems
and
the
revolutionary
changes
which
must
be
applied
to
eliminate
the
waste
generated
by
the
participants
in
the
digital
era
it
was
also
found
that
the
adaptation
of
the
lean
philosophy
proven
effective
in
production
services
and
administration
can
be
a
solution
in
resolving
the
paradox
of
digital
education
which
leads
us
to
lean
digital
education
lde
within
this
framework
–
instead
of
the
widely
accepted
tool-centered
ideas
–
we
offer
a
human-centered
long-term
thinking
philosophy
focusing
on
respect
for
participants
on
their
development
tasks
and
problems
while
at
the
same
time
eliminating
and
reducing
waste
the
present
paper
details
the
strength
of
this
innovative
approach
which
is
based
on
1
a
solid
theoretical
background
2
a

we
attend
not

also
to
its

under
these
circumstances
timely

becomes
a
matter
of
scientific

during
the
covid-19
pandemic
the
transformative
potential
of
genomic
pathogen
data

became
obvious
and
advanced
the
debate
on
data
sharing
however
when
the
genomic
sequencing

of
the
omicron
b11529
variant
was
shared
and
announced
by
scientists
in
southern
africa
various
challenges
arose
including
travel
bans
the
scientific
economic
and
moral
impact
was
catastrophic
yet
travel
restrictions
failed
to
mitigate
the
spread
of
the

already
present
in

public
perceptions
of
the

are
detrimental
to
the
willingness
of

into
technological
literacy
where
the
latter
is
viewed
as
a
multiliteracy
this
study
thus
aims
to
critically
analyse
and
discuss
different
components
of
ai
literacy
found
in
the
literature
in
relation
to
technological
literacy
the
data
consists
of
five
ai
literacy
frameworks
related
to
three
traditions
of
technological
knowledge
technical
skills
technological
scientific
knowledge
and
socio-ethical
technical
understanding
the
results
show
that
ai
literacy
for
technology
education
emphasises
technological
scientific
knowledge
eg
knowledge
about
what
ai
is
how
to
recognise
ai
and
systems
thinking
and
socio-ethical
technical
understanding
eg
ai
ethics
and
the
role
of
humans
in
ai
technical
skills
such
as
programming
competencies
also
appear
but
are
less
emphasised
implications
for
technology
education
are
also
discussed
and
a
framework
for
ai
literacy
for
technology
education
is
suggested
block
construction
is
ubiquitous
in
early
development
yet
is
surprisingly
complex
involving
step-by-step
sequenced
actions
to
create
specific
structures
here
we
use
novel
analytic
methods
to
characterize
these
action
sequences
in
detail
including
which
individual
parts
of
the
structure
‘states’
are
built
and
how
these
structures
are
combined
creating
a
fully
specified
build
path
towards
the
final
structure
we
find
that
like
adults
tested
in
a
previous
study
4-
to
8-year-olds
build
by
creating
a
small
subset
of
possible
individual
states
and
full
build
paths
and
that
they
prioritize
building
layer-by-layer
the
individual
states
and
build
paths
that
children
produce
are
strikingly
similar
to
those
of
adults
resulting
in
structures
that
are
more
stable
than
other
possible
but
not
attested
states
and
paths
our
approach
serves
as
a
lens
into
the
cognitive
processes
underlying
block
building
and
suggests
that
children’s
building
is
guided
by
significant
cognitive
constraints
consistent
with
“computational
thinking”

notably
there
are
no
studies
in

although
africans
possess
unparalleled
human
genetic
diversity
including
the
earliest
diverged
mitochondrial

and
a
high

this
underrepresentation
limits
the
discovery
of

in

we
describe
the
unique

during

infection
and
summarise
published
studies
that
investigate
the
role
of

variation
in

we
further
advocate
for
the
inclusion
of

we
conducted
a

declined
from

just
over

several
gaps
exist
in
the
literature
on

focused
on
early
elementary_school
students
in
addition
close
description
of
the
overall
context
of

tasks
at
this
level
is
rare
further
there
is
a
need
for
both
teacher
and
student
voices
around
coding
experiences
to
be
heard
moreover
a
task
engagement
framework
has
not
been
used
to
evaluate
the

of

therefore
an

was
used
to
investigate
student

of

in

to
fill

in

artificial
intelligence
ai
has
only
partially
or
not
at
all
been
integrated
into
medical
education
leading
to
growing
concerns
regarding
how
to
train
healthcare
practitioners
to
handle
the
changes
brought
about
by
the
introduction
of
ai
programming
lessons
and
other
technical
information
into
healthcare
curricula
has
been
proposed
as
a
solution
to
support
healthcare
personnel
in
using
ai
or
other
future
technology
however
integrating
these
core
elements
of
computer
science
knowledge
might
not
meet
the
observed
need
that
students
will
benefit
from
gaining
practical
experience
with
ai
in
the
direct
application
area
therefore
this
paper
proposes
a
dynamic
approach
to
case-based
learning
that
utilizes
the
scenarios
where
ai
is
currently
used
in
clinical
practice
as
examples
this
approach
will
support
students
understanding
of
technical
aspects
case-based
learning
with
ai
as
an
example
provides
additional
benefits
1
it
allows
doctors
to
compare
their
thought
processes
to
the
ai
suggestions
and
critically
reflect
on
the
assumptions
and
biases
of
ai
and
clinical
practice
2
it
incentivizes
doctors
to
discuss
and
address
ethical
issues
inherent
to
technology
and
those
already
existing
in
current
clinical
practice

it
serves
as
a
foundation
for
fostering
interdisciplinary
collaboration
via
discussion
of
different
views
between
technologists
multidisciplinary
experts
and
healthcare
professionals
the
proposed
knowledge
shift
from
ai
as
a
technical
focus
to
ai
as
an
example
for
case-based
learning
aims
to
encourage
a
different
perspective
on
educational
needs
technical
education
does
not
need
to
compete
with
other
essential
clinical
skills
as
it
could
serve
as
a
basis
for
supporting
them
which
leads
to

however
somewhat

vital
for
software
documentation
they
provide
necessary
insights
and
assist
developers
in
understanding
and
maintaining
the
software
due
to
their
importance
comments
have
been
extensively
studied
and
much
has
been
learned
about
them
these
existing
studies
have
predominantly
focused
on
text-based
languages
conversely
block-based
visual
programming
languages
particularly
scratch
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
some
studies
regarding

focus
on
topics
such
as
fostering

etc
however
they
overlook
the
visual

this
is

interest
in
robotics
usage
to
develop
such
competencies
in
educational
settings
arises
but
there
hasnt
been
so
far
mapping
of
the
research
conducted
in
this
field
thus
we
present
a
scoping
review
of
59
articles
published
from
2012
to
2023
in
4
databases
and
2
registers
examining
kindergarteners
skills
through
educational
robotics
our
goal
was
to
map
which
skills
are
commonly
examined
in
kindergarten
and
under
which
terminology
as
well
as
to
investigate
the
studies
features
the
types
of
robotics
and
the
assessment
tools
utilized
our
findings
depict
that
several
skills
are
evaluated
using
different
terms
critical_thinking
is
examined
most
frequently
creativity
the
least
and
communication
is
integrated
into
collaboration
and
the
opposite
most
of
the
researchers
used
the
mixed
method
focusing
on
qualitative
tools
examining
quite
a
small
sample
size
and
conducting
the
intervention
for
a
short
time
also
bee_bot
lego
robotics
kits
wedo
mindstorms
and
social
humanoid
robots
are
often
used
additionally
the
evaluation
tools
used
in
the
reviewed
papers
are
presented
and
categorized
into
groups
this
scoping
demonstrates
that
robotics
might
affect
positively
the
childrens
cognitive
skills
and
creativity
but
may
not
facilitate
their
interactions
so
much
regarding
emotional
expressions
moreover
a
gap
in
quantitative
research
on
kindergarteners
skills
development
via
educational
robotics
is
spotted
finally
this
scoping
review
suggests
creating
clear
terms
for
skills
developing
robotics
tailored
to
kindergarten
age
forming
full
robotics
activities
and
designing
modular
evaluation
tools
for
young
learners
capacities
storytelling
has
been
used
for
years
in
educational
practice
and
educational
robotics
is
a
rapidly
growing
field
worldwide
accordingly
researchers
have
attempted
to
combine
storytelling
and
robotics
in
education
however
no
systematic
record
exists
on
this
combination
therefore
we
conducted
a
scoping
review
of
82
papers
out
of
5272
articles
published
in
5
databases
in
the
last
20
years
to
map
the
conducted
research
so
far
in
detail
the
educational
levels
and
the
school
subjects
in
which
storytelling
and
educational
robotics
are
applied
the
types
of
robots
used

age
and
the
skills
that
students
may
develop
through
this
combination
additionally
we
analyzed
grouped
and
presented
the
tools
used
for
measuring
the
potential
effects
of
storytelling
and
educational
robotics
finally
the
students
role
in
the
activities
was
sought
based
on
our
findings
most
interventions
mainly
addressed
preschool
and
primary_school
students
the
robots
used
the
most
are
humanoid
most
interventions
did
not
exceed
6
h
and
the
number
of
participants
was
less
than
20
students
besides
most
interventions
tried
to
develop
students’
skills
communication
creativity
collaboration
and
attitudes
engagement
motivation
participation
with
qualitative
tools
borrowed
from
other
domains
eg
psychology
healthcare
this
scoping
demonstrates
a
gap
in
the
use
of
storytelling
and
educational
robotics
in
secondary
and
university
education
and
subjects
like
history
geography
etc
finally
this
combination
seems
to
have
the
potential
to
enhance
the
educational
process
but
more
research
is
needed
to
shed
light
on
all
the
aspects
of
the
combination
in
this
digital
age
where
machine
learning
has
won
the
nobel
prizes
in
both
physics

it
is
ever

aims
to
analyze
the

findings
revealed
both
the
advantages

usage
as
perceived
by
the

the
students
stated
that
the
main
benefits
of
using

are
providing
fast
and
mostly
correct
answers
to
questions
improving
thinking
skills
facilitating

and
increasing
self-confidence
on

hand
the
main
limitations
of

education
were
getting
students
used
to
laziness
being
unable

answer
some
questions
or

based
on
the
results
of
the

it
can
be
said
that
it
would
be
useful
to
integrate
generative

considering
the
advantages
they
provide
in

however
appropriate
measures
should
be
taken
regarding
the
limitations
it
brings
based
on
the

findings
several
recommendations
were
proposed

has
significantly
heightened
interest
in

has
had
an
important
impact
in
recent
years
as
it
offers
a
number
of
advantages
for
students
the
inclusion
of
robotics
in
any
educational
stage
requires
teachers
with
adequate
predisposition
and
training
making
it
necessary
to
know
the
opinions
of
pre-service

the
aim
of
our
study
is
to
analyze
the
perceptions

self-confidence
of
109

before
and
after
an
intervention
based
on

in
their
third

a
quasi-experimental
design
was
used
involving
pretest

using
the
nonparametric
mann-whitney

tests
the
results
showed
a
significant
improvement
in
the
overall

self-confidence
in
addition
the
intervention
led
to
a
more
positive
perception
of
the
benefits
and
possibilities
of
robotics
for
teaching
of
scientific
and
mathematical
content
although
it
also
increased
the
difficulties
of
implementation
due
to
the
lack
of
training
in
this
digital
resource
it
is
concluded
that
interventions
are
required
based
on
educational
robotics
that
allow
pre-service
teachers
to
gain
the
necessary
self-confidence
and
perception
to
facilitate
its
introduction
for
the
teaching
of
scientific

mathematical
content
with
the
rapid
development
of
the

is
also
highlighted
as

facing
one
possible
way
to
establish

is
useful
to
create

that
provide
educational

methods
starting
from
students’
perspective
we
created
a

where
students
got
an
opportunity
to
self-assess
their
knowledge
in
computer

in
this
commentary
we
make
a
case
for
the
explicit
inclusion
of
combinatorial
topics
in
mathematics
curricula
where
it
is
currently
essentially
absent
we
suggest
ways
in
which
researchers
might
inform
the
field’s
understanding
of
combinatorics
and
its
potential
role
in
curricula
we
reflect
on
five
decades
of
research
that
has
been
conducted
since
a
call
by
kapur
1970
for
a
greater
focus
on
combinatorics
in
mathematics
education
specifically
we
discuss
the
following
five
assertions
1
combinatorics
is
accessible
2
combinatorics
problems
provide
opportunities
for
rich
mathematical
thinking
3
combinatorics
fosters
desirable
mathematical
practices
4
combinatorics
can
contribute
positively
to
issues
of
equity
in
mathematics
education
and
5
combinatorics
is
a
natural
domain
in
which
to
examine
and
develop
computational
thinking
and
activity
ultimately
we
make
a
case
for
the
valuable
and
unique
ways
in
which
combinatorics
might
effectively
be
leveraged
within
k-16
curricula
this

investigates
how

a
micro-analytic
video
study
was
conducted
of
primary_school
children
designing
their
own

using

our
investigation
reveals
that
the
roles
feedback
plays
in
children’s
interactions
cannot
easily
be
assimilated
within
the
existing
approaches
to
understand
feedback
that
have
been
articulated
in
hci
literature
our
qualitative
analysis
shows
how
children
do
not
make
sense
of
feedback
as
semantic
communication
from
the
system
but
make
sense
of
it
with
respect
to
its
embeddedness
in
a
sequence
of
activities
they
are
performing
with
the
system
and
each
other
the
principal
contribution
to
emerge
from
our
study
is
a
conception
of
feedback
as
a
process
rather
than
as
a
semantic
communicative
event
nor
a
direct
coupling
of
action
and
system

our
discussion
identifies
how

participates
in

368
representational
gestures
were
identified
across

explanations
thereby
providing
evidence
that
offline
thinking
in
this
domain
is
embodied
our
analysis
of
representational
gestures
showed
that
participants
drew
upon
two
overarching
embodied
metaphors
in
their
explanations
1
computing
constructs
as
physical
objects
in
which
participants
simulated
manipulating
physical
objects
eg
pinching
when
referring
to
range
of
computing
constructs
and
2
computing
processes
as
motion
along
a
path
whereby
participants
moved
their
hands
along
one
of
three
body-based
axes
when
referring
to
temporal
sequences
we
contrast
our
findings
to
similar

metacognition
and
advanced
technologies
presents
a
frontier
with
profound
implications
for
human
learning
and
artificial
intelligence
this
paper
traces
the
historical
roots
of
these
concepts
from
the
pythagoreans
and
aristotle
to
modern
cognitive
science
and
explores
their
relevance
to
contemporary
technological
applications
we
examine
how
the
pythagoreans
view
of
mathematics
as
fundamental
to
understanding
the
universe
and
aristotles
contributions
to
logic
and
categorization
have
shaped
our
current
understanding
of
mathematical
cognition
and
metacognition
the
paper
investigates
the
role
of
boolean
logic
in
computational
processes
and
its
relationship
to
human
logical
reasoning
as
well
as
the
significance
of
bayesian
inference
and
fuzzy
logic
in
modelling
uncertainty
in
human
cognition
and
decision-making
we
also
explore
the
emerging
field
of
chemical
artificial
intelligence
and
its
potential
applications
we
argue
for
unifying
mathematical
metacognition
with
advanced
technologies
including
artificial
intelligence
and
robotics
while
identifying
the
multifaceted
benefits
and
challenges
of
such
unification
the
present
paper
examines
essential
research
directions
for
integrating
cognitive
sciences
and
advanced
technologies
discussing
applications
in
education
healthcare
and
business
management
we
provide
suggestions
for
developing
cognitive
robots
using
specific
cognitive
tasks
and
explore
the
ethical
implications
of
these
advancements
our
analysis
underscores
the
need
for
interdisciplinary
collaboration
to
realize
the
full
potential
of
this
integration
while
mitigating
potential
risks
the
ubiquity
of
smartphone
and
tablet
devices
combined
with
the
increasing
availability
of
serious
games
has
enabled
students
to
learn
various
abstract
concepts
in
an
appealing
and
convenient
manner
while
several
researchers
have
explored
the
use
of
augmented
reality
ar
in
serious
games
many
of
these
games
have
not
been
critically
explained
or
evaluated
to
that
end
we
employed
game-based_learning
methodologies
and
game
learning
analytics
gla
to
systematize
the
design
and
evaluation
of
an
ar-based
serious
game
to
teach
programming
we
evaluated
our
game
for
usability
and
effectiveness
by
conducting
a
user
study
on
twenty-seven
undergraduate
students
the
evaluation
primarily
consisted
of
a
learning
test
conducted
twice
–
before
and
after
playing
the
game
–
along
with
a
usability
questionnaire
that
players
completed
after
playing
the
game
our
results
showed
that
players
made
significant
progress
after
playing
the
game
the
game
helped
players
improve
their
basic
programming
skills
especially
for
the
group
having
lower
prior
programming
skills
the
results
highlighted
various
ways
in
which
gla
can
be
used
to
benefit
different
stakeholders
in
the
game
based
on
players’
qualitative
responses
we
also
identified
several
areas
of
improvement
most
prominently
the
trade-off
between
ease
of
use
and
game
complexity
we
provide
suggestions
and
discuss
implications
for
future
work
computational
activity
is
now
recognized
as
a
natural
science
and
computational
and
information
processes
have
been
discovered
in
the
deep
structures
of
many
areas
computations
in
the
natural
world
were
present
long
before
the
invention
of
computers
but
a
remarkable
shift
in
understanding
its
fundamental
nature
occurs
in
fact
before
our
eyes
the
present
moment
in
fact
is
a
transition
from
the
concept
of
computer
science
as
an
artificial
science
to
the
understanding
that
information
processes
are
abundant
in
nature
computing
is
recognized
as
a
natural
science
that
studies
natural
and
artificial
information
processes
in
everyday
computing
operations
are
performed
on
the
individual
generators
with
little
attention
paid
to
their
internal
structure
however
many
common
operations
consist
of
more
primitive
constructions
connected
by
a
combination
mode
the
interaction
of
information
processes
and
corresponding
structures
is
carried
out
in
an
environment
of
“applicative
interaction”
their
applications
to
each
other
and
the
study
of
the
properties
of
this
environment
allows
us
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
computations
in
the
present
work
the
main
attention
is
paid
to
elucidating
the
technological
features
of
computations
with
individual
generators
or
objects
their
interaction
is
considered
in
an
applicative
environment
which
allows
us
to
elucidate
the
internal

allows
us
to
understand
their
properties
the
choice
of
initial
constant
generators
considered
as
generic
ones
and
expressed
by
combinators
is
discussed
these
initial

are
used
as
the
main
“building
blocks”
that
occur
within
the
larger
blocks
of
the
applicative
environment
in
interaction
with
each

as
a
result
of
the

which
would
be
deemed
‘creative’
if

historically
this

is
a

ai
and
thus
is
a
technological
problem
however
as
will
be
seen
even
in
the
specifically
technological
realm
of
computational

issues
pertaining
to
human

cannot
be
evaded
since
at

the
criteria
for
judging
and
evaluating
the
creativity
of
computational

will
originate
in
the
realm
of
human
creativity
in
recent

the
spike
in
the

as
a
result

therefore
it
is
of

in
programming
education
through
a

conducted
on
21

gamification
has
the
largest
effect
on
students
motivation
followed
by
academic

whereas
it
has
the
least
effect
on

game
is
most
effective
on
academic

while
the
puzzle

is
most
effective
on
motivation
as
for
gamification
application
the
games
as
a
competitive
mechanism
has
the
greatest
impact
on
students’
thinking
skills
and
motivation
however
when
games
were
adopted
as
teaching
tools
or

works
the
effects
are
mainly
represented
in
academic
achievement
pedagogical

have
a
limited
effect
on

the
effect
of

is
more
pronounced
in

education
has
gained
much
importance
in
the
last
few
decades
this
article
primarily
discusses
the
challenges
of
preparing
proficient
stem

that
can
be
accounted
for
by
the
encompassing
nature
of
stem
education
the
availability
of
teacher
training
models
in
the
field
and
a
need
for
developing
stem-related
technological

knowledge
suggestions
to
address
the
challenges
are
provided
many
stakeholders
have
suggested
that
if
girls
are
not
engaged
in
computer
science
at
an
early
age
the
field
of
computer
science
cs
and
computing-related
fields
will
continue
to
lack
gender
diversity
we
need
more
explorations
of
how
curriculum
impacts
girls’
interest
in
computer
science
at
the
elementary
level
the
focus
of
this
research
project
was
to
examine
how
an
elementary
problem-based_learning
pbl
curriculum
impacted
girls’
understanding
of
and
interest
in
cs
by
utilizing
a
curriculum
focused
on
a
problem
that
emphasized
social
activism
we
hypothesized
that
pbl
cs
could
increase
interest
in
cs
for
girls
this
study
used
a
mixed-method
sequential
explanatory
research

to
examine
the
implementation
of
a
cs
pbl
curriculum
with
four
6th

were
calculated
using

the
qualitative
data
was
analyzed
using
a
thematic
approach
that
required
four
researchers
to
come
to
a
consensus
results
suggested
that
although
girls
had
less
understanding
of
cs
at
the
beginning
by
the
end
of
the
curriculum
girls
and
boys
performed
similarly
however
there
were
still
elements
that
were
not
successful
girls’
attitudes
towards
computer
science
were
significantly
lower
than
the
boys
at
the
end
of
the
curriculum
conceptually
the
curriculum
needs
to
specifically
address
how
cs
could
impact
values
held
by
girls
teaching
programming
logic
to
students
who
do
not
have
a
background
in
computer
science
is
challenging
as
the
instructor
has
to
awaken
problem-solving
critical_thinking
and
logical
reasoning
skills
several
programming
tools
have
been
created
to
teach
coding
concepts
to
computer

students
of
different
ages
however
these
tools
are
not
well
designed
to
meet
the
challenge
of
teaching
programming
to
new
developers
who
come
with
school
training
in
other
areas
such
as
accounting
management
etc
therefore
this
research
focused
on
analyzing
the
importance
of
the
application
of
online
programming
tools
to
students
starting
college
who
come
with
a
school
background
in
an
area
other
than

was
carried
out
with
82
first-level
students
of
the
technical
university
of
ambato
in
the
careers
of
systems
and
electronics
the
results
revealed
that
45
of
the
students
increased
their
levels
of
application
and
analysis
in
programming
processes
in
addition
the
research
revealed
that
students
who
come
from
a
background
other
than
computer
science
agree
with
the
integration
of
online
programming
tools
from
the
first
level
of

entrance
since
this
method
helps
to
improve
their

capacity
critical_thinking
is
often
regarded
as
one
of
the
vital

become
important
to
combine
this

this

further
develops
this

to
represent

at
the

this

positions
stem

as
an

and
argues
for

approaches
the

does
present
challenges
for

these
two

we
uncover
the
solution
space
of
a
five

geometry
which
we
deem
it
as
the
direct
counterpart
of
the

v
cosmological
model
we
kinematically
reduce
the
scale
factor
matrix
and
then
with
an
appropriate
scaling
and
choice
of
time
we
cast
the
spatial
equations
into
a
simple
“kasner”
like
form
thus
revealing
linear
integrals
of
motion
their
number
is
enough
so
that
along
with
the
quadratic
constraint
it
suffices
to
scan
the
entire

of

the
latter
is
revealed
to
be
quite
rich
containing
cosmological

some
of
which
admit

digital
game
making
is
becoming
an
increasingly
common
means
of
learning
in
schools
due
to
the
appeal
of
delivering
curriculum-based
learning
objectives
while
tapping
into
the
popularity
of
videogames
indeed
research
suggests
that
digital
game
making
may
improve
cognitive
and
behavioral
skills
in
learners
and
this
may
have
significant
impact
on
learners
with
special
education
needs
and
disabilities
send
however
past
work
in
digital
game
making
has
limited
involvement
with

focuses
on
short-term
evaluations
and
is
utilised
during

approach
furthermore
there
is
little
quantitative

that
demonstrate
the
impact
of
digital

results
suggest
that
digital

is
at

as
effective
in
encouraging
engagement
and

when
compared
to
traditional
methods
with
it
being
more
engaging
for

contributions
from
this

provide
quantifiable
evidence
for
the
perceived
benefits
of
using

recommendations

online
learning

increased
in

driven
by
the
covid-19
pandemic
as
many
researchers
attempted
to
understand
the
impact
stress
had
on
the
emotional
behaviours
and
academic
performance
of
students
most
studies
explored
these
pre-
and
during-covid
behaviours
in
the
context
of
brick

institutions
transitioning
to
online

there
is
an
opportunity
to
compare
the
experiences
of
students
in
the
mooc

in
this
period
particularly
in
terms
of
the
difference
of
engagement

behaviours
in
2019
and
2020
in
this
study
we
use
a
dataset
from
adelaidex
between
this
time
period
to
identify
the
most
significant
features
that
impact
student
outcomes
where
previous
machine
learning
approaches
used
singular
features
such
as
student
interaction
or
sentiment
in

we
incorporate
three
feature
categories
of
engagement
semantics
and
sentimentstress
in
an
ensemble
model
is
based
on
voting
and
stacked
methods
to
determining
the
relationship
between
them
and
academic
performance
from
our
results
we
discover
that
sentimentstress
played
little
part
in
academic
performance
and
was
relatively
unchanged
in
online
courses
in
this
dataset
between
2019
and
2020
we
present
two

artificial

ai
has
made
remarkable
strides
giving
rise
to
the
development
of
large
language
models
such
as
chatgpt
the
chatbot
has
garnered
significant
attention
from
academia
industry
and
the
general
public
marking
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
ai
applications
this
work
explores
how
well
chatgpt
can
write
source
code
to
this
end
we
performed
a
series
of
experiments
to
assess
the
extent
to
which
chatgpt
is
capable
of
solving
general
programming
problems
our
objective
is
to
assess
chatgpt’s
capabilities
in
two
different
programming
languages
namely
c
and
java
by
providing
it
with
a
set
of
programming
problem
encompassing
various
types
and
difficulty
levels
we
focus
on
evaluating
chatgpt’s
performance
in
terms
of
code
correctness
run-time
efficiency
and
memory
usage
the
experimental
results
show
that
while
chatgpt
is
good
at
solving
easy
and
medium
programming
problems
written
in
c
and
java
it
encounters
some
difficulties
with
more
complicated
tasks
in
the
two
languages
compared
to
code
written
by
humans
the
one
generated
by
chatgpt
is
of
lower
quality
with
respect
to
runtime
and
memory
usage
since
artificial
intelligence
ai
is
finding
its
way
into
more
and
more
areas
of
everyday
life
improving
the
ai
skills
of
non-experts
is
important
and
will
become
even
more
relevant
in
the
future
while
it
is
necessary
that
children
learn
about
the
possibilities
of
ai
at
an
early
age
adults
in
higher_education
and
beyond
should
also
have
at
least
a
basic
understanding
of
ai
ie
ai
literacy
to
be
able
to
interact
effectively
with
the
technology
to
evaluate
the
current
state
of
the
literature
on
ai
literacy
in
higher
and
adult
education
a
scoping
literature
review
was
conducted
with
the
objective
of
identifying
thematic
foci
and
recent
research
trends
ten
research
databases
were
searched
and
out
of
902
initial
records
30
studies
were
identified
using
predefined
eligibility
criteria
whereof
the
content
was
evaluated
in
the
review
the
results
indicated
that
research
in
this
area
is
still
in
its
infancy
and
needs
refinement
in
terms
of
how
to
define
ai
literacy
in
adult
education
as
well
as
what
content
should
be
taught
to
non-experts
lastly
several
recommendations
for
research
and
practice
are
derived
from
the
results
this

become
mainstream
in

realm
to
expand
the
scope
of

a
comparative

was
conducted
to
examine
how
the
users
perceive
the

created
by
ai

humans
there
is
no
significant
difference
explicitly
but
the
implicit

were
in
favor
of

the
key
discussion
is
the

summary
the
ability
to
use
logical-mathematical
symbols
lms
encompassing
tasks
such
as
calculation
reasoning
and

is
special
to
humans
with
recent

lms
processing
was
suggested
to
build
upon
fundamental
cognitive
systems
through
neuronal
recycling
with
natural
language
processing
and
spatial
cognition
as
key
candidates
this
study
used
meta-analyses
and
synthesized
neural
maps
of
representative
lms
tasks
including
reasoning
calculation
and
mental
programming
to
compare
their
neural
correlates
with
those
of
the
two
systems
our
results
revealed
greater
activation
overlap
and
multivariate
similarity
between
lms
and
spatial
cognition
than
with

hierarchical
clustering
further
indicated
that
lms
tasks
were
indistinguishable
from
spatial
tasks
at
the

level
suggesting
an
inherent

quantum

simply
the

quantum
quantum
biology
focuses
on
those
quantum

that
result
in
properties
of

scale
and

it
has
long
been
argued
that
quantum
effects
are
incompatible
with
biological
systems
due
to
the
likelihood
of
decoherence

nature
is
a
surprising
and
enterprising

is
the
study
of

how
they
might
sustain

even
in
hot

quantum

was
developed
in

anomalous

it
seems
fitting
that
a
great

of
the
progress
made
in

in
the
last
few

has
been
on
the
topic
of

the

a
broad
overview
of
the
current
state
of
this
research
while
the
underlying
quantum
effects
are
often
similar—energy
and
charge
transfer
tunnelling
spin
dynamics—the
biological
contexts
are
varied
and
continue
to
grow
these
contexts
include
enzyme

microtubule

of
the

and
potentially
consciousness
while
there
remain
a
number
of
reservations

further
our

both

advances

might
also
contribute

methods
we
used

we
predicted

over

for
four
scenarios
1
executive

disruption
was
proportional
to
the
country-specific
pepfars
share
of
total
hiv
funding
2
executive
order—realistic
assuming
near-total
system
collapse
due

program
dependencies
and
3–4
waiver
scenarios
where
treatment
was
resumed
after
4
or
after
8
weeks
resumptions
of

accounted
for

the

previous

has
shown
that
executive

can
contribute
to
successful

however
most

did
not
simultaneously
assess
the
role
of
different
specific

therefore
the
aim
of
our

was
to

however
seeing

the

of

that
modify
the
hilbert-einstein

is
here
explored
by

contribution
in

we
investigate
the
phase-space
stability
and
critical
points
of
an
equivalent
scalar
field
representation
that
makes
use
of
a
massive
field
whose
potential
is
function
of
the
topological
correction
to
do
so
we
introduce
to
the
gravitational
action
integral
a
lagrange
multiplier
and
model
the
modified
friedmann
equations
by
virtue
of
new
non-dimensional
variables
we
single
out
dimensionless
variables
that
permit
a

the
hubble
rate
change
of
sign
enabling
regions
in
which
the
hubble
parameter
either
vanishes
or
becomes
negative
in
this
respect
we
thus
analyze
the
various
possibilities
associated
with
a
universe
characterized
by
such
topological
contributions
and
find
the
attractors
saddle
points
and
regions
of
stability
in

the
overall
analysis
is
carried
out
considering
the
exponential
potential
first
and
then
shifting
to
more
complicated
cases
where
the
underlying
variables
do
not
simplify
we
compute
the
eigenvalues
of
our
coupled
differential
equations
and
accordingly
the
stability
of
the
system
in
both
a
spatially-flat
and
non-flat
universe
quite
remarkably
regardless
of
the
spatial
curvature
we
show
that
a
stable
de
sitter-like
phase
that
can
model
current
time
appears
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
entire

suggesting
that
the
model
under

is
unlikely
in

the

educational
robotics
has
become
each

more
present
in
the

nonetheless
often
the
way
in
which

is
introduced
in

has
been
considered
as
unnecessarily
narrow
the
paper
aims
at
widening
the
scope
of

and
expanding
the

possibilities
of
this
field
to
this
end
the
paper
draws
on
the
outcomes
of
two
case
studies
carried
out
with
primary

secondary_school
children
aimed
at
investigating
their
views
about

these
studies
allow
framing
and
identifying
five
themes
we
believe
are
particularly
relevant
to
rethink
the
pedagogy
of
educational
robotics
using
these
themes
as
cornerstones
for
reflection
we
delineate
a
set
of
dimensions
and
paths
to
move
educational
robotics
beyond
the
focus
on
technical
skills
but
instead
explore
its
potential
as
a
boundary

to
involve
children
in
reflective
processes
around
the
ethical
social
and

however
a

is
lacking
to
fill
this

computer
programming
has
reappeared
in
school

with
the
aim
of
transmitting
knowledge

skills
beyond
the

however
there
are
different
ways
of
teaching
this
subject
and
very
few
experimental

compare
plugged-in

the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
highlight
the
impact
of
plugged-in
or
unplugged
learning
on
students
performance
and
subjective
experience
to
this
end
we
designed
an
experimental
study
with
217
primary_school
students
divided
into
two
groups
and
we
measured
their
knowledge
of
computational_concepts
ability
to
solve
algorithmic
problem
motivation
toward
the
instruction
self-belief
and
attitude
toward
science
the
programming
sessions
were
designed
to
be
similar
between
the
two
conditions
only
the
tools
were
different
computers
and
scratch
software
were
used
in
the
plugged-in
group
while
the
unplugged
group
used
paper
instructions
pictures
figurines
and
body
movements
instead
the
results
show
better
learning
performance
in
the
plugged-in
group
furthermore
although
motivation
dropped
slightly
in
both
groups
this
drop
was
only
significant
in
the
unplugged
condition
gender
also
seems
to
be
an
important
factor
as
girls
exhibit
a
lower
post-test
motivation
and
a
lower
willingness
to
pursue
their
practice
in
programming
outside
the
school
context
however
this
effect
on
motivation
was
only
observable
in
the
plugged-in
group
which
suggests
that
educational
programming
software
may
have
a
positive
but
gendered
motivational
impact

in

research
despite
the
multiple
deep
knowledge
tracing
dkt
methods
developed
for
intelligent
tutoring
systems
and
online
learning
environments
there
exists
only
a
few
applications
of
such
methods
in
educational
computer
games
one
key
challenge
is
that
a
player
may
deploy
several
interweaved
and
overlapped
skills
during
gameplay
making
the
assessment
task
nontrivial
in
this
research
we
present
a
generalizable
dkt
approach
called
gamedkt
that
integrates
state-of-the-art
machine
learning
with
domain
knowledge
to
model
the
learners’
knowledge
state
during
gameplay
in
an
attempt
to
monitor
and
trace
their
proficiency
level
for
the
different
skills
required
for
educational
games
our
findings
reveal
that
gamedkt
approach
could
successfully
predict
the
performance
of
players
in
the
coming
game
task
using
the
cross-validated
cnn
model
with
accuracy
and
auc
of
roughly
85
and
0913
respectively
thus
outperforming
the
mlp
baseline
model
by
up
to
14
when
the
performance
of
players
is
forecasted
for
up
to
four
game
tasks
in
advance
results
show
that
the
cnn
model
can
achieve
more
than
70
accuracy
interestingly
this
model
seems
to
be
better
and
faster
at
identifying
local
patterns
and
it
could
achieve
a
higher
performance
compared
to
rnn
and
lstm
in
both
one-step
and
multi-step
prediction
of
learners’
performance
in
game
tasks
whereas
computational
empowerment
is
well
established
in

research
less
effort
has
been
made
to
integrate
this
approach
in
practice
building
on
four
existing
principles
in
child–computer
interaction
namely
closeness
embodied
learning
design
process
and
decoding
we
explore
how
computational
empowerment
can
be
scaffolded
in

this

in
the
article
we
develop
a
framework
for
applying
computational
empowerment
in
formal
educational
contexts
based
on
the
study
we
found
that
computational
empowerment
builds
on
distinct
layers
which
are
these
four
principles
specifically
merging
the
principles
closeness
and
embodied
learning
can
increase
student
engagement
and
motivation
in
the
activities
in
addition
decoding
and
design
process
are
key
principles
for
promoting
student
awareness
of
the
societal
impacts
of
emerging
technologies
based
on
qualitative
data
from
this
intervention
we
discuss
the
opportunities
and
challenges
for
child–computer

in
moving
toward
computational

with
the
rapid
development
of
artificial

and
a
continuously
growing
interest
in
their

there
has
been
significant
growth
in
the

highlight
the

education
artificial

the
use
of
theory
and
simulation
in
undergraduate
education
in
biochemistry
molecular
biology
and
structural
biology
is
now
common
but
the
skills
students
need
and
the
curriculum
instructors
have
to
train
their
students
are
evolving
the
global
pandemic
and
the
immediate
switch
to
remote
instruction
forced
instructors
to
reconsider
how
they
can
use
computation
to
teach
concepts
previously
approached
with
other
instructional
methods
in
this
review
we
survey
some
of
the
curricula
materials
and
resources
for
instructors
who
want
to
include
theory
simulation
and
computation
in
the
undergraduate
curriculum
there
has
been
a
notable
progression
from
teaching
students
to
use
discipline-specific
computational
tools
to
developing
interactive
computational
tools
that
promote
active
learning
to
having
students
write
code
themselves
such
that
they
view
computation
as
another
tool
for
solving
problems
we
are
moving
toward
a
future
where
computational
skills
including
programming
data
analysis
visualization
and
simulation
will
no
longer
be
considered
an
optional
bonus
for
students
but
a
required
skill
for
the
21st
century
stem
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
workforce
therefore
all
physical
and
life
science
students
should
learn
to
program
in
the
undergraduate
curriculum
many
block-based
programming
environments
have
proven
to
be
effective
at
engaging
novices
in
learning
programming
however
most
offer
only
restricted
access
to
the
outside
world
limiting
learners
to
commands
and
computing
resources
built
in
to
the
environment
some
allow
learners
to
drag
and
drop
files
connect
to
sensors
and
robots
locally
or
issue
http
requests
but
in
a
world
where
most
of
the
applications
in
our
daily
lives
are
distributed
ie
their
functionality
depends
on
communicating
with
other
computers
or
accessing
resources
and
data
on
the
internet
the
limited
support
for
beginners
to
envision
and
create
such
distributed
programs
is
a
lost
opportunity
we
argue
that
it
is
feasible
to
create
environments
with
simple
yet
powerful
abstractions
that
open
up
distributed
computing
and
other
widely-used
but
advanced
computing
concepts
including
networking
the
internet
of
things
and
cybersecurity
to
novices
the
paper
presents
the
architecture
of
and
design
decisions
behind
netsblox
a
programming
environment
that
supports
these
ideas
we
show
how
netsblox
expands
opportunities
for
learning
considerably
netsblox
projects
can
access
a
wealth
of
online
data
and
web
services
and
they
can
communicate
with
other
projects
moreover
the
tool
infrastructure
enables
young
learners
to
collaborate
with
each
other
during
program
construction
whether
they
share
their
physical
location
or
study
remotely
importantly
providing
access
to
the
wider
world
will
also
help
counter
widespread
student
perceptions
that
block-based
environments
are
mere
toys
and
show
that
they
are
capable
of
creating
compelling
applications
in
this
way
netsblox
offers
an
illuminating
example
of
how
tools
can
be
designed
to
democratize
access
to
powerful
ideas
in

the
abstract
nature
of
algorithms

the

are
very
popular
however
these
platforms
also
have
some
drawbacks
including
that
they
cannot
be
completely
based
on
the

of

many
students
ignore
the
needs
of
students
in

do
not
adopt
a
more
personalized_learning
style
and
do
not

many
factors
at

such
as

however
whether
this
model
can
finally
satisfy
teachers
and
students
and
how
the
teaching
effect
is
has
become
a
problem
of
concern
we
propose
a
random
forest-based
method
to
evaluate
college
online

this
method
not
only
focuses
on
a
single

factor
but
also
takes
into

the
special
needs
of

and
formulates
different

so
that
the
system
has
not
only
universal

show
that
this

can
improve

this

from

discusses
the
key

for

for

these
key
considerations
altogether
present
an
innovative
pedagogical
model
for

education
in

this
model
argues
that
ai

is
an
organic
part
of
digital
literacy
for
all
citizens
in
an
increasingly
intelligent
society
the
core
ai
knowledge
that
can
be
explored
with

is
using
large

ai
algorithms
can
be
continuously
trained
to
identify
patterns
make
predictions
and
recommend
actions
even
though
with
limitations
based
on
the
theoretical
notions
of
learning-by-making
and
pedagogy-as-relational
an
embodied
culturally
responsive
approach
should
be
used
to
enable
young
childrens
exploration
with
ai
technologies
finally
an
exemplary
curriculum
named
“ai
for
kids”
is
introduced
to
demonstrate
this
pedagogical
model
and
explain
how
educators
can
provide
children
culturally
responsive
inquiry
opportunities
to
interact
with
and
understand
ai
technologies
the
synthesis
of
knowledge
regarding
“why”
“what”
and
“how”
to
do
with
ai
education
for
young
children
informs
a
new
way
to
engage
children
in
stem
and
understanding
the
digital

artificial

spread

however
public
understanding
of

how

is
under-explored
this
vision
poses
upcoming

on
this
note
an
exploratory

was
conducted
to
conceptualize
the

for
a
sound
theoretical
foundation
to
define

and
evaluate

this

for
fostering

we
offer
an
investigation

we
close
with
a
discussion
and
a
call
to
eschew
technocentric

the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
explore
the
influence
of
spatial
visualization
skills
when
students
solve
area
tasks
spatial
visualization
is
closely
related
to
mathematics
achievement
but
little
is
known
about
how
these
skills
link
to

success
we
examined
middle

students’
representations
and
solutions
to
area
problems
both
non-metric
and
metric
through
qualitative
and
quantitative
task
analysis
task
solutions
were
analyzed
as
a
function
of
spatial
visualization
skills
and
links
were
made
between
student
solutions
on
tasks
with
different
goals
ie
non-metric
and
metric
findings
suggest
that
strong
spatial
visualizers
solved
the
tasks
with
relative
ease
with
evidence
for
conceptual
and
procedural
understanding
by
contrast
low
and
average
spatial
students
more
frequently
produced
errors
due
to
failure
to
correctly
determine
linear
measurements
or
apply
appropriate
formula
despite
adequate
procedural
knowledge
a
novel
finding
was
the
facilitating
role
of
spatial
skills
in
the
link
between
metric
task
representation
and
success
in
determining
a
solution
from
a
teaching
and
learning
perspective
these
results
highlight
the
need
to
connect
emergent
spatial
skills
with
mathematical
content
and
support

to
develop
conceptual
understanding

field
is
coupled
to

theory
where
the

in

einstein–scalar–gauss–bonnet
model
the
gauss–bonnet

contributes
to
the

even
when
the

additionally
we
consider
a

coupling
described
by

function
for

we
consider
the
exponential
function
for

function
we
define

write

we
perform

several

however
to
our

none

affect
the

the

suggest
that

furthermore
the

only
we
recommend
to

however
this
requires

our
aim
is
to
discuss
critical
issues
related
to

especially
of
so-called

we
introduce
some
key

last
we
introduce
some
perspectives
on
the

that
point
toward

for
the
future
our
analysis
shows
that
while
there
are
a
number
of
ongoing
initiatives
dedicated
to
developing
instruments
and
curricula
for
assessment
of
21st
century
skills
there
are
also
fundamental
challenges
for
the
development
of
relevant
assessments
on
a
systemic
level
and
for
transforming
practices
related
to
21st

skills
more
broadly
the
lack
of
representation
from
several
parts
of
the
world
in
international
assessment
initiatives
on
21st

skills
is
also
striking
by
taking
a
meta-perspective
we
identify
evolving
themes
within
this
field
and
provide
a
critical
perspective
on
these
developments
we
conclude
there
are
a
number
of
opportunities
and
pitfalls
for
creating
good
synergies
between
21st

this
paper
considers
the
application
of
conceptual
mathematics
to
construct
a
computational
model
of
concepts
and
individuals
an
applicative
approach
is
systematically
applied
to
build
a
concept-as-process
design
since
modern
computing
considers
information
processes
as
the
main
objects
of
modeling
the
developed
design
is
indeed
representative
of
the
semantic
processing
of
information
the
nature
of
concepts
–
what
concepts
are
–
and
the
constraints
that
govern
the
theory
of
concepts
have
been
and
continue
to
be
the
subject
of
debate
it
is
especially
interesting
to
discuss
the
nature
of
concepts
in
connection
with
the
recently
established
fundamental
nature
of
information
processes
that
are
attributable
to
all
phenomena
and
events
occurring
in
the
world
around
us
the
current
trend
elevates
information
processes
to
forms
of
computing
which
can
also
be
implemented
through
practices
for
example
in
the
form
of
programming
the
deep
component
is
computational
models
one
way
or
another
expressed
by
means
of
mathematics
and
metamathematics
the
main
meta-operations
used
are
abstraction
and
application
of
greatest
interest
is
functional
abstraction
and
application
in
the
form
of
applying
a
function
to
an
argument
despite
this
“conceptual
minimalism”
a
rich
theory
of
concepts
can
be
developed
using
this
theory
it
is
possible
to
focus
further
discussion
not
only
on
the
nature
of
concepts
but
also
to
characterize
the
position
on
each
of
the
five
important
issues
that
are
central
to
many
theories
of
concepts
1
ontology
of
concepts
2
structure
of
concepts
3

and
nativism

ict
literacy
is
key
to
solving
future
societal
challenges
and
to
leading
an
independent
and
responsible
life
in
an
increasingly
globalized
and
digitalized
world
hence
countries
around
the
world
have
promoted
research
on
students
ict
skills
and
their
inclusion
in
curricula
despite
these
efforts
little
is
known
about
what
predicts
future
ict
literacy
and
prior
research
has
almost
exclusively
conducted
cross-sectional
studies
in
the
present
study
we
addressed
this
gap
by
using
data
from
a
large-scale
longitudinal
study
of
6810
students
in
311
schools
from
germany
these
students
participated
in
the
national
educational
panel
study
over
the
course
of
secondary_school
in
grades
6
9
and
12
we
were
particularly
interested
in
investigating
potential
spillover
effects
from
skills
and
dispositions
that
are
inherently
fostered
in
school
on
ict
development
thus
we
considered
a
rich
set
of
different
types
of
predictors
related
to
the
students
social
cultural
demographic
and
learning
backgrounds
their
subject-specific
motivation
and
the
composition
of
their
schools
and
we
assessed
the
extent
to
which
these
variables
explained
variation
in
ict
literacy
development
at
two
key
stages
in
the
educational
system
grades
9
and
12
our
results
indicated
that
prior
ict
literacy
was
the
most
important
predictor
of
future
ict
literacy
but
more
so
for
the
development
between
grades
9
and
12
in
addition
variables
related
to
the
students
learning
backgrounds
followed
by
variables
related
to
the
composition
of
their
schools
and
students
subject-specific
motivation
explained
future
ict
literacy
overall
the
predictors
explained
between
49
and
67
of
the
variation
in
future
ict
literacy
our
longitudinal
findings
suggest
that
the
learning
environment
and
students’
skills
and
dispositions
are
crucial
for
understanding
ict
development
and
are
indicative
of
the
deliberate
design
of
ict
interventions

seen
the

investigates
how
ai-based
adaptive

for
13
weeks
with
two

in
one
of
the
groups
tshe
traditional

was
applied
while
in
the
other

tools
were
introduced
in
this
research
methodology
a
mixed-methods
approach
was
adopted
integrating
quantitative
analyses
with
qualitative
data
these
showed
that
the
experimental

demonstrated
significant
improvements
in
learning
results
and
motivation
thereby
realiszing
the
value
of
real-time
personalized
feedback
provided
through
the
ai
system
the
qualitative
findings
revealed
that
with
the
ai
system
there
was
an
increase
in
student
autonomy
thus
there
is
increased
responsibility
among
students
to
collaborate
in
in-class
participation
which
helps
enhance
a
more

these
findings
reveal
important

they
reveal
how

while
this
is
a
step
in

we
investigated
the

remixing
is
a
balance
between
imitation
and
originality
which
gets
a
lot
of
attention
as
an
important
source
of
creative

exploring
the
relationship
between
the

would
provide
a

used
20
projects
and
their
957
remixes
as
samples
to
analyze
creative

in
scratch
through
quantitative
statistics
and
correlation

three
research
questions
are
addressed
1
what
creative

are
there
among
the
remixes
2
what
relationships
are
there
between
the
project
and
its
remixes
and
3
what
creative
trends
are
there
indicated
in
the
remixes
the
main
results
are
concluded
as
follows
first
four
creative
levels
of
remixes
based
on
the
solo
taxonomy
are
found
including
feature
change
appearance
change
element
creation
and
structure
creation
feature
change
has
the
highest
sum
of
remixes
which
indicates
that
most
remixes
are
at
a
low
creative
level
second
the
internal
characteristics
of
projects
are
related
to
the
lower
creative
level
of
remix
while
the
external
characteristics
are
attached
to
the
higher
creative
level
of
remix
finally
the
two-level
three-level
and
four-level
iteration
chain
of
remixes
are
found
in
which
remixes
with
high
creativity
is
more
likely
to
inspire
remixes
with
lower
or
equal
creativity
based
on
these
results
suggestions
for
further
research
and
improvement
are
discussed
this
study
has
important

we
present
the
point-like
lagrangian
that
describes
the
employed

equations
furthermore
we
construct
two
conservation
laws
and
for
different
values
of
these
conserved
quantities
we
analytically
solve
the

the

methods
to

to
parameterized
data
objects
a
data
object
is
an
object
identified
by
standard
methods
including
the
network
identifiers
uri
url
and
urn
the
data
objects
can
be
either
atomic
or
have
a
complex
structure
including
links
to
other
objects
and
this
ensures
the
linking
of
objects
into
a
network
which
can
be
considered
as
an
information
graph
it
turns
out
to
be
possible
to
formulate
a
number
of
criteria
for
supporting
the
integrity
of
such
a
structure
the
paper
proposes
language
tools
to
formulate
such
criteria
an
essential
feature
of
this
network
is
the
dependence
of
the
objects’
information
content
on
a
number
of
parameters
first
of
all
on
time
depending
on
the
parameter
the
information
content
of
the
object
can
change
both
with
the
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
the
structure
and
with
its
damage
the
paper
considers
methods
for
a
parameterized
description
of
objects
while
maintaining
integrity
based
on
the
formalism
of
category
theory
the
formalization
used
allows
defining
two
relations
between
objects
and
their
names

the

studies
the
basic
properties
of
such
relations

for
a

based
on
a

tools
the
proposed
tools
provide
basic
methods
of

to
the

an
essential
feature
of
the

is
the

here
we
discuss
the

challenges
and

facing
the
field
of

in

we
discuss
the
evolving
perception
of
computational

and
its
rise
as
an

domain
in
biomedical
research
while
also
addressing
the
significant

that
arise
from
integrating
computational

additionally
we
discuss
the
future
of
data-centric
research
and
its
applications
across
various
areas
of
the
biomedical
field
in
this
paper
we
present
a
research-through-design

where
we
employed
text-to-text
text-to-image
and
image-to-image
generative
tools
for
a
conceptual

project
for
the

we
trained
these

on
a

that
we
collected
and
curated
consisting
of

we
describe

present
the
final
proposal
reflect
on
the
usefulness
of
such

for
early-stage

and
discuss
implications
for
future
research
and
practice
by
analysing
the
results
from
training
the
text-to-text

we
could
establish
a

informed
the

the

all

way
the

helped
shape

by

we
argue
that
the

takes
a

digital

traditionally
means
limiting
the
effects
on
individuals
of
technology
abuses
however
in
a
broader
perspective
it
can
be
crucial
to
consider
the
pervasiveness
of

and
the
effect
it
can
have
not
only
on
individuals
but
also
on
their
peers
in
the
context
of
diverse
everyday-life
situations
within
this
view
which
emphasises
the
social
side
of
digital
well-being
the
paper
argues
the
need
of
educating
young
generations
to
participate
in
the
making
of
technology
for
a
social
goal
and
have
a
reflective
attitude
towards

engages
them
in
the

and
how
it
acts
as
a
proxy
for
soliciting
their

around

social
digital

while
the
study
of

is
moving
from
a

despite
the

the
topic
of
social

is
still
an
under-researched
area
this
study
adopts
the
theoretical
lens
of
new

studies
to
suggest
a
combined
perspective
for
investigating
social

literacies
this
perspective
considers
both
social

skills
that
are
transversal
across
different
social

global
skills
and
those
that
pertain
to
a
specific
social

examines
practices
that
are
decontextualized

those
that

also
using
a
critical

four
metaphors
whereby
for
learning
purposes
social

are
seen
as
a
tool
as
a
process
as
collaboration
and
as

the
results
show
that
most
of
the
studies
consider
global
social

skills
while
only
a
few
examine
skills

we
conclude
that
there

aied
has

this

highlights
the
necessity

the
current
understanding

qualitative

semi-structured
interviews
with
key
stakeholders
from
two

ertmer’s

applied
to
segregate
the

the
findings
showed
that
both
first-order
and
second-order
barriers
existed
although
they
varied
between
the
cases
it
was
also
found
that
the
barriers
did
not
hinder
in
isolation
but
appeared
to
be
interconnected
the
findings
suggest
that
schools
use
differentiated
strategies
to
tackle

according

their
approach
to
incorporating

moreover
there
is
a

accurate
methods
for
evaluating

is
time-consuming
often
inconsistent
and
prone
to
subjective

explores
the
application
of
large

llms
for
the
automated

we
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
llms
through

the
article
explores
how
teachers
learning

epistemic
practices
of

can
be
supported
the
particular
focus
will
be
on
argumentation
in

as
an

following
a
review
of
the
literature
on
epistemic
practices
including
examples
of
argumentation
modeling
and
explanations
we
focus
on
teachers
learning
of
argumentation
an
important
element
of
teachers
understanding
of
argumentation
in
science
as
an
epistemic
practice
involves
how
they
might
potentially
distinguish
it
from
argumentation
in
other
subject
domains
in
other
words
given
a
broad
set
of
subjects
can
be
considered
from
an
argumentation
perspective
eg
religious
education
history
english
what
differentiates
argumentation
as
an
epistemic
practice
of
science
we
will
address
this
question
by
contrasting
how
argumentation
is
framed
broadly
in
epistemic
practices
of
two
contrasting
school
subjects
science
and
religious
education
following
this
theoretical
account
we
will
then
draw
on
some
empirical
data
from
the
oxford
argumentation
in

project
based
in

to
illustrate
how
in-service

view
argumentation

there
is
a
need
to
develop
task-specific
representational

to
reason
and
conduct
scientific

using
multiple

in
this

we
focus
on
three
representational

linking
between

2
disciplinary
sensemaking
from

and
3
conceptualizing

we
developed
a

environment
with
three
different
representations
and
embedded
it
within
an
online
activity
for
students
to
carry
out
investigations
around
the

the
three
representations
include
a
procedural

a
geometric
representation
of
land
deformation
build-up
and
a
graphical
representation
of

of
students
representational
competencies
and
which
competencies
are
most
correlated
with

results
indicate
that
a

showed
at

however
gender

is
creating
a

that
means
that
for

as
well
as
from
the

social

attacks
target
people
who
lack
awareness
of

these
attacks
have
become
increasingly
threatening
to
modern
software
systems
which
rely
heavily
on
human
interactions
recent
studies
propose
to
conduct
serious
game-based
security
training
against
such
threats
however
it
is
challenging
to
simulate
real-world
scenarios
in
serious

making
the

we
introduce

that
allows
participants
to
play
the
role
of

and
realistically
experience
the
social

attack
process
from
the
attacker’s
perspective
our
game
works
with
state

to
realistically
simulate
stakeholder

and
to
capture

ai
have
also
been
growing
rapidly
and
becoming
more
common
than
ever
before
kenya
has
taken
tremendous
steps
in
adopting
the
use
of
emerging
technology
in
different
sectors
of
the
economy
in
realization
of
the
need
to
have
a
skilled
digital
workforce
to
develop
solutions
using
these
emerging
technologies
kenya
has
undertaken
curriculum
reforms
and
introduced
the
competency-based
curriculum
cbc
which
has
included
digital
literacy
and
coding
in
elementary_school
furthermore
computer
science
has
been
introduced
in
junior
secondary_school
in
view
of
these
changes
teachers
should
be
adequately
prepared
with
knowledge
skills
and
attitudes
to
effectively
teach
these
new
technologies
however
in
kenya
ai
was
not
and
still
is
not
part
of
the
teacher
training
curriculum
additionally
there
are
inadequate
professional
development
opportunities
in
ai
for
both
pre-service
and
in-service
teachers
since
ai
is
not
part
of
the
cbc
curriculum
that
notwithstanding
it
is
inevitable
for
teachers
in
the
current
world
to
introduce

therefore
this

and
the

k-12
in-service
teachers
and
to
assess
how
these
factors
influence
their
readiness
to

this

employed
a

to
a
random
sample
of
308
teachers
from
different

the
findings
showed
that

ai
ethics
and
subjective

significantly
influenced
ai
readiness
while
attitude
towards
ai
and
perceived

did
not
significantly
influence

these
results
are
significant
in
providing
a
basis
for

policy
change
on

education
in
kenya
such
as
transforming
the
teacher
training
curriculum

the

significantly
accelerated
the
digitalization
of

integrating
digital

such
as
platforms

and
virtual

environments
into

worldwide
this
expansion
of
educational

is
intertwined
with
complex
governance
networks
where
new
private

play
an
increasingly
prominent
role
in

visual
diagrammatic
programming
and
block
diagrams
have
been
indispensable
tools
for
systems
modeling
and
simulation
across
research
development
and
educational
fields
for
several
decades
despite
the
availability
of
mature
commercial
and
free
software
tools
there
is
a
lack
of
information
publicly
accessible
on
algorithms
for
processing
block
diagrams
that
represent
dynamical
systems
and
simulate
the
corresponding
models
a
gap
in
the
existing
literature
is
the
absence
of
mathematically
formal
and
complete
proposals
of
algorithms
for
processing
block
diagrams
that
are
multigraphs
containing
directed
cyclic
graphs
and
not
just
simpler
directed
graphs
the
lack
of
a
detailed
exposition
concerning
the
practical
implementation
of
such
algorithms
is
also
a
gap
this
gap
is
likely
because
the
simulation
systems
based
on
block
diagram
descriptions
that
have
become
de
facto
industry
standards
use
proprietary
solutions
even
if
their

can
be
traced

to
work
done
in

more
than
seven

summarizes
the
historical
evolution
of
related
paradigms
such
as
data
flow

bond
graphs
and
block

we
propose
a
general
algorithm
for
block
diagram
processing
and
present
an
open-source
software
tool
for
python
that
implements
a
diagrammatic
visual

the
key
contributions
to
the
field
of
systems
modeling
and
simulation
can
be
summarized
as
follows
firstly
the
exposition
of
the
algorithm
formally
proving
its
correctness
offers
transparency
which
facilitates
further
research
and
development
in
the
field
enabling
academics
and
professionals
to
adapt
enhance
or
expand
upon
the
existing
capabilities
of
the
tool
secondly
the
implementation
of
a
python
library
and
tool
released
as
an
open-source
solution
for
simulating
signal
processing
and
dynamical
systems
through
block
diagrams
by
integrating
the
proposed
algorithm
capable
of
efficiently
handling
multigraph
representations
including
those
with
directed
cyclic
graphs
ensuring
accessibility
of
the
tool
to
researchers
developers
and
educators
fosters
innovation
research
and
empowers
educators
by
providing
them
with
a
versatile
tool
that
can
be
used
to
teach
complex
systems

concepts
in
a
practical

this

began
with
concerns
about

are
increasingly
acknowledged
for
their
potential
to
enrich

childhood
learning
experiences
particularly
in
the
area
of

however
research
has
tended
to

they
engaged
with
three
digital

over
an
eight-week

aims
to
support

cycles
—
the

the
human
agent
is
fed
back
by
the
human
action
on

—
based
on
the
use

we
have
extended
this
concept
in
a
long-term
project
on
socioenactive
systems
by
emphasizing
social

in
the
enactive
phenomena
in
this
article
we
investigate
how
a
robot-based
experience
can
promote
social
behavior
among
children
in
an
educational

the
study
was
conducted
in
workshops
with
26
children
4–5
years

organized
in
two

the
system
scenario
used
a
narrative
based
on
an
adaptation
of
the
little

to
investigate
childrens

our
findings
indicate
that
505
of
the

were
the
result
of
children-children
and
group-robot
interactions
compared
to
the
38
of

this
indicates
childrens
high
degree
of

these

2
in
both
studies
there
were
two
groups
–
sdt-based

revealed
that
in
the
sdt-based
program

the
students
had
a
more
positive
perception
of
ai
learning
and
felt
that
their

were
satisfied
and
2
there
were
non-significant
differences
in
ai

and
between

the
findings
suggest
that
a
focus
on

could
engage
boys

and
high

in
ai

as
they
become
more

initially
the

subsequently
the

finally
a

based

was
proposed
using

the

this

has
the
potential
to
bridge
the
generational

gap
by
promoting
acceptance
motivation
and

to
digital

furthermore
given
the
remote
nature
of
digital
therapeutics
an
individual’s
familiarity
with
required
technologies
and
digital
communication
strongly
influences
their
acceptance
of
digital

and
the
efficacy
thereof
this

can
play
a
pivotal
role
in
enhancing

interestingly
neither

instead
it
was
the

the
studys
findings
reinforce
the
need
to

and
2
identify

there
is
an
increasing
interest
in
human–computer
interaction
in
multisensory
interactive
systems
creating
a
need
to
deepen
our
understanding
of
how
multiple
sensory
modalities
relate
to
and
affect
each
other
we
extend
prior
research
on
crossmodal
correspondences
by
investigating
colour
and
emotional
associations
with
pure
vibrotactile
stimuli
we
asked
32
participants
to
assign
colour
properties
hue
and
brightness
and
emotional
categories
pleasure
arousal
and
dominance
to
stimuli
of
varying
amplitude
and
angular
frequency
we
found
that
perceptions
of
pleasure
and
arousal
increased
with
amplitude
and
angular
frequency
but
negative
and
relaxing
emotional
states
were
not
able
to
convey
we
also
found
associations
between
vibrotactile
stimuli
and
colour
properties
high
amplitude
stimuli
were
linked
to
warm
colours
and
darker
shades
while
low
amplitude
was
associated
with
brighter
shades
and
greater
variance
in
hue
we
finish
by
discussing
the
causal
mechanisms
of
crossmodal
correspondences
and
contribute

the
findings
of
our

reveal
that
ai-assisted
writing
experiences
increase
students
ethical
awareness
of
originality
academic
honesty
and
creativity
improve
their
systematic

skills
in
complex
writing
tasks
and
increase
their
motivation
to

however
the
lack
of
any
study
at
preschool
level
the
limited
number
of
studies
at
primary_school
level
and
the
scarcity
of
qualitative
studies
indicate
that
more
research
is
needed
in
this
field
this
research
examines
whether
critical_thinking
dispositions
significantly
mediate
secondary_school
students’
self-efficacy
and
problem-solving
skills
the
sample
of
the
study
consisted
of
a
total
of

study
data
were
obtained
by
using
the
“problem-solving

and
“middle

it
was
examined
whether
the

were
normally
distributed
after
it
was
understood
that
the

the
relationships
between
the

were
analyzed
with

were
found
between

then
a
mediation
model
was
established
to
analyze
whether
critical_thinking
has
a
mediating
role
in
the
relationship
between
middle

students
self-efficacy
and

the
significance
of
the

model
was
tested
by
the

it
was
concluded
that
all

the
integration
of
artificial

worldwide
is
still
in
its
early

and
undoubtedly
needs
further

there
is
limited
effort
on
understanding

teachers
and
students
in

to
understand
their
conceptions

with
the
aim
of
aiding
the
implementation
of
ai
in

we
further
explored
the
needs
of
the
diverse
stakeholders
how
they
can
be
supported
and
juxtaposed
their
views
to
identify
their
priorities
and
how
their
opinions
combined
could
give
a
holistic
approach
to
the
effective
implementation
of
ai
education
this
research
employed
a
qualitative

what
they
considered

system
concerns
and
support
needed
to
implement
ai
in

the
findings
of
this

contribute
to
the
ongoing

on
how
to

3
draw
out
opportunities
for

research
in
this
specific
area
a
systematic
literature
review
was
conducted
on
five
search
engines
resulting
in
a
set
of
703
articles
which
were
screened
and
filtered
in
a
systematic
way
until
they
were
narrowed
to
a
corpus
of
65
articles
for
further
analysis
the
synthesis
identify
several
key
findings
1
there
is
diversity
of
technology
supports
available
for
children
with
down
syndrome
targeting
individual
capabilities
2
overlapping
definitions
of
technology
makes
it
difficult
to
place
technology
supports
in
individual
categories
rather
than
subsets
of
a
broader
term
3
the
average
sample
size
remained
small
for
participants
in
the
studies
making
it
difficult
to
draw
solid
conclusions
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
related
interventions
4
the
distribution
of
papers
indicates
that
this
is
an
emerging
area
of
research
and
is
starting
to
build
body
of
knowledge
and
5
there
are
limited
studies
on

their
potential

increasingly
being
integrated
into

although
previous
reviews
have
examined
the
impact
of
pas
on

and
learning-related
outcomes
it
still
remains
unclear
what
specific
design
features
social
cues
and
other
contextual
elements
of
pa
implementation
can
optimize
the
learning
process
these
questions
are
even
more
prevalent
with
regards
to
the
k-12
population
as
most
reviews
to
date
have
largely
focused
on
post-secondary
learners
to
address
this
gap
in
the
literature
we
systematically
review
empirical
studies
around
the
design
of
pas
for
k-12
learners
after
reviewing
1374
studies
for
potential
inclusion
we
analyzed
44
studies
that
met
our
inclusion
criteria
using
heidig
and
clarebouts
2011
frameworks
our
findings
showed
that
learners
had
preferences
for
specific
types
of
pas
while
these
preferences
were
not
always
associated
with
increased
learning
outcomes
there
is
a
lack
of
research
specifically
investigating
the
intersection
of
perceptions
and
learning
our
results
also
showed
that
pedagogical
strategies
that
are
effective
for
human
teachers
were
effective
when
used
by
pas
we
highlight
what
specific
design
features
instructional
designers
can
use
to

the

can
contribute
both
to
the
use

transfer
of
the
resources
developed
in
these
projects
and
to
be
able
to
inspire
new
projects
in
those
lines
of

the
main
factors
that
have
contributed
to
the
success
of
the
projects
are
their
usefulness
for
the
educational
community
beyond
the
time
of
funding
the
use
of
innovative
methodologies
applied
with
teachers
and
students
establishing

another
notable
fact
is
the
good
collaboration
and
rapport
between
all
the
project
partners
who
worked
to
get
common
objectives
the
idea
that
learning
and
creativity
are
interrelated
has
experienced
a
renaissance
in
the
last
20
years
fashionable
and
suggestive
the
concept
of
fablearn
is
a
venue
for
researchers
and
practitioners
within
computing
design
and
making
in
education
where
reflective
practices
are
an
integral
part
this
paper
presents
a
systematic
literature
review
on
the
use
of
the
term
reflection
in
fablearn
research
with
this
review
we
provide
an
answer
to
the
questions
1
what
reflection
means
in
fablearn
research
2
how
these
reflections
are
stimulated
and
scaffolded
in
practice
ie
teachersfacilitators
and
studentsparticipants
and
3
what
types
of
concerns
or
subject
matters
take
place
in
reflective
practices
the
review
is
conducted
in
fablearn
us
and
europe
proceedings
between
2014–2019
and
resulted
in
68
papers
included
in
the
analysis
the
findings
show
that
fablearn
research
need
to
develop
solid
theoretical
groundings
and
frameworks
as
guidelines
to
scaffold
students’
reflection
and
more
in-depth
understanding
of
reflection
to
investigate
and
carry
out
a
more
comprehensive
conceptualization
of
the
term
at
present
even
though
gender
equality
is
an
important
matter
of
public
interest
there
are
still
areas
in
higher_education
where
male
presence
is
overwhelming
we
refer
to
stem
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
studies
in
general
and
computer
engineering
in
particular
where
there
is
only
16
of
female
presence
in
spain
this
fact
made
us
think
about
the
reason
for
this
inequality
we
attempted
to
answer
such
questions
by
means
of
a
survey
filled
out
by
138
students
of
stem
university
degrees
thanks
to
this
survey
we
have
been
able
to
understand
the
motivations
and
opinions
of
the
students
of

our
study
highlights
the
possible

furthermore
it
points
out
the
differences
between

to
overcome
the

inspired
by
this
we
propose
a
framework
for
the
automated
assessment
of
hots
using
llms
called
llm4ha
the
framework
consists
of
two
distinct
models
a

constructed
from
pre-trained
bert
and
a
student
hots
assessment
model
based
on
response
data
constructed
by
fine-tuning
pre-trained
llms
to
validate
the
performance
of
our
framework
we
established
a
classification
rule
based
on
bloom’s
taxonomy
for
exercise
classification
we
collected
43070
exercise
data
points
from
181
undergraduate
students
from
which
exercise
text
data
and
response
data
were
obtained
the
results
demonstrate
that
llm4ha
successfully
classifies
exercises
and
assesses
students’
hots
the
bert-based
classification
model
outperforms
chatgpt-4
and
the
llms-based
fine-tuning
model
significantly
outperforms
the
rnns-based
model
a
comprehensive
analysis
was
conducted
to
identify
the
causes
of
this
outcome
the
findings
indicate
that
the
robust

may
be
crucial
for
achieving

then
there

then
an

integrated
two
features
of

sociocultural
theory
of

concept
development
as
a
dialectical
process
of

our
findings
show
that
both
top-down

approaches
to
integrating

were
effective
but
underused
we
illustrate
this
by
mapping
pupils
shared
understanding
in
a
sociotechnical
space
visualized
as
a
process
of
“rising

and
use
of

this
chapter
addresses
the
importance
of
critical
and
creative

education
across
the

the
reading

digital

in
this

production
are
seen
as
central
dimensions
of
a
wider
and
more
relevant
conceptualization
of

stem
education
however
programming
concepts
and
syntax
are
extremely
abstract
we
developed
an
augmented

ar-based
learning
system
to
make
programming
concepts
tangible
specifically
we
adopted
a
high
interactive
ar
mode
that
allows
students
to
freely
assemble
puzzle
cards
to
compare
various
3d
animated
programming
results
this
study
adopted
a
quasi-experimental
design
and
recruited
98
fifth

as
participants
three
groups
named
the
high
interactive
ar
low
interactive
ar
and
the
traditional

control
groups
were
formed
the
results
revealed
that
the
ar-based
instruction
especially
the
high
interactive
ar
mode
helped
the
students
improve
their
programming
achievements
gain
higher

motivation
reduce
their
cognitive

and
acquire
a
high

acceptance
the

mainly
showed
that
the
students
in
the
high

group
attained
more
positive
experiences
of
assembling

our
study
suggests
that
using
ar
technology
alone
did
not
facilitate
learning
motivation
although
it
did
produce
better
programming
achievements
compared
to
the
traditional
learning
a
high
interactive
design
such
as
“puzzle

is
vital
for
arousing
higher
motivation
which
can
in
turn
facilitate
a
more
in-depth

logic
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that

are
among
the
qualities

important
pillars
in
achieving
the
goals
of

in
the

where
digital

this
makes
it
necessary
to

makes
several
recommendations
for

makers
in

as
a
reference
based
on
the
results
voice
assistants
vas
are
available
in
the
family
context
and
are
easy
to
interact
with
due
to
the
opaqueness
of
these
assistants
however
children
in
particular
might
be
unaware
of
potential
negative
consequences
eg
with
regard
to
privacy
to
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
children’s
knowledge
about
vas
of
how
to
facilitate
knowledge
regarding

focusing
here
on
parental
interventions
and
of
how
children’s
knowledge
and
understanding
affects
their
communicative
behavior
towards
vas
focusing
here
on
telling
a
secret
to
the
va
we
conducted
a
longitudinal
field
study
with
16
families
n20
children
the
emphasis
was
on
differentiating
between
how
vas
store
and
process
data
as
both
aspects
are
important
for
a
sophisticated
usage
but
vary
in
how
they
are
experienced
or
understood
the
qualitative
data
demonstrated
that
children
draw
observable
inferences
from
vas’
behavior
which
explains
why
children
know
more
about
how
data
is
processed
than
about
how
it
is
stored
or
accessed
our
results
indicate
that
parental
interventions
positively
affect
children’s
understanding
of
data
processing
but
that
this
cannot
be
transferred
to
data
storage
indicating
the
need
for
self-explaining
systems
lastly
knowledge
about
how
data
is
stored
negatively
predicts
the
willingness
to
entrust
a
secret
to
the
system
which
underlines
the
importance
of
a
basic
understanding
of
how
technologies
work
also
for
younger
users
previous

have
revealed
numerous
benefits
of
computer-mediated
learning
yet
the
design
of
such

are
not
always
supportive
for
adult-learners
studies
show
that
higher_education
adult-learners
are
wary
of
the
digital
environment
in
computer-mediated
courses
and
hence
refrain
from
online
interaction
resulting
in
lower
learning
outcomes
and
lower
perceived
learning
satisfaction
without
an
instructional
model
that
supports
adult-learners’
online
interaction
teachers
may
fall
back
on
traditional
in-class
teaching
in
an
effort
to
make
up
for
missed
learning
opportunities
to
remedy
this
design
principles
specifically
supportive
for

honey
bee
foraging
is
a
complex
behavior
because
it
involves
tens
of
thousands
of
organisms
making
decisions
about
where
to
collect
pollen
and
nectar
based
on
the
quality
of
resources
and
the
distance
to
flowers
studying
this
aspect
of
their
biology
is
possible
through
direct
observations
but
the
large
number
of
individuals
involved
in
this
behavior
makes
the
implementation
of
technologies
ideal
to
scale
up
this
type
of
study
consequently
there
is
a
need
for
instruments
that
can
facilitate
accurate
assessments
of
honey
bee
foraging
at
the
colony
level
to
address
this
need
this
work
aimed
to
develop
an
automated
imaging
system
for
monitoring
the
in-and-out
activity
of
honey
bee
foragers
as
they
walk
through
a
customized
entrance
with
a
camera
sensor
at
the
hive
entrance
we
used
apriltags
attached
to
each
bee’s
thorax
to
provide
unique
identification
numbers
that
allowed
the
system
to
track
in-and-out
events
throughout
the
foraging
season
of
the

our
design
relies
on
low-cost
raspberry
pi
computers
and
cameras
along
with
commercially
off-the-shelf
components
making
it
easily
reproducible
with
the
open-source

provided
we
successfully
deployed
and
evaluated
our

in
six
locations
demonstrating
consistent

about
the
development
of
the

data
collected
from

novice
programmers
struggle
to
comprehend
specific
programming
constructs
such
as
arrays
recursion
and
loops
one
way
to
address
this
challenge
is
to
provide
practice
problems
for
students
in
these
topics
that
are
considered
difficult
to
comprehend
—
such
as
nested
loops
it
is
proven
that
practice
aids
program
comprehension
hence
since
it
is
time
consuming
to
manually
create
many
practice
problems
synthesising
these
problems
is
an
expert
artificial
intelligence
task
that
is
worth
investigating
in
this
paper
we
present
the
synthesis
of
nested
loop
exercises
in
python
for
practice
using
a
context-free
grammar
we
defined
the
grammar
rules
for
modeling
program
templates
algorithms
were
designed
and
implemented
for
the
generation
of
structurally
different
nested
loop
exercises
based
on
the
defined
production
rules
of
the
context-free
grammar
each
program
generated
consists
of
two
or
more
looping
statements
with
a
nesting
and
the
context-free
grammar
rules
also
allow
for
the
spawning
of
infinitely
many
sub-loops
for
every
loop
we
checked
for
the
correctness
of
the
synthesised
nested
loop
programs
with
an
experimental
procedure
of
iteratively
supplying
these
programs
to
the
python
interpreter
the
first
120000
iterations
returned
no
syntactic
bugs
hence
showing
that
these
programs
do
compile
and
have
outputs
furthermore
an
evaluation
of
the
programs
was
carried
out
in
a
survey
with
210
participants
novice
and
expert
programmers
the
results
of
the
evaluation
show
that
over
82
of
the
participants
agreed
that
the
synthesised
exercises
were
correctly
generated
solvable
and
can
be
used
as

the
recent

a

the

differing
in
the
level
of

a
systematic
literature
review
was
conducted
to
identify
how
dc
has
been
operationalized
in

the
findings
reveal
that
dc
is
often
used
as
an
umbrella

tasks
that
nevertheless
fail
to
actively
engage

while
interdisciplinary
approaches
to
dc
have
been
proposed
disciplines
such

not
considered
finally
digital

are
important
issues
to

to
support
21st

in
the

era
for

a
qualitative
research
methodology
was
applied
in
this

a
semi-structured
interview
was
conducted
to
collect
data
from
five
k-3
female
teachers
who
implemented
online
education
during
the
pandemic
three
themes
emerged
from
the
findings
1
effects
of
the
pandemic
as
related
to
online
teaching
for

of
21st

skills
2
elaboration

to
facilitate
such
attainment
and
3
challenges
that
exist
for
distance
learning
and
student
acquisition
of
21st

skills
therefore
the
findings
suggest
that
elementary
teachers
should
find
opportunities
for
elementary
students
to
experience
distance
learning
as
an
ongoing
learning
solution
in
order
to
incorporate
innovative

that
enhance

fundamental
change
in

it
requires
a
new
type
of

to
deal

this
new

yet
it

crystal
clear
what
these
new

should
be
especially
those
relating
to
the
discipline
of

management
project
leaders
are
required
to
implement
and
manage
4ir-related
projects
but
do
not
necessarily
have
the
required
competencies
this
is
especially
the
case
in
a
developing
country
such
as
south
africa
the
study
explored
the
digital
competencies
that
are
deemed
important
by
project
managers
in
managing
projects
in
the
digital
economy
q-methodology
was
used
to
determine
potential
perspectives
and
three
confirming
perspectives
and
one
emergent
perspective
were
identified
the
main
competence
deemed
important
is
online
communication
and
collaboration
whereas
cybersecurity
is
deemed
unimportant
this
study
is
the
first
of
its
kind
and
provides
insight
into
the
digital
intelligence
of
project
leaders
it
contributes
to
the
current
debate
around
the
future
digital
competencies
and
skills
that
are
required
it
also
provides
guidelines
for
organisations
on
how
to
plan

we
generated
six

we
also
identified
areas
where
ar

can
benefit
makerspaces
such
as
teaching

facilitating

activities
enhancing
contextualization
of

we
observed
that
students
participating
in
co-design
demonstrated
improved
understanding
of

design
enthusiasm
for
engaging
with
makerspaces
and
ar
and
increased
critical_thinking

in
gamification
personalization
is
considered
an
important
field
of
research
since
it
can
improve
user
engagement
and
motivation
particularly
effective
gamified
learning
needs
to
strike
a
balance
between
gameful
design
that
promotes
engagement
and
does
not
negatively
affect
content
comprehension
and
absorption
the
existing
traditional
user-type
questionnaires
approaches
are
time-consuming
and
intrusive
hampering
the
user’s
focus
previous
research
in
gamification
demonstrated
how
to
automate
player
profile
creation
through
log
file
analysis
of
gameful
systems
instead
of
traditional
approaches
however
psychological
archetypes
and
motivational
groups
can
simplify
the
process
of
collecting
data
to
achieve
a
balanced
level
of
personalization
for
gamified
systems
which
are
grounded
on
the
user’s
profile
and
preferences
which
can
help
with
their
immersion
to
attend
to
the
needs
of
a
wide
range
of
fields
that
introduce
gamification
to
systems
that
are
not
classified
as
games
a
new
ludic
approach
was
created
to
define
user
types
based
on
user
interaction
using
symbolic
images
in
this
exploratory
research
we
tested
this
approach
in
two
card-sorting
studies
n35
and
n19
our
results
show
that
the
images
can
be
used
to
predict
the
users’
archetypes
and
motivational
groups
accurately
thus
we
contribute
with
validating
an
image-based
user
type
classification
method
that
is
easier
to
deploy
in
systems
that
do
not
aim
to
behave
as
a
game
but
are
looking
to
reap
the
benefits
of
personalizing
a
user’s
content
and
gameful
experience
where
relevant
our
second
contribution
is
delivering
guidelines
to
replicate
this
validation
method
to
other
existing
approaches
we
expect
that
with
this
guideline
we
facilitate
personalization
with
other
user
typologies
without
disrupting
the
gameful
experience

in
order
to
improve
the

china
proposed
the
“new

2017
this

and
discovered
the
common
key
issues
such
as
mechanism
issues
ability
issues
and
discipline
issues
that
are
concerned
in
existing

the
research
findings
are
as
follows
1
the
commonness
of
construction
schemes
is
emerging
in
terms
of
mechanism
construction
the
mechanism
of
collaborative
education
receives
the
most
attention
while
the
talent
ability
pays
more
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
soft

2
the
overall
design
of
the
projects
are
somewhat
lacking
innovation
and
features
and
certain
construction

are
similar
failing
to
effectively
combine
the
advantages
of

local
industries
and
truly
show
its

3
most
of
the
construction

are
aimed
at
the
transformation
of
traditional

and
there
is
little
construction
of

revealed
that
there
was

there
exists
literary
evidence
that
there
is
an
established
relationship
between
humanizing

this
study
seeks
to
evaluate
factors
that
impact
the
perception
surrounding
the
fairness
of
social

and
the
impact
of
these
factors
on

a
qualitative
approach
was
used
to
examine
the

factors
related
to
social

and
their
impact
on

with
the
help
of
data
collected
from
32
professionals
with
diverse

obtained
from
manual

and
nvivo
were
assessed
to
evaluate
the
convergence
of

for
the
confluence
of

and
establish
thematic

the
findings
revealed
two
major
themes
namely
artificial

were
broken
then

was
driven
by

allows
for
a

granular
view
showing
that
the
positive

were
concentrated
in

are
utilized
that
contain
a
multitude
of
critical

although
these
offer
major
advantages
they
are
also
exposed
to
new
external
and
frequently
uncontrollable
factors
increasing
their
risk
exposure
and
enhancing
their
vulnerability
therefore
increasing

has
become
a
prerequisite
for
its
survival
but
continuous
resilience
improvement
led
by

will
help
them
to
prosper
according
to
researchers
officers
should
be
able
to
catalogue

prioritize
threats
and

but
is
this
only
the
case
discrete

however
how
these

have
not
been
thoroughly
understood
to

is
to
inquire

concerning
the
necessary

officers
by
exploring
current

as
these
are
acknowledged
in
experts’
opinions
and

so
a

was
developed
and
distributed
to
experts
in

to
indicate
responsibilities
and
prioritize

that
resilient

should
possess
the
findings
highlighted
significant
responsibilities
related
to
managing
smart
city
risks
and
identified
a
distinct

unique
to
officers
in
this
area
emphasizing
the
need
for
targeted
efforts
to
enhance
urban
resilience
through
the
initiatives
led
by

this
article
establishes
a
clear
path
for
advancing
smart
city
research
by
highlighting
competencies
that
could
be
integrated
into
educational
curriculums
these
competencies
are
essential
for
training
a
workforce
that
not
only
enhances
disaster

awareness
but
also
equips
cities
to
handle
potential

consists
mostly
of

there
have
been
no

will
likely
further

participation
in

will
also
likely
further

but
the
adoption
of
these

autism
spectrum
disorder
asd
is
a
neurodevelopmental
disability
that
exhibits
sluggish
progress
in
vocal
development
restricted
interest
in
normal
activity
and
repetitive
disoriented
behavior
this
syndrome
has
gained
a
lot
of
attention
due
to
its
prevalence
among
children
across
all
countries
and
from
different
economic
backgrounds
however
asd
detection
and
treatment
yet
remains
in
its
infancy
due
to
the
lack
of
awareness
among
parents
limited
screening
of
proper
developmental
milestones
and
a
dearth
of
diagnostic
tools
to
classify
this
syndrome
with
convincing
accuracy
recent
studies
report
that
scalable
biomarkers
for
early
detection
have
made
little
progress
in
research
due
to
the
erraticism
of
this
disorder
moreover
the
study
on
developing
tools
or
applications
for
parents
teachers
and
healthcare
workers
to
identify
children
who
exhibit
any
form
of
autism
is
still
a
work
in

interesting
details
that

nature
of

and
the

the

even
if
many
researchers
and

have
advocated
for

education
since
early

it
is
usually
kept
for
undergraduate

graduate-level

what
prevents
systems
theory
and
control
education
from
being
integrated
into
k12
education
is
the
lack
of
available
educational
resources
and
the
lack
of
indicators
to
represent
the

organizations
face
the
challenge
of

often
fall
short
failing
to

also
that

this
phenomenon
has
been
exacerbated
since
the
release
of
chatgpt
in
2022
which
has
permanently
transformed
various
educational
activities
and
sparked
widespread
scientific
interest
research
suggests
that
chatgpt
can
help
students
navigate
the
complexities
of
stem

however
only
a
few
studies
have
directed
attention
to
the
use
of
chatgpt
in
stem
subjects
in
upper
secondary_education
with
the
purpose
of
addressing
this

the
aim
of
this

is
to
explore
how
students
experience
chatgpt
for
their
stem
studies
encompassing
their
usage
perceptions
and
general
knowledge
about
this
technology
using
a
mixed_methods
approach
the
data
collected
included
a
survey

the
results
show
widespread
adoption
of
chatgpt
across
stem

among
participants
particularly
in
biology
and
especially
as
a
tool
to
support
the
understanding

they
demonstrated
some
effective

to
define
and
exemplify
the

design
pad
as
it
is
used
in
the
domain
of
educational
testing
the
crucial
aspect
of
pad
approaches
is
that
they
are
centered
on
models
of
the
cognitive
psychology
involved
in
students
responding
to
the
assessment
and
articulate
how
to
use
that
as
the
basis
for
development
of
the
assessments
the
account
gives
an
extended
description
of
one
pad
approach
and
summarizes
four
others
noting
common
characteristics
among
them
it
concludes
with
a
discussion
of
how
pad
approaches
can
be
extended
into
the
domain
of

and
a
consideration
of
why

has
already
been
demonstrated
in
several
application
domains
their
abilities
in
generating
complex

need
to
be
explored
as
an
intriguing
case
is
the
goodness
of
the
machine
and
deep

models
generated
by
these
llms
in
conducting
automated
scientific

where
a

and
thus
may
opt
to
leverage

we
notice
that
using
llms
we
are
able
to
generate
deep
learning-based
models
with
executable

for
each
dataset
separately
whose
performance
are
comparable
with
the
manually
crafted
and
optimized
lstm
models
for
predicting
the
whole

we
also
noticed
that
chatgpt
outperforms
the
other
llms
in
generating
more
accurate

furthermore
we
observed
that
the
goodness
of
the
generated
models
vary
with
respect
to
the
“temperature”
parameter
used
in
configuring
llms
the
results
can
be
beneficial
for

analysts
and
practitioners
who
would
like
to
leverage
generative

three
iterations
of
the
course
in
a
collaborative
manner
with

instructor
and
this
data
set
is
expanding
continuously
with
every
new
generation
of
students
qlearn
is
a
smart

environment
offering
the
students
valuable
feedback
and
a
good
preparation
for
the
exam
some
metrics
that
quantify
the
coverage
rate
of
the
course
syllabus
attained
by
students
or
their
understanding
level
of
knowledge
are
provided
by
qlearn
the
artificial
intelligent
component
of
qlearn
application
uses
these
measures
to
make
predictions
for
students’
outcomes
at
the
exam
to
find
out
which
topics
need
to
be
practised
more
and
to
recommend
learning
plans
according
to
students’
individual
needs
the
contribution
of
the
paper
is
therefore
twofold
firstly
we
propose
a
new
learning
design
based
on
students’
involvement
in
a
collaborative
manner
the
second
contribution
of
the
paper
is
qlearn
a
software
application
that
provides
support
implementation
for
the
proposed
learning
process
design
not
only
does
qlearn
platform
provide
a
smart
learning
environment
for
students
but
it
also
ensures
the
knowledge
transfer
from
instructors
to
students
in
an
efficient
and
effective
way
this
study
took
place
at
the
beginning
of
the
covid-19

worldwide
were
making
the
transition
to
online

need
to
consider
three
elements
the

however
many
countries
have
failed
to
incorporate
the

of
these

and
obstacles
in

so
we
analyzed
the
responses
to
an
online
survey
from
1391
active

across
20
countries
in
the

this
revealed
varying
understandings
of
21st
century
skills
with
little
common
understanding
most
teachers
failed
to
mention
the
skills
included
in
the
most
popular
framework
the
4
cs
those
who
did
reported
using
the
same
strategies
regardless
of
the
skill
being
taught
these
strategies
included
project-based_learning
oracy
activities
literacy
strategies
and
teamwork
we
conclude
that
there
is
little
or
no
common
understanding
around
these

nor
the
best

for
developing
them
our

often
inspires
students’
passion
for

cs
however
the
evidence
in
the

suggests
that
the

are
anything

the

seems
to
substantiate
cs1
failure
attrition
rates
and
lack
of
diversity
in
most
cs
classes
meanwhile
for
its
simplicity
in
introducing
programming
to
beginners
primary
and
secondary
schools
use
scratch
an
educational
programming
environment
developed
by
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
usa
for
the
same
reason
higher
institutions
now
include
some
forms
of
scratch
instruction
in
cs1
the
question
remains
to
what
extent
is
scratch
engaging
especially
for
students
in
higher_education
this
study
addressed
this
gap
by
observing
college
computer
science
students
exposed
to
a
constructionist
scratch
programming
pedagogy
we
adopted
a
descriptive
design
based
on
quantitative
observations
to
observe
the
class
during
a
weekly
2-hour
session
we
employed
five
cs
educators
one
observer
per
week
each
observer
employing
a
20-item
observation
protocol
rated
the
extent
of
affective
behavioral
and
cognitive
engagement
of
first-year
cs
students
in
a
polytechnic
in
north
central
nigeria
most
of
the
students
were
learning
to
program
for
the
first
time
analysis
of
the
data
showed
a
significant
agreement
in
the
ratings
of
the
five
observers
for
overall
student
engagement
although
the
impact
was
moderate
however
while
agreement
in
their
ratings
for
affective
engagement
was
significant
with
a
large
effect
there
was
no
significant
concordance
in
their
ratings
for
behavioral
engagement
observers
also
significantly
agreed
in
their
ratings
for
cognitive
engagement
however
the
impact
was
moderate
these
findings
suggest
that
employing
scratch
in
higher_education
can
be
engaging
and
useful
especially
for
students
with
no
prior
programming
experience
despite
the

encountered
by
89

in
the
state
of
idaho
participants
were
predominantly
white
female

serving
in

a
mixed-methods
analysis
of
survey
responses
revealed
that
teachers
were
generally
underprepared
for
integrating
genai
with
fewer
than
half
incorporating
it
into
their
educational
practices
unlike
the
widespread
classroom
integration
patterns
observed
with
general
educational
technologies
teachers
in
this
study
tended
to
use
genai
for
out-of-classroom
duties
ie
lesson
preparation
assessment
and
administrative
tasks
rather
than
for
real-time
teaching
and
learning
these
preferences
could
be
attributed
to
key
barriers
teachers
faced
including
doubts
about
genais
ability
to
manage
risks
ie
technology
value
beliefs
reduced
human

in

and
the

reviews
the
technology-enabled

place
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
and
investigated
their
effectiveness
on

drawing
on

we
systematically
analyzed
the

dimensions
of
37
technology-enabled
tpd

implemented
during
the

the
findings
demonstrate
that
technology-enabled
tpd

could
develop
teachers’
knowledge
and
skills
critical
to
quality
teaching
during
the
pandemic
and
create
environments
that
foster

however
there
needs
to
be

furthermore
equity

to
this
end
an
increasing

are
pursuing
the

our

aims
at
understanding
how
speculative

resources
can
meet
and
respond
to
the
goals
of
supporting
childrens
critical
reflection
on

technologies
and
their
impact
on
society
through
revisiting
relevant
literature
on
these
topics
and
critically
analyzing
our
own
practices
in
three
different
settings
we
identify
a
set
of
opportunities
and
challenges
oriented
at
guiding
the
design
of
resources
capable
of
taking
advantage
of
speculative
fiction
as
a
way
to
support
critical
reflection
rural
schools
tend
not
to
have
enough
laboratory
and
experimentation
equipment
which
can
be
an
obstacle
that
hinders
student
learning
in
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem
areas
moreover
this
loss
of
competencies
can
reduce
their
employment
opportunities
while
society
itself
is
deprived
of
that
human
capital
remote
laboratories
have
emerged
as
a
way
of
countering
the
effects
of
insufficient
investment
in
equipment
or
the
inability
to
acquire
the
latter
by
way
of
example
the
goal
of
project
r3
which
is
presented
in
this
article
is
to
reduce
the
absence
or
shortage
of
laboratories
in
the
rural
world
via
the
use
of
remote

specifically
this
article
presents
the
experience
the
results
and
the
main
conclusions
of
project
r3
during
its
first
year
of
life
it
is
worth
noting
that
project
r3
has
been
deployed
not
only
in
rural
but
also
in
urban
environments
making
it
possible
to
compare
learning
results
and
satisfaction
levels
for
students
in
both
spheres
and
identify
those
experiments
that
provide
the
best
learning
experience
and
are
most
popular
among
pupils
and
teachers
the
main
objective
is
that
from
the
local
analysis
the
project
has
only
been
conducted
in
spain
it
might
be
possible
to
draw
conclusions
of
a
global
nature
that
might
be
extrapolated
to
other
countries
in
the
european
union
with
similar
socio-demographics
initial
results
are
in
the
direction
of
certifying
that
student
achievement
and
satisfaction
are
higher
in
rural
than
in
urban
environments
the
paper
considers
the
possibility
of
constructing
a
specialized
computing
system
oriented
at
the
transmission
of
data
through
information
channels
that
are
determined
taking
into
account
the
semantics
of
the
selected
data
in
the
process
of
computations
the
data
is
connected
with
semantic
characteristics
that
describe
the
channel
of
computations
which
can
be
considered
as
a
method
of
semantic
data
enrichment
the
system
of
information
channels
as
a
whole
can
be
considered
as
an
information
graph
describing
the
structuring
of
the
processed
data
the
information
graph
supports
the
data
model
in
the
form
of
a
network
the
framework
of
which
are
objects
and
the
relationships
between
them
the
paper
proposes
language
tools
for
determining
the
information
graph
and
interpretation
tools
that
provide
practical
computations
the
set
of
information
channels
that
make
up
the
information
graph
can
be
considered
as
a
low-level
tool
for
data
enrichment
the
paper
studies
the
possibility
of
determining
tools
of
higher
level
an
applicative
type
language
is
proposed
for
defining
information
graphs
the
syntax
and
semantics
of
the
language
are
specified
the
proposed
language
can
be
considered
as
an
intermediate
level
tool
for
defining
semantics
a
procedure
is
proposed
for
compiling
the
language
into
a
low-level
construct
preserving
the
semantics
of
the
language
the
supporting
system
for
the
proposed
computing
system
includes
a
low-level

interpreter
as
well
as
an
intermediate-level

compiler
into
a

the
supporting
system
is
implemented
in
an

dt
has
drawn
increasing
attention
in
k-12
education
however
research
on

has
not
yet
been
comprehensively
reviewed
the
current
review
research
attempted
to
bridge
this
gap
in
the
field
following
the
prisma
guidelines
this
review
examined
40
empirical
studies
on
dt
in
k-12
education
with
specific
emphasis
on
four
key
aspects
1

areas
2
incorporation

3
methodologies
and
4
reported
findings
in
reviewed
studies
in
terms
of
the
first
aspect
the
main
themes
to
analyze
were
identified
as
participant
perspective
instructional
intervention
learning
assessment
and
design
mechanism
in
terms
of
the
second
aspect
it
was
found
that
studies
were
conducted
primarily
in
the
context
of
design
technology
engineering
and
stem
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
education
in
middle
schools
and
durations
ranging
from
three
days
to
nine
weeks
in
terms
of
the
third
aspect
these
studies
typically
carried
out
qualitative
analysis
of
documents
and
administered
questionnaires
interviews
and
observations
the
articles
described
the
development
of
questionnaires
online
games
and
scales
to
evaluate
dt
in
terms
of
the
fourth
aspect
the
findings
showed
that
dt
was
welcomed
by
most
participants
and
it
was
capable
of
optimizing
learning
processes
and
helped
promote
student
learning
dt
can
be
developed
not
only
through
dt
courses
but
also
through
programming
learning
the
effective
way
to
dt
was
explained
through
time
allocation
modalities
and
iteration
sequence
exploration
based
on
the
findings
it
may
be
concluded
that
dt
is
still
in
an
early
development
stage
in
k-12
education
and
so
research
on
dt
has
not
yet
been
broadly
established
with
academic

more
studies
on

supported
by
various
dt
elements

we
examine
the

by
branch
of

and
its
relationship
with
the

it
is
completed
with
a

paired
with
a
quasi-experimental
method
to
determine
if
the
alternative
hypothesis
of
gender
inequality
in
the
means
of

as
an
assessment
of
academic
performance
could
be
accepted
between
two
orientations
of

the
results
showed
in
the
experimental

in
learning
higher
scores
compared
to
the
control
group
not
finding
statistically
significant
gender
differences
in
academic

as
a
conclusion
we
propose
the
transformation
of
teaching-learning
methodologies
for
greater
student
involvement

that
contributes
to
the

were
created
based
on
the

the
results
indicated
that
p-pjbl
can
effectively
improve

and
reduce
the

gap
notably
p-pjbl
had
a
more
positive
effect
on

moreover
students
with
higher-level

demonstrated
greater
improvement
in

these
findings
provide
valuable
insight
into
the
potential

of
p-pjbl
for
improving

and
examines
how
the

approach
we
analyzed
the
dynamics
of
creative
engagement
in
mathematics
lessons
considering
whether
this
engagement
occurred
at
the
individual

the
findings
revealed
that

notice
the

ai
was
not
a

the
greater
the

has
on

the
more
pressing
the
need
is
for
us
to

it
this

that
can
be
leveraged
to

ai
has
the
potential
to
educate
train
and
improve
the
performance
of
humans
making
them
better
at
their

can
enhance
human

in
numerous
respects
such
as
through
improving
the
productivity
of

health
water
education
and
energy
services
however
the
misuse
of

due
to
algorithm
bias
and
a
lack
of
governance
could
inhibit
human
rights
and
result
in
employment
gender
and
racial
inequality
we
envision
that
ai
can
evolve
into
human-centered
ai
hai
which
refers
to
approaching
ai
from
a
human
perspective
by
considering
human
conditions
and
contexts
most
current
discussions
on
ai
technology
focus
on
how
ai
can
enable
human
performance
however
we
explore
ai
can
also
inhibit
the
human
condition
and
advocate
for
an
in-depth
dialog
between
technology-
and
humanity-based
researchers
to
improve
understanding
of
hai
from
various
perspectives
the
disruption
in
management
education
caused
by
covid-19
was
significant
creating
a
noteworthy
impetus
for
new
research
given
that
covid-19
has
transitioned
from
pandemic
to
endemic
it
is
an
opportune
time
to
retrospect
the
contributions
of
related
research
to
shape
the
future
of
management
education
using
the
spar-4-slr
protocol
a
systematic
literature
review
was
conducted
on
management
education
research
relating
to
covid-19
published
between
2020
and
2022
a
total
of
56
relevant
articles
were
found
in
and
retrieved
from
the
web
of
science
database
and
subsequently
analyzed
using
descriptive
and
content
analyses
the
descriptive
analysis
revealed
a
steep
increase
in
research
on
the
impact
of
covid-19
on
management
education
over
time
with
most
research
appearing
in
the
international
journal
of
management
education
the
contributions
came
from
various
countries
with
the
top
five
being
the
usa
the
uk
australia
india
and
china
the
content
analysis
showed
that
most
research
adopted
empirical
methodologies
while
self-determination
theory
emerged
as
the
most
popular
theoretical
lens
for
study
the
related
research
revolved
around
five
major
themes—ie
digital
teaching
and
learning
collaboration
and
partnership
embracing
uncertainty
and
building
resilience
transformation
and
innovation
and
developing
an
entrepreneurial
mindset—and
provided
implications
for
management
education
in
the
new
normal
wherein
the
priority
is
focused
on
enhancing
education
quality
and
preparing
future

data
science
education
is
a
rapidly
growing
field
motivating
the

across
all
educational
levels
within
this
landscape
new
block-based
programming
bbp
environments
have
been
developed
to
integrate
data
visualization
functionalities
however
the
construction
of
visualizations
entails
distinct
goals
and
forms
of
interaction
from
those
typically
used
in
conventional
programming
which
should
be
considered
in
designing
those
environments
drawing
inspiration
from
taxonomies
within
the
field
of
information
visualization
we
derived
a
framework
for
the
analysis
of
educational
tools
in
this
domain
comprising
four
categories
supported
goals
expressiveness
abstraction
and
transparency
we
situate
six
existing
bbp
environments
within
the
design
space
of
the
framework
and
illustrate
its
application
by
describing
the
design
of

a
bbp
environment
developed
to
address

our
goal
is
to
contribute
to
a
more
theoretically
grounded
discussion
on
the
topic
by
connecting
well-established
research
on
professional
tools
for
data

and
the
design
of
related
educational

targeted
at
middle
and
high_school
students
the
significance
of
adapting
to
a
rapidly
changing
world
is
quite
evident
in
the
current
day
thus
the
awareness
of
how
to
teach
students
so
that
they
can
be
ready
to
face
challenges
in
the

is
very
important
early
education

and
educational
methods
in
this

is
investigated
by
considering
two
variables
namely
the

modalities
caused
by
the
covid-19

there
were
significant

has
evolved
to
embrace
advanced
digital

has
emerged
as
a

offering
a
revolutionary

this
systematic
review
explores
how
the

aligns
with
the
sdgs
it
focuses
on
identifying
potential
co-benefits
and
trade-offs
between
the
metaverse
and
sdgs
the
results
indicate
that
research
primarily
focuses
on
sdgs
related
to
health
education
innovation
sustainable

and
responsible
consumption
and
production
in
contrast
less
attention
is
given
to

to
enhance
smart

operational
efficiency
transparency
and
evidence-based
decision-making
through
big
data
analytics
and
virtual

however
it
also
identifies
risks
such
as
exacerbating
disparities
and
increasing
environmental
burdens
while
the
metaverse
can
offer
transformative
solutions
for
smart
urban
environments
its
benefits
must
be
balanced
with
equitable
access
and
environmental
sustainability
to
effectively
contribute
to
the
sdgs
this
requires
addressing
the
digital

technological
divide
and
environmental
concerns
to
foster
inclusive
urban

that
uphold
peace
justice
and

underscores
the
need
for

social
robots
will
be
extensively
used
in
the
teaching
field
consequently
it
is
important
to
determine
how
these
robots
can
optimally
interact
with
students
this
paper
specifically
looks
at
the
performance
of
social
robots
in
place
of
university
professors
in
the
field
of
engineering
measuring
three
outcomes
enjoyment
questionnaire
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
academic
test
after
class
and
final
exam
grades
and
level
of
surprise
facial
expressions
monitored
by
cameras
inspired
by
previous
cognitive
studies
which
have
evidenced
that
feelings
of
surprise
and
familiarity
affect
the
learning
process
the
hypothesis
of
this
research
is
that
robot-tutors
will
increase
students
enjoyment
leading
the
research
to
question
whether
higher
levels
of
enjoyment
strongly
correlate
with
a
higher
acquisition
of
knowledge
through
a
series
of
three
experiments
using
the
same
subject
material
three
variables
were
tested
1
one
robot-tutor
lecture
2
one
human-tutor
lecture
3
two
robot-tutor
lectures
initial
findings
showed
that
students
lectured
by
a
human-tutor
once
acquired
a
higher
level
of
knowledge
compared
to
those
lectured
by
a
robot-tutor
once
however
those
in
the
robot-tutor
lecture
shared
higher
levels
of
enjoyment
as
well
as
increased
expressions
of
surprise
when
students
were
lectured
by
a
robot-tutor
for
the
second
time
results
showed
both
a
higher
level
of
acquired
knowledge
and
enjoyment
and
a
drop
in
expressed
surprise
compared
to
both
one
human-tutor
lecture
and
one
robot-tutor
lecture
or
one
robot-tutor
lecture
we
conclude
that
high
levels
of
surprise
distracted
students
initially
but
once
overcome
acted
as
motivation
to
study
the
use
of

has
emerged
as
a

nevertheless
the
successful
implementation
of
artificial

in
educational
contexts
hinges
upon
various
factors
one
of
which
is
the
perspective
of
instructors
with
this
in
mind
this
study
aimed
to
examine
the
perspectives
of
536
instructors
in
stem
and
non-stem
disciplines
regarding
ai
integration
the
respondents’
thoughts
opinions
and
concerns
regarding
advantages

were
gathered
through
an
online
questionnaire
featuring
both
closed
and
open-ended
questions
additionally
a
series
of
semi-structured
interview
sessions
were
conducted
with
a
cohort
of
instructors
to
collect
qualitative
and
quantitative
data
the
findings
revealed
that
both
stem
and
non-stem
instructors
expressed
positive
attitudes
toward
the
integration
of
ai
technologies
into
education
however
notable
differences
in
responses
and
concerns
were
also
identified
in
relation
to
the
perceived
capabilities
and
limitations
of
ai
technologies
within
educational
contexts
the
results
further
elucidated
a
spectrum
of
opinions
on
the
benefits
eg
scalability
and
tirelessness
drawbacks
eg
deepfake
technology
and
comfort-seeking
behavior
and
potential
challenges
eg
educational
disillusionment
and
espionage
associated
with
ai
integration
the
study
concluded
by
discussing
the
implications
of
these
findings
for
stem
and
non-stem
education
and
offering
recommendations
for
the
effective
and
ethical
integration
of
ai

that
one
of
the
impressive

one
of
the
deadliest

today
automatic

diabetes
or
not
unfortunately
dl
is
a
high-complexity

proposes
a

framework
to
tackle
those
issues
in
classifying
two
diabetes
datasets
binary-class
pima

kmc
is
first
carried
out
to
remove

and
keep
the
competent

set
the
dimension
of
the

is
then
reduced
using
an
autoencoder
ae
to
minimize
the
distances
of
the
intra-class

maximize
that
of
the
inter-class
a

knn
classifier
and
two

are
used
to
detect

mvmcnn
is
introduced
an
investigation
based
on
5-fold

fcv
informs
that
for

the
proposed
combination
of
kmc
ae
and
mvmcnn
achieves
the
highest
accuracy
of
9913
which
is
slightly
higher
than
the
state-of-the-art
dl-based

an
evaluation
based
on
10-fcv
also
indicates
that
for
the
multiclass
diabetes
type
it
obtains
a
higher
accuracy
of
9524
than
the
dl-based
model
for

the
paper
explores
the
genesis

and
what
it
portends
for
a

it
reflects
on
the
value
that
is
promised
for

from
the
realistic

challenges
are
critically
examined
to
consider
how
the
4ir
could
impact
on
tertiary

it
then
proceeds
to
examine
the

individual
levels
and
the
challenges
and
obstacles
to
be
overcome
at
these

to
be
realized
the
paper
explores
what
the
phenomenon
of
the
4ir
is
drawing
on
the
arguments
of
key
proponents
including
skeptics
it
explores
what
kinds
of
changes
are
envisaged
as
the
phenomenon
progresses
it
then
proceeds
to
examine
how
institutions
may
be
positioned
to
harness
the
4ir
for
the
benefit
of
human
wellbeing
and
in
support
of
national
and
international
social
and
economic
benefits
the
promise
of
the
4ir
to
resolve
our
developmental
challenges
has
been
sharply
questioned—perhaps
being
overhyped
given
existing
and
enduring
disadvantage
and
marginalization
that
was
not
ameliorated
in
previous
industrial

these
are
elaborated
upon
at

a

by
50
participants
from

showed
that
around

found
the

“good”
or
“very

however
more
than
5
of
the

found
weaknesses
regarding
most
of
the

this

us
to
evolve
the

this
is
achieved
by

we
found

the
case
studies
presented
in
this
work
emphasize
the
importance
of
integrating
non-technical

moreover
our
study
highlights
the
strengths
and

in
both

providing
valuable

that
can
help

there
is
growing
interest
in
teaching
computer
science
and
programming
skills
in
schools
here
we
investigated
the
efficacy
of
peer
tutoring
which
is
known
to
be
a
useful
educational
resource
in
other
domains
but
never
before
has
been
examined
in
such
a
core
aspect
of
applied
logical_thinking
in
children
we
compared
a
how
children
n
42
age
range
7
years
1
month
to
8
years
4
months
learn
computer
programming
from
an
adult
versus
learning
from
a
peer
and
b
the
effect
of
teaching
a
peer
versus
simply
revising
what
has
been
learned
our
results
indicate
that
children
taught
by
a
peer
showed
comparable
overall
performance—a
combination
of
accuracy
and
response
times—to
their
classmates
taught
by
an
adult
however
there
was
a
speed–accuracy
trade-off
and
peer-taught
children
showed
more
exploratory
behavior
with
shorter
response
times
at
the
expense
of
lower
accuracy
in
contrast
no
tutor
effects
ie
resulting
from
teaching
a
peer
were
found
thus
our
results
provide
empirical
evidence
in
support
of
peer
tutoring
as
a
way
to
help
teach
computer
programming
to
children
this
could
contribute
to
the
promotion
of
a
widespread
understanding
of
how
computers
operate
and
how
to
shape
them
which
is
essential
to
our
values
of
democracy
plurality
and
freedom
there
is
little
empirical
evidence
on
cross-domain
relations
with
science
and
other
academic
domains
which
contributes
to
a
limited
understanding
of
the
development
of

by
addressing
potentially
spurious

were
constrained
by
their

the
findings
reveal
that

were
mostly
adopted
by
high-performing

and
help-seeking
were
mostly
employed
by
low-performing

not
only
demonstrates
the
design
of
combining
eye-tracking
and
retrospective

data
to
explore
students’
use
of

but
also
provides
evidence
to
support
the
notion
that

many
studies
investigating
inquiry
learning
in
science
domains
have
appeared
over
the
years
throughout
this
period
inquiry
learning
has
been
regularly
criticized
by
scholars
who
favor
direct
instruction
over
inquiry
learning
in
this
vein
zhang
kirschner
cobern
and
sweller
2022
recently
asserted
that
direct
instruction
is
overall
superior
to
inquiry-based
instruction
and
reproached
policy
makers
for
ignoring
this
fact
in
the
current
article
we
reply
to
this
assertion
and
the
premises
on
which
it
is
based
we
review
the
evidence
and
argue
that
a
more
complete
and
correct
interpretation
of
the
literature
demonstrates
that
inquiry-based
instruction
produces
better
overall
results
for
acquiring
conceptual
knowledge
than
does
direct
instruction
we
show
that
this
conclusion
holds
for
controlled
correlational
and
program-based
studies
we
subsequently
argue
that
inquiry-based
and
direct
instruction
each
have
their
specific
virtues
and
disadvantages
and
that
the
effectiveness
of
each
approach
depends
on
moderating
factors
such
as
the
learning
goal
the
domain
involved
and
students
prior
knowledge
and
other
student
characteristics
furthermore
inquiry-based
instruction
is
most
effective
when
supplemented
with
guidance
that
can
be
personalized
based
on
these
moderating
factors
and
can
even
involve
providing
direct
instruction
therefore
we
posit
that
a
combination
of
inquiry
and
direct
instruction
may
often
be
the
best
approach
to
support
student
learning
we
conclude
that
policy
makers
rightfully
advocate
inquiry-based
instruction
particularly
when
students’
investigations
are
supplemented
with
direct
instruction
at
appropriate
junctures
large
language
models
llms
have
come
closest
among
all
models
to
date
to
mastering
human
language
yet
opinions
about
their
linguistic
and
cognitive
capabilities
remain
split
here
we
evaluate
llms
using
a
distinction
between
formal
linguistic
competence
knowledge
of
linguistic
rules
and
patterns
and
functional
linguistic
competence
understanding
and
using
language
in
the
world
we
ground
this
distinction
in
human
neuroscience
which
has
shown
that
formal
and
functional
competence
rely
on
different
neural
mechanisms
although
llms
are
surprisingly
good
at
formal
competence
their
performance
on
functional
competence
tasks
remains
spotty
and
often
requires
specialized
fine-tuning
andor
coupling
with
external
modules
we
posit
that
models
that
use
language
in
human-like
ways
would
need
to
master
both
of
these
competence
types
which
in
turn
could
require
the
emergence
of
separate
mechanisms
specialized
for
formal
versus
functional
linguistic
competence

digital

occur
when
there
are
inequities
in

to
the

afforded
by

originally
conceptualised
as

recognised
that
the

the

they
subsequently
develop
may
also
contribute
to

the
aims
of
the
current

were
twofold
firstly
to
investigate
categories
of
screen
media
use
outside

for
children
at

eight
and
whether
children
of
this
age
fall
into

whereby
different

of

use
have
already
started
to

secondly
to
consider
the
implications
of
different
modes
of

at

years
of
age
for
the
establishment
of

using
a

of
5010
children
participating
in
the

the
results
of
factor

indicated
six
categories
of

social
creative

while
four
different
modes
of

were
identified

creative

emergent

engaged
with
most
activities
on
a
fairly
regularly
basis
emergent
users
and
in
particular
limited
users
engaged
with
a
narrower
range
of
activities
and
at
lower
frequencies
we
argue
that
entertainment

and
creative

who
engage
with
a
broader
range
of
activities
and
engage
in
creative
activities
such
as

may
be
at

the
findings
can
inform
the
development
and
implementation
of
professional
learning
programs
and
policymaking
the
motivation
to
stimulate
children’s
learning
engagement
could
be
found
in
the
fact
that
learning
is
not
always
motivational
in
itself
this
is
particularly
true
when
learning
is
obligatory
and
based
upon
material
that
has
not
been
chosen
by
the
children
themselves
a
lean
ux
approach
to
the
co-design
of
an
educational
serious
videogame
mobi
is
proposed
in
this
paper
the
core
idea
is
that
childrens
natural
interest
in
playing
can
be
stimulated
by
engendering
the
feeling
that
they
are
participating
in
the
creation
of
something
the
hypothesis
is
that
this
approach
can
increase
the
childrens
level
of
engagement
and
can
facilitate
their
awareness
of
their
learning
perception
with
the
aim
of
testing
this
hypothesis
this
paper
describes
an
experience
with
50
children
with
ages
between
10
and
12
years
old
the
results
indicate
that
the
children’s
satisfaction
grew
significantly
during
the
process
with
an
important
reduction
in
the
requests
for
changes
and
that
60
had
the
perception
of
having
learned
it
can
be
concluded
that
the
co-design
based
upon
a
lean
ux
methodology
of
a
children’s
educational
serious
videogame
increases
their
level
of
product
engagement
and
facilitates
their

however
there
is
limited

investigating
whether
and
how

leads
to

analyzes
the

analysis
and
cluster

it
classifies
the
students
into
four
distinct
types
competent
cognitive-oriented
reflective-oriented
and
minimally
self-regulated

competent
self-regulated
learners
perceived
themselves
as
the
most
self-regulated
learners
and
had
the
greatest
learning
gains
although
they
did
not
perform
best
in
the
task
cognitive-oriented
self-regulated
learners
perceived
themselves
as
the
least
self-regulated
learners
although
they
were
the
second
best
in
both
the
performance
of
the
task
and
learning
gains
in
contrast
reflective
learners
had
the
best
performance
in
the
task
minimally
self-regulated
learners
did
not
perform
well
in
the
task
and
had
the
lowest
learning
gains
the
results
revealed
that
the
competent
self-regulated
learners
had
an
appropriate
assessment
of
themselves
to
obtain
knowledge
cognitive-oriented
self-regulated
learners
underestimated
themselves
reflective
learners
focused
on
the
results
of
the
task
and
minimally
self-regulated
learners
overestimated
themselves
and
exerted
the

researchers
have
explored
the
benefits
and
applications
of
virtual
reality
vr
in
different
scenarios
vr
possesses
much
potential
and
its
application
in
education
has
seen
much
research
interest
lately
however
little
systematic
work
currently
exists
on
how
researchers
have
applied
immersive
vr
for
higher_education
purposes
that
considers
the
usage
of
both
high-end
and
budget
head-mounted
displays
hmds
hence
we
propose
using
systematic
mapping
to
identify
design
elements
of
existing
research
dedicated
to
the
application
of
vr
in
higher_education
the
reviewed
articles
were
acquired
by
extracting
key
information
from
documents
indexed
in
four
scientific
digital
libraries
which
were
filtered
systematically
using
exclusion
inclusion
semi-automatic
and
manual
methods
our
review
emphasizes
three
key
points
the
current
domain
structure
in
terms
of
the
learning
contents
the
vr
design
elements
and
the
learning
theories
as
a
foundation
for
successful
vr-based
learning
the
mapping
was
conducted
between
application
domains
and
learning
contents
and
between
design
elements
and
learning
contents
our
analysis
has
uncovered
several
gaps
in
the
application
of
vr
in
the
higher_education
sphere—for
instance
learning
theories
were
not
often
considered
in
vr
application
development
to
assist
and
guide
toward
learning
outcomes
furthermore
the
evaluation
of
educational
vr
applications
has
primarily
focused
on
usability
of
the
vr
apps
instead
of
learning
outcomes
and
immersive
vr
has
mostly
been
a
part
of
experimental
and
development
work
rather
than
being
applied
regularly
in
actual
teaching
nevertheless
vr
seems
to
be
a
promising
sphere
as
this
study
identifies
18
application
domains
indicating
a
better
reception
of
this
technology
in
many
disciplines
the
identified
gaps
point
toward
unexplored
regions
of
vr
design
for
education
which
could
motivate
future
work
in
the
field
recently
the
term
“fake
news”
has
been
broadly
and
extensively
utilized
for
disinformation
misinformation
hoaxes
propaganda
satire
rumors
click-bait
and
junk
news
it
has
become
a
serious
problem
around
the
world
we
present
a
new
system
fands
that
detects
fake
news
efficiently
the
system
is
based
on
several
concepts
used
in
some
previous
works
but
in
a
different
context
there
are
two
main
concepts
an
inconsistency
graph
and
energy
flow
the
inconsistency
graph
contains
news
items
as
nodes
and
inconsistent
opinions
between
them
for
edges
energy
flow
assigns
each
node
an
initial
energy
and
then
some
energy
is
propagated
along
the
edges
until
the
energy
distribution
on
all
nodes
converges
to
illustrate
fands
we
use
the
original
data
from
the
fake
news
challenge
fnc-1
first
the
data
has
to
be
reconstructed
in
order
to
generate
the
inconsistency
graph
the
graph
contains
various
subgraphs
with
well-defined
shapes
that
represent
different
types
of
connections
between
the
news
items
then
the
energy
flow
method
is
applied
the
nodes
with
high
energy
are
the
candidates
for
being
fake
news
in
our
experiments
all
these
were
indeed
fake
news
as
we
checked
each
using
several
reliable
web
sites
we
compared
fands
to
several
other
fake
news
detection
methods
and
found
it
to
be
more
sensitive
in
discovering
fake
news
items
this
study
focuses
on
whether
network
media
information
about
the
covid-19
pandemic
has
had
a
significant
impact
on
the
online
knowledge
acquisition
of
college
students
this
research
is
of
great
significance
as
it
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
way
we
think
about
knowledge
acquisition
in
the
future
yet
a
recent
literature
review
finds
that
the
academic
community
has
not
paid
attention
to
this
important
topic
in
the
present
work
which
is
based
on
a
survey
of
5000
chinese
college
students
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
period
we
find
that
covid-19
information
from
mainstream
chinese
media
and
overseas
media
as
well
as
social
media
has
had
a
significant
promoting
effect
on
the
online
knowledge
acquisition
of
college
students
at
the
same
time
the
psychological
response
to
the
pandemic
situation
is
shown
to
have
had
a
significant
mediating
effect
on
the
relationship
between
the
information
impact
from
mainstream
chinese
and
overseas
media
and
the
online
knowledge
acquisition
of
college
students
our
findings
have
shown
that
the
more
positive
college
students
are
in
responding
to
the
pandemic
the
stronger
their
willingness
is
to
acquire
knowledge
through
online
means
and
the
better
effect
this
will
have
on
them
acquiring
knowledge
the
results
of
this
paper
have
important
implications
for
the
optimization
and
improvement
of
college
students’
education
and
knowledge
acquisition
methods
in
the
context
of
the
long-term
covid-19
pandemic
the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
how
the
“making

can
enhance
children’s
maker
literacy
and
teachers’
understanding
of

the
program
was
carried
out
in
two
kindergartens
in
china
for
three
months
and
involved
407
children
and
24

kindergarten
were
either
assigned
to
the
makerspace
condition
or
the

showed
significant
improvements
in

finding
solving
hands-on
creative
design
and
communication
skills
among
the
children
in
the
makerspace
condition
compared
to
the
control
condition
the
study
revealed
that
children
in
4-
and
5-year-old
classes
were
proficient
in
using
the
engineering
design
process
in
maker
activities
but
this
was
not
the
case
for
3-year-old
classes
the
teachers
also
reported
positive
experiences
with
the
mm
program
this
study
highlights
the
effectiveness
of
makerspaces
in

and
provides
a
practical
case
for
implementing

is
still
contested
and
its

remains
unclear
therefore
this

speech
imagery
has
been
successfully
employed
in
developing
brain–computer
interfaces
because
it
is
a
novel
mental

that
generates
brain

more
intuitively
than
evoked
potentials
or
motor
imagery
there
are
many
methods
to
analyze
speech
imagery
signals
but
those
based
on
deep
neural
networks
achieve
the
best
results
however
more
research
is
necessary
to
understand
the
properties
and
features
that
describe
imagined
phonemes
and

in
this

we
analyze
the
statistical

eeg
signals
from
the
karaone

to
design
a
method
that
classifies
imagined
phonemes
and

with
this
analysis
we
propose
a
capsule
neural
network
that
categorizes
speech

into
bilabial

the

in
todays

where
digital

form
the
core
of

the
ability

is
becoming
crucial
this

systematically
examines
the

digital
literacy
to
establish
a
conceptual
foundation
for
assessing
an
individuals
platform
literacy
drawing
upon
insights
from
the

framework
we
propose
a
platform

framework
that
can
be
applied
in
practical
settings
methodologically
we
conducted
an
extensive
review
of
735
research
papers
on
digital

to
gather
definitions
and
frameworks
as
a
result
we
identified
seven
core
constructs

three
main
proficiencies
that
constitute
the

framework
moreover
to
adapt
the
framework
to
the
various
digital

contexts
we
categorized
it
into
fixed
and

attributes
this

contributes
to
the
growing
body
of

by
offering
a
comprehensive
framework
for
understanding
platform
literacy
within

landscape
researchers
can
use

approach
to
produce
sustainable

linguistically
diverse

we
provide
our

narrative
for
creating

community
members
n

to
learn
about
their
past
and
present
intergenerational
grocery-shopping

and
integrated
their

this
paper
outlines
the
pd
process
we
undertook
and
its
implications
for
the
field
of
developmental
psychology
we
argue
that
developmental
psychologists
would
benefit
from
adopting
pd
as
a
methodology
to
build
on
diverse
populations
strengths
this
approach
can
produce

the
chapter
aims
to
propose
a
conceptual
framework
of
metabolomics
in
public
health
as
metabolomics
between
the
many
post-genomic
study
methods
has
a
true
horizontal
approach
because
it
studies
the
universe
of
the
small
molecules
it
unravels
signals
which
are
downstream
from
genes
and
much
more
near
to
the
phenotype
phenomena
of
a
disease
or
condition
to
address
these
concepts
a
number
of
themes
are
discussed
namely
the
data
integration
at
different
levels
the
relationship
of
metabolomics
with
the
systems
biology
public
health
science
the
relevance
and
role
of
longitudinal
and
lifelong
studies
the
role
of
the
quantitative
methods
the
connection
with
big
data
in
public
health
with
the
possible
evolution
towards
a
“precision
public
health”
and
finally
the
process
of
knowledge
integration
in
the
fields
of
policies
training
and
resources
with
the
final
goal
of
a
strong
translation
of
metabolomic
tools
from
research
to
practice
micro-controllers
like
arduino
are
increasingly
used
in
classroom
settings
to
teach
skills
attitudes
and
knowledge
around
technology
education
around
these
tools
is
often
set
in
group
contexts
and
collaboration
is
typically
considered
an
important
part
of
the
learning
process
however
much
of
the
software
tools
currently
available
are
still
designed
around
a
laptop
programming
paradigm
that
tends
to
restrict
collaboration
rather
than
encourage
shifting
of
roles
and
sharing
of
experiences
this
paper
explores
how
to
design
tools
that
invite
collaborative
interactions
in
particular
how
mobile
software
tools
with
heavy
usage
of
video
as
an
interactive
resource
could
allow
for
collaborative
sketching
and
understanding
based
on
contextual
inquiries
with
educators
observations
and
engagements
with
students
in
classroom
settings
and
a
workshop
with
arduino
education
this
paper
sketches
out
a
vision
for
how
the
software
tools
used
for
learning
physical
computing
can
be
re-designed
to
better
work
within
the

the

revealed
that
two-level

are
mostly
used
in

moreover
most
e-learning

included
two-level

based
on
our
review
results
we
provide
suggestions
and
potential
applications
of
using
multilevel
modeling
in
e-learning
studies
we
give
an
operational
semantics
for
the
evaluation
of
spreadsheets
including
sheet-defined
and
built-in
numeric
functions
in
the
funcalc
spreadsheet
platform
the
semantics
allows
for
different
implementations
and
we
discuss
sheet-defined
functions
implemented
using
both
interpretation
and
run-time
code
generation
the
semantics
specifies
the
expected
result
of
a
computation
also
considering
non-deterministic
functions
independently
of
an
evaluation
mechanism
it
can
be
extended
to
include
the
cost
of
formula
evaluation
for
a

analysis
eg
for

an
interesting
future
direction
is
to
investigate
experimentally
how
close
our
semantics
is
to
that

this

and
the
factors
that
were

it
was
found
that
the
research
focuses
more
on
users
acting
as
consumers
of
the
glasses
than
on
professionals
eg
doctors

athletes
using
them
in

moreover
the
research
models
of
these

extend
tam
by
using
various
additional
variables
such
as

methodologically
speaking
most
of
the
studies
follow
the
quantitative
approach
without
giving
the
participants
the
opportunity
to
interact
with
the

in
addition
the
factors
which
were

to
influence
the

still
requires
a
deeper
understanding
of

examined
the

emerge
as

was
found
to
be

involves
the

our
findings
indicate
that
both

showing
an
average
increase
of
35

more
on

additionally
data
on
student-reported
weekly

showed
that
in
both
gbp
conditions
students
with
medium
gaming

showed
the
most
improvement
compared
to
those
with

there
was

a
potential

in
that
the

is
a
well-researched
topic
but
more
focus
is
needed
on
the
important
role
of
play
in
child–robot
interaction
play
is
essential
to
how
children

and
thereby
presents
both
opportunities
and
challenges
for
designers
who
aim
to
create
positive
experiences
for

we
present
a
study
investigating
how
a
simple
play-facilitating
cardboard
robot
becomes
a
social

and
create
meaningful
and
playful
experiences
for
preschool
children
we
observed
214

free
play
with
the
robot
the
analysis
produced
four
social
interaction
themes
and
five
play
patterns
illustrating
the
most
salient
reactions
the
results
show
that
the
robot
was
successful
in
enabling
play
and
that
the
children
indeed
treated
the
robot
both
as
a
social
agent
but
also
as
a
material
object
in
line
with
existing
research
our
observations
suggest
that
the
children
attributed
both
animate
and
inanimate
properties
to
the
robot
possibly
explaining
the
duality
of
the
observed
playground
behavior
we
use
these
findings
to
provide
four
implications
for
the
design
of
play-facilitating
robots
as
researchers
focus
more
on
engaging
youth
with
advanced
technologies
to
build

there
is
a
need
to
develop

that
support
youth
to
become

this

is
different
in
that
it

thereby
providing
a
more

we
explore
these

we
examine
consumer

we
draw
on

by
distinguishing
between

we
conclude
that
controlling

the
limited
usage
of
this

been
reported
as
some

this
is
due

a

our

highlights
core
challenges
in
ai

and
the
content
assessment
and
pedagogy
used
in
real
interventions
over
recent
years
we
find
that
efforts
to
teach
ai
ethics
do
helpfully
draw
on
a
holistic
view
as
opposed
to
a
narrow
view
and
utilize
progressive
pedagogies
like
case
studies
and
group
projects
that
aim
to
meaningfully
challenge
students’
ethical
reasoning
skills
in

however
many
real-
world
ai
ethics
teaching
interventions
do
not
leverage
well-supported
assessment
techniques
known
to
support
student
learning
rather
assessment
is
conducted
primarily
for
research
evaluative
purposes
this
gap
in
rigorous
assessment
raises
implications
for
researchers
and
practitioners
as
responsible
development
and
use
of
ai
will
be
stymied
if

cannot
successfully
determine
whether

ai
ethics
content
or

we
conducted
a
mixed-methods
systematic

from
2009
to

to
unpack

conceptualizations
about
approaches
toward

in
place
that
framed

findings
revealed
that
equitable
learning
with
technology
was
conceptualized
as
1
lifting
students
up
through
a
neoliberal
perspective
2
attending
to
individual
needs
3
empowering
students’
agency
and
civic
participation
and
4
providing
equal

opportunities
technology
approaches
and
environmental
supports
in
tandem
with
these
four
conceptualizations
are
articulated
finally
we
discuss
the
need
for
teachers
to
be
reflective
practitioners
and
critical
enquirers
when
leveraging
technology
to
promote
equitable
learning
developing
interdisciplinary
undergraduate
courses
is
challenging
at
all
levels
it
requires
involving
trained
faculty
who
can
successfully
cover
more
than
one
discipline
and
creating
a
new
curriculum
that
crosses
discipline
boundaries
while
such
integrative
curricula
are
expected
in
a
graduate
school
setting
they
are
challenging
at
the
undergraduate
level
since
they
require
proficiency
in
multiple
disciplines
however
making
this
transition
to
interdisciplinary
project-based
teaching
at
the
undergraduate
level
gives
a
competitive
edge
to
undergraduates
as
part
of
a
broader
effort
of
developing
a
comprehensive
neuroscience
curriculum
we
implemented
an
interdisciplinary
one-semester

designed
to
gradually
increase
the
undergraduates’
ability
to
apply

to
solving
biologically-relevant

the
class
brings
together
two
different
groups
of

with
very
dissimilar

the
teamwork
allows

a
growing
number
of

have
shown
that
the
exploratory

nature
of

activities
create
opportunities
for
learners
to
engage
with

in
a
uniquely
different
way
from
traditional

which
largely
relies
on
de-contextualized

the
increased
integration
of

has
enormous
implications
not
only
for
instructional
design
but
also
for

have
the
potential
to
shed

2
in
what

revealed
several

experienced
the
advantages
of

and
for
helping

have
provided

this

offers
practical

the

pdc12
represents
an
effort
to
bring
more
parallel
computing
concepts
into
early
computer
science
courses
to
date
it
has
been
moderately
successful
with
the
inclusion
of
some
pdc
topics
in
the
acmieee
computer
science
curriculum
guidelines
in
2013
cs13
and
mentions
of
pdc
topics
in
the

curricula
2020
additionally
some
universities
in
the
us
and
around
the
world
have
started
to
cover
some
of
these
topics
in
early
cs
courses
lack
of
knowledge
of
or
training
in
pdc
topics
among
instructors
along
with
the
need
to
align
early
cs
course
content
with
prescribed
learning
objectives
in
the
curricula
are
often
cited
as
hurdles
for
adoption
in
early
cs
courses
there
have
been
attempts
at
bringing
pdc
materials
such
as
textbook
chapters
lecture
slides
assignments
and
demos
to
assist
instructors
of
early
cs
classes
however
the
effort
required
on
the
part
of
the
instructor
to
figure
out
what
is
relevant
to
a
particular
class
can
be
daunting
in
this
work
we
contend
that
simultaneously
classifying
pedagogical
materials
against
the
cs13
and
the
pdc12
curriculum
guidelines
can
address
some
of
the
challenges
faced
by
instructors
and
can
promote
broader
adoption
of
pdc
materials
in
early
cs
courses
we
present
cs
materials
a
system
that
can
be
used
to
categorize
pedagogical
materials
according
to
well-known
and
established
curricular
guidelines
we
show
that
cs
materials
can
be
leveraged
1
by
instructors
of
early
cs
courses
to
find
materials
that
are
similar
to
the
one
that
they
use
but
that
also
cover
pdc
topics
and
2
by
instructors
to
check
the
coverage
of
topics
and
gaps
in
a
course
and
3
by
pdc
experts
to
identify
topics
for
which
pdc
instructional
materials
do
not
exist
or
are
insufficient
in
order
to
inform

pokémon
go
has
attracted
huge
numbers
of
players
causing
a
boom
in
this
game
market
although
it
is
not
as
popular
as
before
from
time
to
time
we
still
find
crowds
of

gathered
in
some
spots
where
pokémon
appear
numerous
reports
have
explored
this
pokémon
phenomenon
however
the
exact
reasons
for
its
popularity
remain
unknown
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
explore
the
post-adoption
behavior
of
pokémon
go
players
and
its
influential
factors
in
the
gaming
and
tourism
industries
the
theoretical
model
of
stimulus-organism-response
was
drawn
on
to
examine
the
impact
of
the
environmental
stimuli
social
influence
and
media
influence
on
players’
internal
organisms
which
in
turn
affect
their
post-experience
responses
moreover
gender
differences
were
also
examined
in
the
hypothetical
relationships
a
total
of
342
valid
questionnaires
from
actual
gamers
were
collected
in
this
study
and
data
analysis
was
performed
using
a
structural_equation_model
the
results
show
that
stimulus
effects
such
as
social
stimuli
critical
mass
and
social
interaction
and
media
stimuli
content
timeliness
and
media
richness
have
significant
impacts
on
the
players’
internal
gamified
experience
attachment
and
conformity
which
in
turn
affect
their
visit
intention
to
catch
creatures
at
certain
attractions
and
to
continue
playing
pokémon
go
further
we
have
also
found
that
players’
intention
to
visit
pokémon
spots
is
significantly
correlated
with
their
intention
to
continue
playing
the
game
findings
provide
links
between
gamification
and
tourism
literature

“big
data”
is
a
term
that
has
been
used
often
in
the
past
decade
to
describe
datasets
that
are
extremely
large
and
complex
so
that
traditional
software
is
unable
to
store
and
analyze
them
in
an
accurate
way
it
can
refer
to
“long

“wide

and
both
big

we
discuss
the
challenges
and
possible
solutions
posed
to
biomedical
research
by
our
increasing
ability
to
collect

important
challenges
include
1
the
need
for
standardization
of

content
format
and
clinical
definitions
adhering
to
the
fair
guiding
principles
2
the
need
for
collaborative
networks
with
sharing
of
both

and
expertise
for
example
through
a
federated
approach
3
stricter
privacy
and

and
4
a
need
to
reconsider
how
and
when
analytic

data
science
is
taught
to
medical

overcoming
these
challenges
will
help

prioritizing
children’s
empowerment
in

has
been
on
the
agenda
of
child–computer

cci
research
for
a
long
time
recently
the
notion
of
the
computational
empowerment
of
children
has
received
attention
however
there
are
still
open
issues
in
our
understanding
and
advocacy
of
it
a
related
development
is
the
recent
interest
in
the
longer-term
impacts
of
our
work
fast
and
furious
participation
of
children
in
design
sessions
is
considered
inadequate
we
should
advocate
for
longer-term
trajectories
and
possibilities
for
children
to
make
changes
that
will
influence
our
world
however
the
literature
is
limited
in
addressing
longer-term
impacts
this
study
taps
into
these
two
research
gaps
and
showcases
how
we
have
addressed
the
computational
empowerment
of
children
in
a
project
tackling
bullying
at
school
through
critical
design
and
making
in
this
paper
we
examine
in
detail
the
children’s
designs
and
their
trajectories
from
the
viewpoint
of
empowerment
and
impact
whether
and
how
these
children’s
designs
show
potential
for
the
empowerment
of
those
bullied
and
whether
and
how
their
designs
have
had
an
impact
in
the
realm
of
digital

development
our
study
has
interesting
conceptual
and
methodological
implications
for
cci
research
and
practice
on
the
computational
empowerment
of
children
and
on
our
design
research

one
of
the
aims
of
this
work
is
to
revise
the
known
issues
of
how
to
obtain
the
value
of
the
expression
using
an
applicative
computing
system
computation
andor
symbolic
transformations
have
undoubtedly
become
one
of
the
dominant
trends
in
modern
computer
science
in
particular
this
refers
to
the
execution
of
the
processes
of
inference
of
an
object
with
given
properties
which
is
studied
with
the
formation
of
sets
of
equalities
leading
to
a
target
computational
model
at
the
same
time
the
mathematical
theory
of
computation
gets
a
target
equational
description
making
the
process
of
studying
its
properties
and
capabilities
more
suitable
a
model
structure
based
on
the
method
of
indexed
expressions
is
developed
and
applied
using
the
notions
of
evaluation
mapping
and
assignments
as
shown
this
may
not
be
considered
as
generic
notion
but
derived
using
the
combinators
thus
the
semantics
of
computation
can
be
derived
from
the
construction
of
a
combinator-as-process
this
is
the
embedding
into
a
system
of
combinators
a
linking
system
of
equalities
between
combinatorsl
is
established
which
serving
as
a
generic
computational
model
this
allows
us
to
look
differently
at
the
previous
cognitive
ideas
of
the
semantics
of
computation
disabling
an
evaluation
map
and
assignments
and
enabling
their
replacement
by
a
set
of
equalities
between
combinators
there
is
a
revitalized
interest
in
power
and
politics
around
design
and
technology
in
the
human–computer
interaction
hci
field
child–computer

cci
research
community
has
also
shown
arousing
interest
towards
the
topic
however
despite
this
emerging
interest
the
cci
research
community
has
remained
quite
silent
about
the
potential
of
a
critical
agenda
for
cci
few
studies
have
explicitly
addressed
critical
research
or
critical

this
study
introduces
the
notion
of
a
critical
agenda
for
cci
research
and
identifies
cci
studies
that
are
linked
with
the
critical
agenda
revealing
that
there
are
cci
studies
showing
emerging
interests
and
seeds
for
addressing
the
critical
agenda
overall
this
study
explores
the
state-of-the-art
critical
research
tradition
in
cci
and
explicates
the
potential
of
this
tradition
for
making
the
world
a
better
place
through
design
and
technology
in
collaboration
with
children
from
a
network
perspective
self-regulated

can
be
conceptualized
as
networks
of
mutually
interacting
self-regulatory
learning
behaviors
nevertheless
the
research
on
how
srl
behaviors
dynamically
interact
over

in
a
network
architecture
is
still
in
its
infancy
especially
in
the
context
of
stem
sciences
technology
engineering
and
math
learning
in
the
present

we
used
a

we
examined
how

differed
in

actual

we
found
that
the
three
groups
had
no
significant
difference
in
their
perceived

competency
however
they
differed
in

behaviors
of
evaluation
both
the
mastery-oriented

success-oriented
groups
performed
more
evaluation

than
the
unsuccessful

moreover
the
mastery-oriented
group
showed
stronger

between

than
the
success-oriented

and
the

the

of
the
three

shared
some

but
they
were

we
present

autistic

are
thought
to
develop
social

skills
differently
from
non-autistic
children
previous
work
has
shown
that
technology
and
specifically
tangible
toys
could
have
the
potential
to
support
social
attention
in
autistic
children
a
key
challenge
is
knowing
how
to
design
and
use
interactive
and
intelligent
technologies
to
support
interaction
in
autistic
children
given
the
heterogeneity
in
levels
of
social
motivation
social
development
and
interest
in
digital
technologies
to
address
this
challenge
we
examined
in
detail
the
interaction
between
digital
features
and
autistic
children’s
joint
engagement
in
a
real-world
setting
exploring
the
impact
of
tangible
constraints
in
fostering
social
interaction
the
current
study
observed
autistic
children
aged
between
12
and
15
years
playing
with
a
digital
robotic
toy
and
a
non-digital
counterpart
and
measured
social
attention
and
engagement
during
free
play
the
results
showed
that
increased
and
higher
levels
of
joint
attention
when
children
had
to
share
a
toy
between
them
on
both
digital
and
non-digital
interfaces
we
found
that
autistic
children
individually
vary
in
their
propensity
to
engage
in
social
interactions
as
well
as
their
responses
to
digital
features
this
work
contributes
to
a
growing
area
of
evidence
that
tangible
and
smart
technologies
can
create
social
opportunities
for
autistic

the
covid-19

has
resulted

in

of

is
an

although
both

yet
they
have
not
been
considered
simultaneously
in
one
work
for
the

attempts
to

that
is
prevalent
particularly
in

countries
like

and
whether
it

show
that

several

ii
a

the

iii
the

seems
not
a

the

implications
of
these

along
with
the
effects
of

interact
with
natural

including
soil
weathering
and

together
these
processes
create
a
constantly
shifting
dynamic
terrestrial
environment
that
violates
the
assumption
of
stationarity
commonly
applied
in
hydrology
consequently
hydrologists
need
to
rethink
both
statistical
and
calibrated
models
to
account
for
complex
environmental
processes
we
review
the
literature
on
human-landscape-hydrological
interactions
to
identify
processes
and

that
influence

most
of
the
papers

consider
only
a
few
of
these
processes
at
a
time
and
focus
on
structural
attributes
of
the

rather
than
the
short

we
identify
challenges
in

could
combine
to
drive
long-term

recognizing
that
some
important
questions
remain
unaddressed
by
traditional

we
suggest
the
concept
of
‘big

in
which
multifaceted
experiments
are
conducted
in
the

by
artificially
inducing

these

summary
the

shifts
may
be
driven
by
humans
directly
eg

climate
change
that
causes

are
natural
such
as
certain
soil

this

our

synthesizes
a
wide

that
have
wide-ranging

on
the

scales
along
with

our
main
models
of
computation
the
turing
machine
and
the
ram
and
most
modern
computer
architectures
make
fundamental
assumptions
about
which
primitive
operations
are
realizable
on
a
physical
computing
device
the
consensus
is
that
these
primitive
operations
include
logical
operations
like
conjunction
disjunction
and
negation
as
well
as
reading
and
writing
to
a
large
collection
of
memory
locations
this
perspective
conforms
to
a
macro-level
view
of
physics
and
indeed
these
operations
are
realizable
using
macro-level
devices
involving
thousands
of
electrons
this
point
of
view
is
however
incompatible
with
computation
realized
using
quantum
devices
or
analyzed
using
elementary
thermodynamics
as
both
these
fundamental
physical
theories
imply
that
information
is
a
conserved
quantity
of
physical
processes
and
hence
of
primitive
computational
operations
our
aim
is
to
redevelop
foundational
computational
models
in
a
way
that
embraces
the
principle
of
conservation
of
information
we
first
define
what
information
is
and
what
its
conservation
means
in
a
computational
setting
we
emphasize
the
idea
that
computations
must
be
reversible
transformations
on
data
one
can
think
of
data
as
modeled
using
topological
spaces
and
programs
as
modeled
by
reversible
deformations
of
these
spaces
we
then
illustrate
this
idea
using
three
notions
of
data
and
their
associated
reversible
computational
models
the
first
instance
only
assumes
unstructured
finite
data
ie
discrete
topological
spaces
the
corresponding
notion
of
reversible
computation
is
that
of
permutations
we
show
how
this
simple
model
subsumes
conventional
computations
on
finite
sets
we
then
consider
a
modern
structured
notion
of
data
based
on
the
curry–howard
correspondence
between
logic
and
type
theory
we
develop
the
corresponding
notion
of
reversible
deformations
using
a
sound
and
complete
programming
language
for
witnessing
type
isomorphisms
and
proof
terms
for
commutative
semirings
we
then
“move
up
a
level”
to
examine
spaces
that
treat
programs
as
data
which
is
a
crucial
notion
for
any
universal
model
of
computation
to
derive
the
corresponding
notion
of
reversible
programs
between
programs
ie
reversible
program
equivalences
we
look
at
the
“higher
dimensional”
analog
to
commutative
semirings
symmetric
rig
groupoids
the
coherence
laws
for
these
groupoids
turn
out
to
be
exactly
the
sound
and
complete
reversible
program
equivalences

seek
we
conclude
with
some
possible
generalizations

theory

coding
is
a
highly
valued
skill
used
in
many
disciplines
across
the
globe
however
it
is
reported
that
students’
coding
interest
and
self-efficacy
are
usually
low
theoretically
the
affective
domain
of
coding
is
in
its
infancy
and
very
few
studies
have
set
out
to
identify
the
determinants
of
coding
interest
and
self-efficacy
this
study
explored
how
mathematics
interest
and
self-efficacy
as
two
important
mathematics-related
factors
influenced
coding
interest
and
self-efficacy
employing
a
quantitative
cross-sectional
survey
design
605
students
from

in
china
were
investigated
a
two-step

modeling
approach
was
adopted
to
analyze
the
data
findings
showed
that
mathematics
interest
directly
and
indirectly
influenced
coding

significantly
in
addition
coding
self-efficacy
was
indirectly
impacted

mathematics
interest
and
coding
interest
was
indirectly

self-efficacy
significantly
most
importantly
our

proved
to
be

this

there

this

of
these
pioneering

the
technological
revolution
particularly
the
availability

has
led
to
the
emergence
of
a
new
scientific
field
called
“computational

our
work
tries
to
define
its
scope
and
focuses
on
a
popular
subarea
of
it
namely
“digital
democracy”
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
surge
of
interest
in
using
digital
technologies
to
promote
more
participatory
forms
of
democracy
while
there
are
numerous
potential
benefits
to
using
digital

to
enhance
democracy
significant
challenges
must
be
addressed
it
is
essential
to
ensure
that
digital

are
used
in
an
accessible
equitable
and
fair
manner
rather
than
reinforcing
existing
power
imbalances
this
paper
investigates
how
digital
tools
can
be
used
to
help
design
more
democratic
societies
by
investigating
three
key
research
areas
1
the
role
of
digital
technologies
for
facilitating
civic
engagement
in
collective
decision-making
2
the
use
of
digital
tools
to
improve
transparency
and
accountability
in
governance
and
3
the
potential
for
digital
technologies
to
enable
the
formation
of
more
inclusive
and
representative
democracies
we
argue
that
more
research
on
how
digital
technologies
can
be
used
to
support
democracy
upgrade
is
needed
along
these
lines
we
lay
out
a
research
agenda
for
the
future
storytelling
support
has
been
and
continues
to
be
a
recurring
theme
in
child–computer
interaction
research
especially
as
it
pertains
to
education
this
work
has
spilled
over
into
practice
and
in
the
last
few
decades
a
large
number
of
storytelling
systems
for
children
have
been
developed—both
as
research
prototypes
and
commercial
applications
however
through
a
systematic
analysis
of
75
research-based
storytelling
systems
and
39
commercial
systems
we
find
that
there
remains
a
problematic
gap
between
research
and
practice
with
respect
to
products
in
interactive
storytelling
and
child–computer
interaction
echoing
the
well-documented
research-practice
gap
in
the
general
hci
field
we
characterize
the
nature
of
this
gap
highlighting
design
themes
promoted
by
research-based
systems
that
are
not
as
prevalent
in
commercial
systems
such
as
tangibility
and
narrative
scaffolds
and
vice-versa
understanding
the
main
areas
of
discrepancy
between
research
and
practice
can
help
focus
efforts
to
close
the
research-practice
gap
in
storytelling
systems
for
children
digital
technology
has
brought
new
opportunities
for
language
education
multimodal
literacy
refers
to
the
ability
to
read
watch
understand
respond
to
and
generate
multimodal
texts
multimodality
promoted
by
scholars
generates
meaning
in
multiple
modes
hence
digital
storytelling
dst
presented
with
multimodal
content
has
been
extensively
applied
in
second
language
instruction
however
traditional
dst
is
mostly
presented
in
videos
with
one-way
communication
it
lacks
two-way
communication
with
the
audience
and
is
only
regarded
as
a
learning
method
for
knowledge
acquisition
as
a
result
the
present
study
proposed
a
robot-based
dst
robot-dst
approach
to
facilitate
the
interaction
in
the
dst
process
and
to
enhance
students
engagement
in
order
to
evaluate
its
effectiveness
a
quasi-experiment
was
conducted
in
an
efl
course
at
a
senior
high_school
two
classes
of
11th
graders
participated
in
the
experiment
one
class
with
40
students
was
the
experimental
group
adopting
the
robot-dst
approach
while
the
other
class
with
40
students
was
the
control
group
adopting
the
conventional
animation-based
dst
ca-dst
approach
the
results
showed
that
the
robot-dst
approach
could
significantly
reduce
students
communication
apprehension
as
well
as
enhance
their
english
speaking
ability
storytelling
ability
narrative
engagement
and
communication
tendency
the
findings
show
that
using
robots
in
the
context
of
digital
storytelling
design
has
great
potential
for
promoting
learners’
language
learning
performances
accordingly
in-depth

and
suggestions
for
future
research
are
provided
for
researchers
and
school
teachers
who
intend
to
use

context
model-driven
approaches
are
increasingly
used
in
different
domains
such
as
education
finance
and
app
development
in
order
to
involve
non-developers
in
the
software
development
process
such

are
hugely
dependent
on

and
thus
might
not
be

analyse
existing
literature
on
the
accessibility
of

their
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
key
directions
for
future
research
methods
we
carried
out
a
systematic

review
and
searched
through
five
leading

we
used
both
quantitative

after
reviewing

conducting
both
backward

we
identified

our
analysis
we
found
most

conclusion
limited
work
has
been
done
on
improving

the
findings
of
this
systematic

will
assist
researchers
and

in
understanding
the

the
forensic
science
undergraduate
program
fsup
at
the
national
autonomous
university
of
mexico
was
created
in
response
to
an
alarming
criminal
situation
in
mexico
as
well
as
to
the
radical
reform
of
its
criminal
justice
system
its
mission
is
to
educate
and
train
ethical
critical
and
humanistic
forensic
scientists
capable
of
conducting
inquiries
that
meet
scientific
quality
standards
and
assist
the
justice
system
in
firmly
linking
legal
rulings
to
the
available
evidence
at
the
time
it
was
the
first
such
program
in
the
country
and
the
contributions
that
interdisciplinary
forensic
scientists
could
make
to
criminal
investigations
were
largely
unknown
among
forensic
and
legal
practitioners
during
its
existence
providing
an
interdisciplinary
competence-based
education
to
students
has
been
one
of
the
main
challenges
to
overcome
it
teaching
and
assessment
approaches—centered
on
the
achievement
of
specifically
forensic
competencies
as
learning
outcomes
and
the
integration
of
forensic
disciplines
towards
the
resolution
of
simulated
cases—have
been
devised
to
help
develop
the
professional
skill
set
expected
of
graduates
the
covid-19
pandemic
led
to
adapting
these
approaches
to
distance
or
hybrid
modes
of
learning
increasing
their
versatility
and
enriching
the
pedagogic
repertoire
of
the
fsup
currently
the
main
impact
of
the
program
lies
in
the
successful
incorporation
of
some
of
its
graduates
to
agencies
belonging
to
or
related
to
the
criminal
justice
system
such
as
the
national
prosecutor’s
office
the
commission
for
truth
and
justice
for
the
ayotzinapa
case
and
the
national
commission
for
the

among
others
motion-based
learning
technologies
mblt
offer
a
promising
approach
for
integrating
play
and
problem-solving
behaviour
within
children’s
learning
the
proliferation
of
sensor
technology
has
driven
the
field
of
learning
technology
towards
the
development
of
tools
and
methods
that
may
benefit
from
the
produced
multi-modal
data
mmd
such
data
can
be
used
to
uncover
cognitive
affective
and
physiological
processes
during
learning
activities
combining
mmd
with
more
traditionally
exercised
assessment
tools
such
as
video
content
analysis
provides
a
more
holistic
understanding
of
children’s
learning
experiences
and
has
the
potential
to
enable
the
design
of
educational
technologies
capable
of
harmonising
children’s
cognitive
affective
and
physiological
processes
while
promoting
appropriately
balanced
play
and
problem-solving
efforts
however
the
use
of
an
mmd
mixed_methods
approach
that
combines
qualitative
and
mmd
data
to
understand
children’s
behaviours
during
engagement
with
mblt
is
rather
unexplored
we
present
an
in-situ
study
where
26
children
ages
10–12
solved
a
motion-based
sorting
task
for
learning
geometry
we
continuously
and
unobtrusively
monitored
children’s
learning
experiences
using
mmd
collection
via
eye-trackers
wristbands
kinect
joint
tracking
and
a
web
camera
we
devised
sp3
a
novel
observational
scheme
that
can
be
used
to
understand
children’s
solo
interactions
with
mblt
and
applied
it
to
identify
and
extract
children’s
evoked
play
and
problem-solving
behaviour
collective
analysis
of
the
mmd
and
video
codes
provided
explanations
of
children’s
task
performance
through
consideration
of
their
holistic
learning
experience
lastly
we
applied
predictive
modelling
to
identify
the
synergies
between
various
mmd
measurements
and
children’s
play
and
problem-solving
behaviours
this
research
sheds
light
on
the
opportunities
offered
in
the
confluence
of
video
coding
a
traditional
method
in
learning
sciences
and
mmd
an
emerging
method
that
leverages

examines
the
uses
of

learning
ml
in
applying
genomic
technologies
to
cancer
research
and
treatment
it
provides
a
brief
overview
of
genomic

that
have
impacted
cancer
research
as
well
as
the
use
of
ml
in
bringing
these
technologies
into
clinical
practice
it
further
reviews
some
notable
successes
in
translating
ml
and
genomics
into
improvements
in
the
practice
of
cancer
treatment
as
well
as
some
current
directions
in
ml
for
cancer

it
then
considers
common
challenges
to
applying
ml
methods
for
cancer
genomics
and
some
general
strategies
for
overcoming
these
challenges
in
practice
it
concludes
with
a
perspective
on
potential
future
directions
for
ml
in
cancer
genomics
and
how
these
may
impact
the
future
of
cancer
treatment
with
the
large-scale
promotion
of
new

the
demand
for
power
batteries
such
as
the
lithium-ion
type
has
increased
its
service
lifespan
is
closely
related
to
the

the
important
embodiment
of
the
service
condition
is
the
battery
state
of

which
can
reflect
its

strategy
can
be
planned
to
realize
the

the
long

can
be
realized
by
adjusting

therefore
real-time
accurate

a
significant
effect
on

is
introduced
to
estimate

strategies
are
introduced
into
the

designing
radiation-tolerant
electronics
and
components
that
are
tolerant
of
the
massive
levels
of
ionizing
radiation
such
as
cosmic
outer
space
radiation
x-ray
radiation
in
medical
or
security
environments
and
high
energy
radiation
within
nuclear
power
plants
in
order
to
test
these
components
and
determine
whether
they
are
sufficiently
hardened
radiation-hardened
electronics
manufacturers
perform
rigorous
testing
as
part
of
their
product
manufacturing
processes
components
which
pass
these
tests
go
into
production
and
can
be
described
as
“radiation-hardened”
components
that
do
not
go
back
to
design
companies
like
ritz
carlton
disney
and
verizon
are
among
many
who
have
invested
in
analytics
to
improve
their
customers
service
experiences
with
the
firms
extensive
data
are
collected
on
all
aspects
of
how
customers
interact
or
experience
the
products
or
services
research
has
shown
the
importance
of
the
“peak-end”
rule
in
service
design
that
is
providing
a
customer
with
good
“peak”
service
levels
and
“ending”
the
service
experience
with
high
quality
can
enhance
customer
satisfaction
and
build
loyalty
however
previous
studies
have
examined
this
phenomenon
only
in
contexts
with
unidimensional
service
levels
we
introduce
peak
cubes
which
enable
service
designers
and
scholars
to
pinpoint
prominent
service
levels
in
multidimensional
service
experience
profiles—thereby
extending
current
research
on
behavioral
economics
and
service
design
to
more
general
settings
results
indicate
the
potential
of
multidimensional
peak-end
models
to
better
predict
customer
satisfaction
in
various
service
scenarios
using
shapley
values
in
coalitional
game
theory
the
resulting
models
can
also
inform
service
designers
about
the
quality
dimensions
that
are
critical
from
the
perspective
of
multidimensional
peak-end
heuristic
and
customer
satisfaction
our
research
contributions
and
proposed
methodology
will
enhance
decision
support
systems
with
multidimensional
capabilities
and
have
applications
to
fields
as
diverse
as
service
operations
and
healthcare
designers
are
entrusted
with
increasingly
complex
and
impactful
challenges
however
the
current
system
of
design
education
does
not
always
prepare
students
for
these
challenges
when
we
examine
what
and
how
our
system
teaches
young
designers
we
discover
that
the
most
valuable
elements
of
the
designer’s
perspective
and
process
are
seldom
taught
instead
some
designers
grow
beyond
their
education
through
their
experience
working
in
industry
essentially
learning
by
accident
many
design
programs
still
maintain
an
insular
perspective
and
an
inefficient
mechanism
of
tacit
knowledge
transfer
meanwhile
skills
for
developing
creative
solutions
to
complex
problems
are
increasingly
essential
organizations
are
starting
to
recognize
that
designers
bring
something
special
to
this
type
of
work
a
rational
belief
based
upon
numerous
studies
that
link
commercial
success
to
a
design-driven
approach
so
what
are
we
to
do
other
learned
professions
such
as
medicine
law
and
business
provide
excellent
advice
and
guidance
embedded
within
their
own
histories
of
professionalization
in
this
article
we
borrow
from
their
experiences
to
recommend
a
course
of
action
for
design
it
will
not
be
easy
it
will
require
a
study
group
to
make
recommendations
for
a
roster
of
design
and
educational
practices
that
schools
can
use
to
build
a
curriculum
that
matches
their
goals
and
abilities
and
then
it
will
require
a
conscious
effort
to
bootstrap
the
design
profession
toward
both
a
robust
practitioner
community
and
an
effective
professoriate
capable
together
of
fully
realizing
the
value
of
design
in
the
21st
century
in
this
article
we
lay
out
that
path
sensory
evaluation
is
predicated
on
the
use
and
interpretation
of
human
language
we
ask
our
subjects
to
describe
their
sensory
experiences
and
affective
responses
which
we
cannot
directly
observe
this
formulation
of
sensory
science
encourages
direct
engagement
with
linguistics
and
in
particular
a
recent
subfield
of
linguistics
computer
science
and
artificial
intelligence
called
“natural
language
processing”
nlp
sometimes
“computational
linguistics”
in
this
chapter
we
will
provide
an
introduction
to
natural
language
processing
nlp
for
sensory
scientists
who
wish
to
employ
nlp
as
a
rapid
method
for
sensory
evaluation
because
nlp
is
a
large
diverse
and
rapidly
evolving
field
we
will
begin
with
a
brief
pragmatic
overview
of
the
discipline
with
an
emphasis
on
key
historical
and
current
methods
and
applications
we
will
then
briefly
discuss
the
linguistic
perspective
and
its
application
to
sensory
evaluation
with
an
aim
to
motivating
the
remaining
chapter
following
that
we
will
discuss
key
areas
of
nlp
from
data
collection
to
processing
to
analysis
to
advanced
applications
throughout
the
chapter
we
will
use
a
consistent
case
study
of
natural-language
descriptions
for
a
food
product
to
provide
examples
and
illustrate
nlp
methods
a
corollary
to
the
exponential
growth
of
digital
technology
is
the
increase
in
research
interest
in
the
construct
of
digital
citizenship
dc
in
diverse
disciplinary
areas
although
the
term
dc
is
used
widely
in
research
scholars
do
not
commit
to
a
common
definition
this
integrative
review
investigates
the
conceptualizations
and
measurements
of
dc
across
disciplines
in
the
extant
literature
a
systematic
search
of
11
databases
identified
a
total
of
350
unique
items
that
contain
“digital
citizenship”
in
the
title
or
keywords
published
by
december
2018
with
the
majority
published
after
2010
of
these
114
were
peer-reviewed
journal
articles
published
in
a
wide
range
of
discipline-specific
venues
more
than
half
of
which
were
education-related
in-depth
analyses
show
that
each
of
the
dominant
conceptualizations
of
dc
has
been
adopted
by
different
disciplines
albeit
with
different
popularities
in
adoption
findings
also
revealed
widely
shared
stakeholder
concerns
and
research
foci
in
dc
research
across
the
disciplines
however
there
is
a
stark
lack
of
empirical
research
on
the
young
children
and
an
absence
of
commonly
deployed
research
instruments
in
dc-related
research
the
present
integrative
review
implicates
the
need
for
interdisciplinary
collaboration
for
significant
advances
in
dc
research
to
address
issues
in
policy
and
practice
this
study
investigates
the
development
of
transversal
skills
and
their
association
with
academic
performance
in
university
students
enrolled
in
on-campus
programs
with
online
activities
a
cross-sectional
descriptive
and
quantitative
research
was
conducted
with
252
students
from
a
public
university
in
mexico
transversal
skills
socioformative
project-based
practices
learning
strategies
and
the
relevance
of
online
activities
were
assessed
using
validated
rubrics
the
results
indicated
a
low
level
of
development
in
three
transversal
skills
research
entrepreneurship
and
english
with
the
latter
being
the
poorest
rated
critical
and
creative
thinking
exhibited
the
highest
level
of
development
in
the
didactic
component
socioformative
project-based
pedagogical
practices
and
learning
strategies
showed
acceptable
levels
students
expressed
satisfaction
with
complementary
online
activities
showing
a
preference
for
interactive
videos
and
short
videos
under
4
min
regression
analysis
and
structural
equations
were
used
to
examine
the
relationships
between
various
factors
results
demonstrated
that
socioformative
project-based
pedagogical
practices
learning
strategies
and
online
education
positively
correlated
with
the
development
of
transversal
skills
furthermore
a
higher
level
of
transversal
skills
was
associated
with
better
academic
averages
among
students
socioformative
project-based
pedagogical
practices
also
correlated
with
academic
performance
through
transversal

the
study
concludes
that
integrating
online
activities
into
on-campus
programs
based
on
the
socioformative
pedagogical
model
can
enhance
the
development
of
transversal
skills
and
improve
academic
performance
further
research
into
the
implementation
of
this
educational
model
and
its
long-term
impact
on
university
education
and
professional
success
is
recommended
it
is
acknowledged
that
technological
innovation
is
needed
in
all
sectors
to
cope
with
new

from
social

it
introduces
novel
ideas
whether

and
foster

the
aim
is
to
enhance

and
elevate
human
well-being
development
of

the
challenge
is
on
human

side
how
quickly
we
can
prepare
employees
to
adapt
to
the
requirements
of

40
and
society

in
the
paper
the

were
identified
with
the
business
stakeholders
by
conducting
a
survey
among

partners
to
recognize
the

the
stakeholders
in
the
construction
field
act
as
target
groups
for
monitoring
and
development
of
the

the
focus
of
the
result
part
is
on
the
competencies
companies
mostly
miss
from
their
employees
from
digital
perspectives
eg
reason
to

expected
to
be

in
21st-century
higher_education

it
is
highly
important
to
consider
the

and
to
adopt
the
engineering

the
learning
process
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
learning
environment
particularly
in
the
case
of
open-ended
learning
environments
where
the
learning
process
is
considered
to
be
non-linear
in
this
paper
we
report
on
the
findings
of
employing
a
multimodal
hidden
markov
model
hmm
based
methodology
to
investigate
the
temporal
learning
processes
of
two
types
of
learners
that
have
learning
gains
and
a
type
that
does
not
have
learning
gains
in
an
open-ended
collaborative_learning
activity
considering
log
data
speech
behavior
affective
states
and
gaze
patterns
we
find
that
all
learners
start
from
a
similar
state
of
non-productivity
but
once
out
of
it
they
are
unlikely
to
fall
back
into
that
state
especially
in
the
case
of
the
learners
that
have
learning
gains
those
who
have
learning
gains
shift
between
two
problem_solving
strategies
each
characterized
by
both
exploratory
and
reflective
actions
as
well
as
demonstrate
speech
and
gaze
patterns
associated
with
these
strategies
that
differ
from
those
who
dont
have
learning
gains
further
the
teams
that
have
learning
gains
also
differ
between
themselves
in
the
manner
in
which
they
employ
the
problem_solving
strategies
over
the
interaction
as
well
as
in
the
manner
they
express
negative
emotions
while
exhibiting
a
particular
strategy
these
outcomes
contribute
to
understanding
the
multiple
pathways
of
learning
in
an
open-ended
collaborative_learning
environment
and
provide
actionable
insights
for
designing
effective
interventions
over
the
years
various
technical
means
have
been
developed
to
protect
internet
users
from
phishing
attacks
to
enrich
the
anti-phishing
efforts
we
capitalise
on
concepts
from
graph
theories
and
propose
a
set
of
novel
graph
features
to
improve
the
phishing
detection
accuracy
the
initial
phase
of
the
proposed
technique
involved
the
extraction
of
hyperlinks
in
the
webpage
under
scrutiny
and
fetching
the
corresponding
neighbourhood
webpages
during
this
process
the
page
linking
data
were
collected
and
used
to
construct
a
web
graph
which
models
the
overall
hyperlink
and
network
structure
of
the
webpage
from
the
web
graph
graph
measures
were
computed
and
extracted
as
graph
features
to
derive
a
classifier
for
detecting
phishing
webpages
experimental
results
show
that
the
proposed
graph
features
achieve
an
improved
overall
accuracy
of
978
when
c45
was
utilised
as
classifier
outperforming
the
existing
conventional
features
derived
from
the
same
data
samples
unlike
conventional
features
the
proposed
graph
features
leverage
inherent
phishing
patterns
that
are
only
visible
at
a
higher
level
of
abstraction
thus
making
it
robust
and
difficult
to
be
evaded
by
direct
manipulations
on
the
webpage
contents
our
proposed
graph-based
technique
also
shows
promising
results
when
benchmarked
against
a
prominent
phishing
detection
technique
hence
the
proposed
technique
is
an
important
contribution
to
the
existing
anti-phishing
research
towards
improving
the
detection
performance
augmented
reality
ar
continues
to
show
its
impact
in
education
while
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
studies
have
synthesized
the
evidence
of
this
impact
most
of
them
did
not
differentiate
how
ar
may
foster
various
learning
outcomes
to
different
degrees
in
this
study
134
quasi-experimental
studies
on
augmented
reality
ar
in
education
from
2012
to
2021
were
reviewed
to
discern
the
impact
of
ar
on
three
levels
of
learning
outcomes
namely
response
knowledge
and
skill
and
performance
the
134
studies
are
the
data
of
this
study
for
meta-analysis
which
were
obtained
following
the
procedure
of
the
preferred
reporting
items
for
systematic
reviews
and
meta-analysis
moreover
meta-regression
was
employed
to
investigate
important
factors
relating
to
the
variation
of
the
impact
including
educational
level
subject
area
treatment
duration
and
ar
affordance
findings
from
the
meta-analysis
suggest
that
ar
technology
has
benefited
all
three
learning
outcomes
with
a
larger
mean
effect
size
on
the
outcome
of
performance
furthermore
the
meta-regression
results
indicate
treatment
duration
as
a
significant
factor
likely
relating
to
the
variation
in
the
impact
of
ar
in
education
moreover
ar
used
to
support
the
learning
of
languages
or
social
studies
is
likely
associated
with
higher
positive
learner
responses
such
as
learning
motivation
or
attitude
than
ar
used
for
science
learning
the
meta-regression
result
indicated
that
use
of
3-d
visualization
in
ar
needs
to
be
carefully
designed
and
evaluated
the
implications
of

the
paper
consists
of
a
discussion
of
the
theoretical

parts
of
case

the
theoretical

was
created
on
the
basis
of
a

was
a
general
framework
for
building
the

of
the

the

the

was
to
develop
a
framework
for
the

the

posed
the
following
research
questions
purposeshypotheses
p1
to
what
extent
do
polish
companies
in
the
metallurgical
sector
pay
attention
to
creativity
and

issues
when
looking
for

p2
to
what

do
the

portfolio
of
metallurgy
graduates
of
polish
technical
universities
turn
their
attention
to
the
issues
related
to
creativity
and
innovation
what
would
it
take
to
build
a
computer
physician
that
can
take
its
place
amongst
human
peers
currently
neural
nets
especially
as
so-called
“deep
learning”
nets
dominate
what
is
popularly
called
“artificial
intelligence”
but
to
many
critics
they
seem
to
be
little
more
than
powerful
data-analytic
tools
inspired
by
some
of
the
more
basic
functions
and
regions
of
the
human
brain
such
as
those
involved
in
early
processes
in
biological
vision
classification
and
categorization
the
deeper
nature
of
human
intelligence
as
the
term
is
normally
meant
including
relating
to
consciousness
has
been
the
domain
of
philosophers
psychologists
and
some
neuroscientists
now
attention
is
turning
to
neuronal
mechanisms
in
humans
and
simpler
organisms
as
a
basis
of
a
truer
ai
with
far
greater
potential
arguably
the
approach
required
should
be
rooted
in
information
theory
and
algorithmic
science
but
as
discussed
in
this
paper
caution
is
required
“just
any
old
information”
might
not
do
the
information
might
need
to
be
of
a
particular
dynamical
and
actioning
nature
and
that
might
significantly
impact
the
kind
of
computation
and
computer
hardware
required

however
the

do
not
favor
emergent

such
as
those

despite
the
possible

such

biodesign
a
speculative
and
creative
offshoot
from
the
field
of
bioengineering
is
an
area
of
stem
that
is
growing
in
popularity
in
education
settings
primarily
because
of
its
unique
interdisciplinary
lens
that
connects
stem
disciplinary
knowledge
and
creative
design
practices
although
this
trend
is
currently
limited
to
middle
school
high_school
and
higher_education
prior
research
suggests
that
children
5
years
and
older
may
yield
long-term
gains
from
exploring
developmentally-appropriate
concepts
from
novel
stem
fields
although
there
is
little
research
on
educational
technologies
or
resources
to
support
young
children’s
curiosity
and
learning
in
this
novel
domain
some
research
suggests
that
young
children
may
already
be
forming
preconceptions
about
genetics
and
biology
eg
from
popular
media
tangible
technologies
which
provide
children
qualitatively
new
developmentally
appropriate
ways
to
engage
with
ideas
and
techniques
have
been
shown
to
support
children’s
engagement
with
foundational
ideas
relevant
to
biodesign
including
the
engineering
design
process
by
applying
developmentally
appropriate
constraints
to
our
technology
development
eg
through
frameworks
such
as
the
positive
technological
development
the
research
team
developed
and
evaluated
a
novel
tangible
technology
called
crispee
to
introduce
young
children
to
concepts
of
biology
and
engineering
this
article
describes
an
experimental
pilot
study
to
investigate
1
how
young
children
interact
with
the
crispee
technological
prototype
and
2
what
prior
knowledge
the
average
child
might
bring
to
an
educational
biodesign
activity
implications
for
ongoing
technology
development
and
developmentally
appropriate
learning
goals
are
discussed
data
visualization
aims
to
convey
quantitative
and
qualitative
information
effectively
by
determining
which
techniques
and
visualizations
are
most
appropriate
for
different
situations
and
why
various
software
solutions
can
produce
numerous
visualizations
of
the
same
data
set
however
data
visualization
encompasses
a
wide
range
of
visual
configurations
that
depend
on
factors
such
as
the
type
of
data
being
displayed
the
different
displays
eg
scatter
plots
line
graphs
and
pie
charts
the
visual
components
used
to
represent
the
data
eg
lines
dots
and
bars
and
the
specific
visual
attributes
of
those
components
eg
color
shape
size
and
length
a
similar
problem
arises
when
designing
data
tables
where
the
dimensionality
of
the
data
and
its
complexity
influence
the
choice
of
the
most
appropriate
structure
eg
unidirectional
bidirectional
often
this
broad
spectrum
of
configurations
requires
a
visualization
expert
who
knows
which
techniques
are
best
for
which
type
of
data
source
and
what
is
to
be
conveyed
typically
researchers
and
developers
lack
knowledge
of
data
visualization
best
practices
and
must
learn
the
design
principles
that
enable
effective
communication
and
the
technical
details
of
the
specific
software
tool
they
use
to
generate
visualizations
this
paper
proposes
a
software
product
line
approach
to
model
and
realize
the
variability
of
the
visualization
design
process
using
feature
models
to
encode
knowledge
about
design
best
practices
in
graphs
and
charts
our
approach
involves
solving
visualization
design
variability
through
a
stepwise
configuration
process
and
evaluating
the
proposal
for
a
specific
software
visualization
tool
our
solution
facilitates
effective
communication
of
quantitative
results
by
helping
researchers
and
developers
select
and
generate
the
most
effective
visualizations
for
each
case
this
approach
opens
up
new
opportunities
for

applies
elements
such
as

these

goals
directly
support

the
idea
that

several
key
considerations
that

have
the
potential
to
overcome
these
barriers
and
lead

conclusions
barriers
in
the
development
of
digital
behavioral
interventions
are
often
created
by
a
lack
of
cross-disciplinary
understanding
which
can
lead
to
difficulties
conceptualizing
interventions
unrealistic
expectations

concerns
about

as
the
translation
of

development
practices
focusing

are
not
in

principles
of

there
is
also
a

which
is
another
principle

remains
a
neglected
area
of

and
the

teachers
in
england
are
required
to
ensure
that
learners
from
the
age
of
five
are
taught
about
algorithms
and
program
design
yet
there
is
evidence
that
despite
teachers
reporting
that
design
is
important
they
are
not
converting
this
into
classroom
practice
this
paper
describes
a
survey
study
in
which
we
explored
teachers’
difficulties
in
using
design
we
surveyed
207
teachers
asking
them
free-text
questions
on
their
use
of
design
in
teaching
programming
and
their
views
of
pupils’
responses
to
using
design
in
the
survey
we
also
investigated
teachers’
understanding
of
the
term
algorithm
an
essential
concept
which
may
be
a
contributing
factor
in
their
difficulties
with
design
we
provide
underpinning
data
on
the
difficulties
of
using
design
that
teachers
of
pupils
aged
from
5
to
11
years
old
grades
k
to
5
have
in
teaching
programming
difficulties
with
design
identified
include
pupil
resistance
a
lack
of
time
a
lack
of
pupil
and
teacher
expertise
conflicting
pedagogical
choices
and
a
general
confusion
over
what
an
algorithm
is
there
were
statistically
significant
differences
in
selection
of
the
term
‘algorithm’
to
describe
programming
artefacts
whether
a
teacher
was
a
specialist
or
a
generalist
what
training
they
had
received
on
programming
or
design
the
age
group
taught
and
programming
language
used
teachers
were
more
likely
to
call
a
complex
code
snippet
an
‘algorithm’
than
a
simpler
one
and
more
likely
to
select
the
term
to
describe
code
snippets
than
a
design
artefact
we
make
suggestions
of
how
to
alleviate
the
problems
including
that
teachers
are
introduced
to
the
idea
of
ambiguous
representations
of
algorithms
and
a
process
which
refines
the
representation
from
ambiguous
to
unambiguous
as
the
design
progresses
embodied
cognition
is
a
concept
that
has
been
extensively
explored
by

however
there
is
a
lack
of
a
synthesis
of
this
research
to
clarify
the
field’s
benefits
and
drawbacks
this

we
retrieved
158

the
purpose
of
this

is
to
provide
an
overview
of
the
current
landscape
of
‘embodied’
research
by
reporting
the
most
common
subject
areas
of
application
forms
and
modes
of

and
the
role
of

our
contribution
is
twofold
we
highlight
the
main
trends
around
these
themes
within
the
field
and
we
provide
eight
critical
areas
of
future
research
by
illustrating
new
challenges
and
opportunities
we
aim
to
support
the
growth
of
this
area
of
research
within
the
cci
community
in
the
rapidly
evolving
landscape
of
digital
competencies
the
need
for
a
robust
and
universal
method
to
assess
students’
algorithmic_thinking
at

has
become
increasingly
pronounced
algorithmic_thinking
refers
to
the
ability
to
analyse
a
problem
and
develop
a
step-by-step
process
to
solve
it
this
research
investigates
the
efficacy
of
the
cross
array
task
cat
as
an
assessment
tool
for
at
skills
within
switzerland’s
compulsory
education
system
originally
conceptualised
as
an
unplugged
activity
where
students
performed
the
task
without
digital
technologies
eg
by
using
gestures
on
paper
and
an
administrator
manually
assessed
them
the
cat
evolved
into
a
digital
activity
that
runs
on
an
ipad
the
cat’s
digital
transformation
has
automated
the
scoring
of
student
responses
and
data
collection
streamlining
the
assessment
processes
and
facilitating
efficient
large-scale
assessments
it
has
also
enhanced
scalability
making
the
cat
suitable
for
widespread
use
in
educational
settings
furthermore
it
provides
immediate
feedback
to
students
and
educators
supporting
timely
interventions
and
personalised
learning
experiences
our
study
aims
to
comprehensively
investigate
algorithmic
competencies
in
compulsory
education
examining
their
variations
and
influencing
factors
this
research
examines
key
variables
such
as
age
sex
educational
environment
and
school
characteristics
eg
the
level
and
grade
of
education
and
regional
factors
eg
the
canton
of
the
school
in
switzerland
and
characteristics
related
to
the
specific
assessment
tool
including
the
type
of
artefact
used
the
complexity
of
the
algorithms
generated
and
the
level
of
autonomy
additionally
it
seeks
to
analyse
the
effectiveness
of
the
unplugged
and
digital
approaches
in
assessing
at
skills
specifically
comparing
the
unplugged
and
virtual
cat
versions
aiming
to
provide
insights
into
their
advantages
and
potential
synergies
this
investigation
delineates
the
developmental
progression
of
at
skills
across
compulsory
education
emphasising
the
influence
of
age
on
algorithm
development
and
problem-solving
strategies
furthermore
we
reveal
the
impact
of
artefacts
and
the
potential
of
digital
tools
to
facilitate
advanced
at
skill
development
across
diverse
age
groups
finally
our
investigation
delves
into
the
influence
of
school
environments
and
sex
disparities
on
at
performance
alongside
the
significant
individual
variability
influenced
by
personal
abilities
and

a
math
program
based
on
two
original
tangible

for
primary_school
math
and
their
accompanying

we
built
on
prior
work
that
demonstrated
promising
outcomes
regarding
manipulatives
in
math
education
and
tangible

in
a
variety
of
applications
the
owlet
program
was
pilot
tested
in
ten
classrooms
spanning
students
ages
5
to
11
we
found
that
teachers
used
the
exploratory
activities
to
introduce
the
program
and
other
activities
to
encourage
differentiated
student-paced
practice
of
math

our
findings
highlight
the
strengths
and

of
each
tangible

in
the
21st
century
the
academic
field
of
child–computer
interaction
cci
arose
alongside
burgeoning
interactive
technology
and
digital
media
industries
that
targeted
children
we
believe
that
the
field
of
cciu
is
at
an
important
point
in
its
development
analogous
to
when
a
child
becomes
a
teen
over
the
last
few
years
we
have
each
had
many
informal
conversations
with
other
cci
researchers
in
which
we
discuss
issues
such
as
what
is
our
responsibility
as
researchers
beyond
academe
what
values
underlie
our
conceptions
of
a
”good”
childhood
and
the
role
of
interactive
technology
in
it
and
how
do
we
ensure
that
our
field
continues
to
grow
and
evolve
in
ways
that
are
consistent
with
our
responsibilities
and
values
to
address
these
and
other
complex
questions
that
have
been
drawing
our
attention
we
came
together
to
reflect
discuss
and
create
a
position
paper
for
our
community
in
which
we
outline
some
of
the
issues
we
see
facing
our
community
at
this
time
to
inform
our
deliberations
with
opinions
beyond
our
own
we
conducted
an
informal
consultation
with
25
members
of
the
cci
community
our
responders
spanned
junior
to
senior
researchers
represented
diverse
geographies
and
included
industry
practitioners
these
diverse
responses
provided
further
content
for
our
reflections
and
helped
us
see
perspectives
beyond
our
own
the
result
of
this
informal
process
is
this
speculative
paper
in
which
we
propose
a
series
of
seven
provocations
that
aim
to
disrupt
some
of
the
normative
assumptions
held
in
our
field
our
goal
in
doing
this
is
to
open
up
dialogue
in
our
community
about
these
issues
and
promote
consideration
of
the
alternative
visions
we
present
for
where
we
might
focus
our
attention
and
efforts
we
see
our
contribution
not
as
truth
or
a
definitive
statement
of
a
vision
for
the
field
but
rather
as
our
opinion
about
some
of
the
complex
issues
we
face
and
that
we
think
should
be
considered
through
dialogue
as
we
move
into
the
next
phase
of
our
development
as
an
academic
and
scholarly
community
we
believe
that
it
is
urgent
and
critical
for
our
field
that
we
take
up
these
questions
explore
diverse
perspectives
and
critically
work
towards
decisions
and
actions
that
will
define
our
identity
and
the
value
of
our
contributions
as
we
move
forward
into
the
next
20
years
of
research
in
cci
largely
absent
from

this
study
focused
on
how
k-12
art
teachers
in
a
southern
state
used
technology
to
support
teaching
and
learning
uses
they
found
to
be
the
best
and
what
kinds
of
technology
training
they
received
as
part
of
their
initial
teacher
preparation
findings
indicated
that
presentation
and
resource
access
technologies
had
transformed
the
way
art
teachers
in
the
study
work
with
students
and
materials
they
also
had
little
use
of
technology
to
support
students
with
special
needs
and
had
limited
technology
experiences
in
their
own
training
elementary
art
teachers
were
found
to
have
more
examples
of
student
higher-order
thinking
skills
promoting
technology
use
while
secondary
art
teachers
had
more
student

creation
and
a
desire
to
implement

interpretations
are
offered
summary
todays
increased
availability
of
large
amounts
of
human
behavioral

are
contributing
to

growing
reliance
on

to
make
consequential

for
humans
including
those
related
to
access
to

algorithmic
decision-making
processes
might
lead
to
more
objective
decisions
than
those
made
by
humans
who
may
be
influenced
by

conflicts
of

however
algorithmic
decision-making
has
been
criticized
for
its
potential
to
lead
to

in
this

teams
of
researchers
practitioners
policy
makers
and
citizens
to
co-develop
and
evaluate
in
the
real-world
algorithmic
decision-making
processes
designed
to
maximize
fairness
accountability
and
transparency
while
respecting
privacy
the
rapid
advancement
of
artificial
intelligence
ai
has
brought
transformative
changes
to
various
aspects
of
human
life
leading
to
an
exponential
increase
in
the
number
of
ai
users
the
broad
access
and
usage
of
ai
enable
immense
benefits
but
also
give
rise
to
significant
challenges
one
way
for
ai
users
to
address
these
challenges
is
to
develop
ai
literacy
referring
to
human
proficiency
in
different
subject
areas
of
ai
that
enable
purposeful
efficient
and
ethical
usage
of
ai
technologies
this
study
aims
to
comprehensively
understand
and
structure
the
research
on
ai
literacy
for
ai
users
through
a
systematic
scoping
literature
review
therefore
we
synthesize
the
literature
provide
a
conceptual
framework
and
develop
a
research
agenda
our
review
paper
holistically
assesses
the
fragmented
ai
literacy
research
landscape
68
papers
while
critically
examining
its
specificity
to
different
user
groups
and
its
distinction
from
other
technology
literacies
exposing
that
research
efforts
are
partly
not
well
integrated
we
organize
our
findings
in
an
overarching
conceptual
framework
structured
along
the
learning
methods
leading
to
the
components
constituting
and
the
effects
stemming
from
ai
literacy
our
research
agenda
–
oriented
along
the
developed
conceptual
framework
–
sheds
light
on
the
most
promising
research
opportunities
to
prepare
ai
users
for
an
ai-powered
future
of
work
and
society
in
the
last
years
serious
games
have
been
successfully
exploited
in
different
areas
however
in
spite
of
the
powerful
tool
that
this
kind
of
video
games
has
proved
to
be
in
the
classroom
a
few
methodological
efforts
have
been
conducted
in
order
to
involve
pedagogues
or
educators
in
the
design
loop
of
these
games
or
one
step
further
include
students
in
the
co-design
process
to
promote
learning
through
design
as
a
context
with
this
objective
this
paper
presents
a
set
of
metamodels
that
could
facilitate
the
conceptual
design
of
this
type
of
games
to
this
end
a
complete
graphical
notation
based
on
the
uml
standard
with
adaptations
is
defined
for
representing
the
components
of
this
type
of
games
having
in
mind
to
improve
the
collaboration
between
the
team
of
educatorsstudents
and
the
technical
team
during
the
design
process
finally
the
design
diagrams
defined
during
the
production
of
a
specific
serious
game
titled
uranus
are
illustrated
in
order
to
show
the
feasibility
of
the
proposal
in
addition
a
validation
experience
was
conducted
with
educators
and
computer
engineering
students
in
order
to
test
the
value
of
the
proposed
graphic
notation
to
design
educational
games
the
proliferation
of
ai
in
many
aspects
of
human
life—from
personal
leisure
to
collaborative
professional
work
to
global
policy
decisions—poses
a
sharp
question
about
how
to
prepare
people
for
an
interconnected
fast-changing
world
which
is
increasingly
becoming
saturated
with
technological
devices
and
agentic
machines
what
kinds
of
capabilities
do
people
need
in
a
world
infused
with
ai
how
can
we
conceptualise
these
capabilities
how
can
we
help
learners
develop
them
how
can
we
empirically
study
and
assess
their
development
with
this
paper
we
open
the
discussion
by
adopting
a
dialogical
knowledge-making
approach
our
team
of
11
co-authors
participated
in
an
orchestrated
written
discussion
engaging
in
a
semi-independent
and
semi-joint
written
polylogue
we
assembled
a
pool
of
ideas
of
what
these
capabilities
are
and
how
learners
could
be
helped
to
develop
them
simultaneously
we
discussed
conceptual
and
methodological
ideas
that
would
enable
us
to
test
and
refine
our
hypothetical
views
in
synthesising
these
ideas
we
propose
that
there
is
a
need
to
move
beyond
ai-centred
views
of
capabilities
and
consider
the
ecology
of
technology
cognition
social
interaction
and
values

computational
thinking
has
recently
returned
into
the
limelight
as
an
essential
skill
to
have
for
both
the
general
public
and
disciplines
outside
computer
science
it
encapsulates
those
thinking
skills
integral
to
solving
complex
problems
using
a
computer
thus
widely
applicable
in
our
technological
society
several
public
initiatives
such
as
the
hour
of
code
successfully
introduced
it
to
millions
of
people
of
different
ages
and
backgrounds
mostly
using
blocks
programming
environments
like
scratch
that
lower
the
barriers
of
programming
and
facilitate
learning
in
this
paper
we
present
our
arguments
for
fostering
computational
thinking
skills
using
a
blocks
programming
environment
augmented
with
a
tangible
user
interface
namely
by
exploiting
objects
whose
interactions
with
the
physical
environment
are
mapped
to
digital
actions
performed
on
the
system
our
demonstration
includes
a
working
prototype
implementing
our
tangible
blocks
programming
environment
called
tapas
while
in
the
workplace
are
highly
demanded
work-related
awareness
of
computing
and
information
technology
this
discipline
does
not
have
sufficient
and
accurate
dissemination
especially
in
schools
new
technologies
have
positioned
more
as
a
communication
tool
than
as
a
means
for
building
innovative
products
on
the
other
hand
it
has
missed
the
application
of
own
abilities
in
the
area
such
as
the
development
of
logical
reasoning
algorithmic_thinking
and
problem_solving
both
the
school
curriculum
as
well
as
in
instances
of
informal
learning
of
students
in
literature
and
on
the
web
there
are
tools
that
are
accessible
by
both
self-study
students
to
be
used
as
a
complement
to
other
activities
however
these
tools
seek
the
development
of
computational
thinking
itself
and
not
within
a
broader
framework
which
allows
to
present
the
computer
science
as
an
area
of
professional
development
for

ct
gained
significant
importance
in

leading
to
a
surge
in
the
development
of

posed
a
challenge
often
involving
the
introduction

educational
robots
have
been
used
in
schools
for
stem
education
and
for
teaching
students
programming
and
computational

ct
for
many
years
the
look
and
feel
of
traditional
robots
for
educational
purposes
such
as
lego
mindstorms
and
nxt
have
been
mostly
engineering-oriented
not
until
recently
have
robotic
products
such
as
dash
dot
utilized
physical
appearance
which
were
cute
and
kid-friendly
this
study
compared
the
effects
of
using
two
kinds
of
robots-
dash
dot
and
lego
nxt
in
terms
of
students
performance
students
attitudes
about
learning
activities
and
how
different
genders
respond
to
various
robots
a
quasi-experimental
design
was
conducted
the
participants
consisted
of
106
6th
graders
from
four
classes
of
students
two
classes
were
designated
as
the
experimental
groups
which
used

the
other
two

were
the
control
groups
which
used

robots
with
respect
to

the
study
showed
no
significant
difference
between
experimental
and
control
groups
with
respect
to
learning
programming
skills
it
was
found
that
females
in
the
experimental
group
prefer
to
use
robots
females
showed
a
definite
preference
for
using
the
dash
dot
robots
gender
differences
in
computational

ct
among
students
are
obvious
with
boys
‘ct
being
significantly
higher
than

therefore
how
to
effectively
improve

ct
has
become
a
serious
concern
this
study
integrated
two
types
of
project-based_learning
pbl
into
a
scratch
programming
course
one
with
extensive
teacher-supported
scaffolding
and
the
other
with
limited
teacher-supported
scaffolding
to
examine
their
impact
on

ct
skills
and
self-efficacy
this
study
applied
mixed
research
methods
conducted
a
pretest-posttest
control
group
experiment
and
analyzed
the
quantitative
and
qualitative
data
collected
from
21
grade-3
girls
in
a
primary_school
it
was
found
that
the
extensive
teacher-supported
scaffolding
of
pbl
in
a
scratch
programming
course
is
more
effective
in
promoting
the
ct
skills
and

than
limited
teacher-supported
scaffolding
of

these
findings
have
some
implications

we
describe
the
early

of
a
project
aiming
to
reform
the
cfp
curriculum
such
that
ct
skills
becomes
an
integral

as
a
first
step
we
carried-out
four
introductory
workshops
with
64
first-and
third-semester
cfp

and
then
surveyed
them
to
gather
their
perceptions
on

the
results
show
that
the
students
have
a
limited
understanding
of
ct
and
its
associated
skills
but
they
recognize
their
importance
moreover
they
agree
that
primary_school
should
be
the
starting
point
to
develop

the
project
will
continue
gathering
information
from
current

one
of
the
challenges
of

ct
is
implicit
within
the
current
high_school
curriculum
and
used
by
teachers
and
students
every
day
in
their
classrooms
across
multiple
content
areas
most
students
are
unaware
they
are
using
these
skills
and
that
these
skills
are
the
foundation
of
learning
computer
science
over
a
series
of
workshops
high_school
teachers
and
students
and
university
faculty
discussed
the
need
to
incorporate
ct
skills
throughout
the
high_school
curriculum
to
improve
those
skills
in
students
and
to
impart
a
better
understanding
of
computer

the
result
was
a
guide
created
to
assist
high_school
teachers
to
make
ct
concepts
explicit
in
their
classes
a
main
component
of
the
guide
includes
specific
examples
of
how
to
incorporate
ct
skills
in
various
content
areas
the
guide
was
created
on
a
foundation
of
cultural
relevance
and
cogenerative
dialogues
here
we
describe
salient
points
about
the
creation
of
the
guide
and
insights
gained
during
these
workshops
the
objective
of
this
work
is
focused
on
the
definition
of
a
methodology
for
the
development
of
computational
thinking
and
the
subsequent
measurement
of
the
development
obtained
in
the
students
the
methodological
proposal
includes
specific
tasks
or
activities
to
develop
computational
thinking
as
well
as
tests
that
allow
analyzing
the
extent
to
which
computational
thinking
or
skills
related
to
problem_solving
have
been
developed
in
a
scientific
specific
or
even
general
or
of
practical
application
in
situations
of
daily
life
once
the
methodological
framework
was
defined
we
proceeded
to
develop
a
computer
tool
that
provides
global
support
for
the
implementation
of
this
methodology
the
implemented
platform
has
a
simple
and
intuitive
design
that
allows
an
easy
use
of
it
since
it
is
aimed
at
pre-university
students
and
teachers
who
necessarily
do
not
have
advanced
knowledge
of
computer
science
finally
the
platform
automatically
provides
progress
reports
and
course
development
including
statistical
data
by
age
or
gender
among
others
technologies
for
development
have
great
potential
in
accelerating
the
socio-economic
progress
of
disadvantaged
communities
but
these
technologies
are
usually
developed
by
people
removed
from
the
daily
realities
of
fieldwork
this
paper
explores
the
need
and
the
possibilities
of
educating
rural
populations
and
social
workers
on
the
use
of
technology
to
create
their
own
digital
artifacts
we
discuss
two
workshops
one
for
villagers
in
the
state
of
telangana
and
the
second
one
for
graduate
students
of
a
university
social
work
department
exploring
the
use
of
mits
scratch
software
as
a
tool
for
assisting
in
social
interventions
we
also
discuss
the
results
of
an
acceptability
study
among
the
social
work
students
to
gauge
the
potential
for
such
a
tool
to
be
used
in
the
field
computational
thinking
assessment
is
an
important
part
of
testing
the
effectiveness
of
computational
thinking
cultivation
however
the
existing
computational
thinking
assessments
still
suffer
from
the
problem
of
insufficient
examination
of
non-cognitive
factors
leading
to
the
lack
of
validity
of
its
assessment
results
since
the
iceberg
model
can
comprehensively
and
deeply
explore
individual
characteristics
this
paper
draws
on
the
division
idea
of
the
model
and
divides
computational
thinking
into
explicit
computational
thinking
the
basic
knowledge
required
to
solve
problems
using
computational
thinking
and
implicit
computational
thinking
the
internal
psychological
characteristics
of
individuals
in
the
process
of
using
computational
thinking
a
comprehensive
assessment
framework
of
computational
thinking
is
constructed
which
contains
five
dimensions
knowledge
and
skills
self-efficacy
internet
attitude
learning
motivation
and
thinking
style
finally
its
application
in
the
hierarchical
teaching
of
computational
thinking
and
suggestions
for
personalized
teaching
programs
are
given
in
order
to
promote
the
development
of
personalized
education
in
computational
thinking
computational
thinking
ct
is
a
fundamental
skill
that
is
not
only
confined
to
computer
scientists’
activities
but
can
be
widely
applied
in
daily
life
and
is
required
in
order
to
adapt
to
the
future
and
therefore
should
be
taught
at
early
ages
within
this
framework
assessing
ct
is
an
indispensable
part
to
consider
in
order
to
introduce
ct
in
the
school
curricula
nevertheless
efforts
involving
the
formal
assessment
of
computational

has
primarily
focused
on
middle
school
grades
and
above
and
are
mostly
based
on
the
analysis
of

been
designed
including
several

submitted
to
a

and
administered
to

the
bctt

is
considered
adequate
by

and
results
show
a
high
reliability
for
the
assessment
of

particularly
in

this

mainly
adopts
the
theory
with

combines
the
computational

method
with
education
and

and
constructs
the

the

which
simplifies
the

process
of

thinking
and
enhances
students

studies
have
shown
that
learning
approaches
are
able
to
promote
the
developments
of
computational

on
students
including
cooperative_learning
project-based_learning
online

etc
therefore
these
learning
approaches
can
combine
with
the
traditional
teaching
in
a
more
effective
way
blended

may
promote
the
developments
of
computational

on

the
paper
takes
the
junior
college
students
as
the
experimental
objects
and
carries
a
pretest-posttest
study
through
unequal
experimental
and
control
groups
it
approved
that
blended
learning
has
a
positive
impact
on
the
college
students
computational
thinking
ie
they
have
an
obvious
progress
an
algorithm
is
a
set
of
rules
for
getting
a
specific
output
from
a
specific
input
each
step
must
be
so
precisely
defined
that
it
can
be
translated
into
computer
language
and
executed
by
machine
my
basic
idea
is
that
programming
is
the
most
powerful
medium
of
developing
the
sophisticated
and
rigorous
thinking
needed
for
mathematics
for
grammar
for
physics
for
statistics
and
all
the
“hard”
subjects
maybe
i
would
even
include
philosophy
and
historical
analysis
in
short
i
believe
more
than
ever
that
programming
should
be
a
key
part
of
the
intellectual
development
of
people
growing
up
computational
thinking
is
an
essential
skill
for
all
students
in
the
21st

a
fundamental
question
is
how
can
we
create
computer
affordances
to
empower
novice
teachers
and
students
in
a
variety
of
stem
and
art
disciplines
to
think
computationally
while
avoiding
difficult
overhead
emerging
from
traditional
coding
over
the
last
20
years
we
have
iteratively
developed
tools
that
aim
to
support
computational
thinking
as
these
tools
evolved
a
philosophy
emerged
to
support
computational
thinking
by
joining
human
abilities
with
computer
affordances
chief
among
these
findings
is
that
supporting
computational

is
much
more
than
making
coding

the
national
consensus
on
the
significance
of
computational
thinking
has
prompted
the
expansion
of
related
educational
initiatives
over
the
past
decade
since
the
definition
of
computational
thinking
by
wing
in
2006
this
concept
has
gained
significant
attention
within
the
educational
community
particularly
this
surge
of
interest
has
led
to
extensive
research
into
its
conceptual
foundations
and
subsequent
integration
into
educational
curricula
since
2013
national
initiatives
have
since
emerged
to
incorporate
computational
thinking
into
the
educational
system
furthermore
as
artificial
intelligence
and
computing
systems
become
increasingly
integrated
into
daily
life
there
is
a
growing
demand
from
industries
for
a
workforce
and
graduates
adept
at
critical_thinking
and
problem-solving
aligned
with
this
national
movement
our
study
presents
a
two-year
institutional
initiative
aimed
at
integrating
computational
thinking
into
the
software
engineering
program
the
software
engineering
discipline
extensively
involves
design
thinking
and
problem-solving
skills
however
we
noticed
that
these
higher-level
skills
are
not
imparted
early
in
the
program
to
teach
students
this
method
of
thinking
and
approaching
problems
to
bridge
this
skill
gap
we
developed
a
set
of
computational
thinking
modules
and
integrated
them
into
a
gateway
course
in
the
software
engineering
program
over
two
years
we
implemented
this
intervention
in
an
introductory-level
course
and
evaluated
its
impact
on
students
computational
thinking
skills
by
analyzing
their
responses
to
a
standard
computational
thinking
assessment
survey
the
results
showed
significant
improvement
in
most
components
these
early
findings
underscore
the
effectiveness
of
integrating
these
computational
thinking
modules
into
the
gateway
courses
regardless
of
the
specific
course
topic
a
notable
feature
of
these
modules
is
their
adaptability
to
diverse
engineering
courses
suggesting
broader

moving
forward
our
research
aims
to
expand
the
integration
of
the
computational

across
the
nation
and
analyze
their
impact
on

of
16
teachers
at

indonesia
they
represented
a
variety
of

experiences
the
survey
took
place
after
the
respondents
received
a
short
training
about
stem
and
computational

quantitative
analysis
showed
that
most
elementary_school
teachers
positively
demonstrated
computational
thinking
practices
in
their
schools
besides
they
believed
that
computational
thinking
could
help
students
think
logically
structurally
and
creatively
while
stem
helped
train
students
to
be
problem
solvers
in
an
analytical
critical
and
practical
way
in
addition
most

intended
to
continue
learning

approaches
in

added
to
this
the

also
improved
based
on
the
results
of
the

physiological

is
becoming
increasingly
popular
as

improves
however
little
is
known
regarding
potential
connections
between
hands-on
experience
with
physiological

perspectives
this
is
particularly
true
for
black

applications
for
physiological

include
systems
such
as
wearable

the

presents
our

in

we
share
our

of
computational

that
emerged
while
black

the

can
develop

because
of
these

and
develop

so
these

could
be
effectively
used

a
significant
aspect
of
computational
thinking
is
as
a
way
of
reasoning
about
the
world
in

of

this
mindset
channels
number-crunching
toward
an
ambition
to
discover

through

students
correctly
identified
different

but
perceived
‘computation’
as
a
distressing
anxiety-eliciting
task
framed
with

and
lacking

students
mindsets
around
‘data’
‘model’
and
‘simulations’
critically
revealed
no
awareness
of
numerical

our
findings
provide
evidence
of
a
crippled
computational

mindset
in
students
who
acquire
mathematical
skills
that
are
not
channelled
toward
real-world
discovery
through

this
unlinked
knowledge
ends
up
being
perceived
as
distressing
number-crunching
expertise
with
no
relevant
outcome
the
virtuous
mindset
of

reported
here
indicates
that
computational

can
be
restored
by
training
students
specifically
in
coding
modelling
and

in
relation
to
discovering

our
approach
opens
innovative
ways
for
quantifying
computational

and
enhancing

most

this

provides
evidence
of
the
effectiveness
of

to
develop
computational

in
high_school

in

by
applying

after
a
voluntary

the
results
reveal
a
significant
improvement
in
computational

after
the
workshop
however
we
observe
that
there
was
a
tendency
to
drop
out
of
the
workshop
among
students
with
lower
levels
of
initial
computational

besides
tenth-grade
students
obtained
lower
final
scores

these
results
indicate
that
teaching
a
low-level

is
useful
but
it
has
high
entry-barriers
building

this
paper
introduces
the
notion
of
predicting
academic
performance
based
on
computational
thinking
the
integral
role
that
computational
thinking
modalities
play
in
engineering
disciplines
can
serve
as
an
accurate
indicator
of
the
student
future
academic
success
therefore
this
study
investigated
the
students
performance
in
a
computational
thinking
course
offered
at
the
freshman
level
to
predict
student
academic
success
to
achieve
this
goal
a
two-year
study
of
the
correlation
between
the
students
accumulative
grade

was
conducted
the
performance
of
nine
hundred

eighty
two
students
in
forty
sections
was
assessed
over
the
two-year
period
it
was
concluded
that
the
students
future
academic
performance
is
strongly
correlated
to
their
computational
thinking
skills
assessed
at
the
freshman
level
this
clearly
suggests
the
viability
of
using
computational
thinking
skills
as
a
fairly
accurate
predictor
of
students
academic
success
these
results
have
also
implied
that
the
assessment
of
computational

can
be
used
as
an
early

the
promotion
of
computational

education
has
become
a
worldwide
trend
to
cultivate
the
computational

ability
of
children
at

between
two

and
computational
problem-solving
practices
in
acquiring
related
computational

practices
during
a
first-year
undergraduate
engineering
course
while
computational

theory
is
still
developing
empirical
studies
can
help
further
understand
how

therefore
with
this
empirical

the
following
questions
are
addressed

what
are
the
differences
in

how
do
these

correspond
to
the

the
use
of
a
descriptive

supports
the
characterization
of

demonstrating
differences
in
their

at
the

from
these
four

two
of
them
show
a
subsequent
differential

appear
as
a

these
findings
suggest
that
previous
knowledge
or
exposure
to
different

can
result
in
different
progressions
of

emphasizing
the
relevance
of

the

of
an

programming
has
become
a
crucial

in
today’s

technology
and
computers
are
basically
part
of
anything
now
president
obama
once
referred
to
the
importance
of
children
learning
programming
“i
do
not
want
our
young
people
to
just
be
consumers
i
want
them
to
be
producers
of
this
technology
and
to
understand
it
to
feel
like
they
are
controlling
it
as
opposed
to
it
controlling
them”
it
is
thus
an
increasing
need
for
an
individual
to
know
how
to
write
their
own
programs
with
the
increasing
dependency
on
computation
one
can
anticipate
such
skills
being
a
requirement
for
most
jobs
in
the
coming
years
there
is
a
lot
of
effort
done
in
this
area
however
most
of

focused
on
either
software
or

track
the
aim
of
this
work
is
to
test
if
using
a
hybrid
approach
for
teaching
k-12
students
programming
by
combining
both
software
and
hardware
techniques
is
more
effective
than
using
a
singleton
approach
computational
models
and
simulations
can
be
powerful
tools
to
help
learners
understand
a
wide
variety
of
natural
phenomena
however
understanding
and
learning
from
computational
models
requires
learners
to
comprehend
the
rules
agents
follow
that
lead
to
emergent
outcomes
blocks-based
programming
is
useful
in
scaffolding
learners
in
the
early
stage
of
programming
tasks
we
posit
that
students
can
authentically
interact
with
agent-based
modeling
via
a
blocks-based
dialect
of
the
popular
abm
language
netlogo
dubbed
nettango
across
many
difficulty
levels
specifically
we
discuss
three
different
activities
in
which
we
have
integrated
blocks-based
programming

that
show
blocks
can
be
used
for
activities

increasing

computational
thinking
has
become
a
required
capability
in
the
student
learning
process
and
digital
games
as
a
teaching
approach
have
presented
promising
educational
results
in
the
development
of
this
competence
however
properly
evaluating
the
effectiveness
and
consequently
student
progress
in
a
course
using
games
is
still
a
challenge
one
of
the
most
widely
implemented
ways
of
evaluation
is
with
an
automated
analysis
of
the
code
developed
in
the
classes
during
the
construction
of
digital
games
nevertheless
this
topic
has
not
yet
been
explored
in
aspects
such
as
incremental

the
model
and
teaching
environment
and
the
influences
of
acquiring
skills
and
competencies
of
computational

motivated
by
this
knowledge
gap
this
paper
introduces
a
framework
proposal
to
analyze
the
evolution
of
computational
thinking
skills
in
digital
games
classes
the
framework
is
based
on
a
data
mining
technique
that
aims
to
facilitate
the
discovery
process
of
the
patterns
and
behaviors
that
lead
to
the
acquisition
of
computational
thinking
skills
by
analyzing
clusters
with
an
unsupervised
neural
network
of
self-organizing
maps
som
for
this
purpose
the
framework
is
composed
of
a
collection
of
processes
and
practices
structured
in
data
collection
data
preprocessing
data
analysis
and
data
visualization
a
case
study
using
scratch
was
executed
to
validate
this
approach
the
results
point
to
the
viability
of
the
framework
highlighting
the
use
of
the
visual
exploratory
data
analysis
through
the
som
maps
as
an
efficient
tool
to
observe
the
acquisition
of
computational

skills
by
the
student
in
an
incremental
course
this
document
presents
the
results
of
the
development
of
a
learning
program
on
computational
thinking
through
programming
challenges
with
robots
oriented
to
early
childhood
the
methodological
approach
used
was
quantitative
using
a
quasi-experimental
design
taking
pretestposttest
measures
with
experimental
and
control
groups
the
sample
of
participating
students
was
46
they
belonged
to
a
group
of
first
grade
of
primary_education
aged
between
6
and
7
years
in
a
spanish
educational
center
the
learning
of
computational
thinking
was
measured
through
the
following
dimensions
algorithmic_thinking-sequences
abstraction-patterns
and
debugging
the
learning
activities
used
were
an
adaptation
of
the
activities
proposed
in
the
“tangiblek”
robotics
curriculum
the
results
generated
show
positive
effects
in
relation
to
the
level
of
achievement
reached
by
the
students
in
the
proposed
challenges
in
other
words
there
is
a
significant
effect
on
the
mastery
of
skills
related
to
computational
thinking
differences
were
found
between
the
pretest
and
posttest
measures
of
the
experimental
group
those
of
the
latter
group
were
statistically
significant
and
higher
than
those
of
the
control
group
therefore
we
can
statistically
attribute
the
mastery
of
computational
thinking
skills
to
the
participation
in
the
training
activities
computational
thinking
is
irrefutably
a
must-have
skill
in
todays
digital
world
this
is
why
it
is
a
requisite
course
in
most
college
curricula
computational
thinking
is
a
broad
term
encompassing
fundamental
concepts
of
computing
such
as
formulating
problems
and
expressing
their
solutions
in
computational
steps
that
can
be
processed
by
a
computer
the
ability
to
organize
and
analyze
data
is
also
a
part
of
computational
thinking
following
this
paradigm
educational
institutions
have
adopted
various
methods
to
teach
computational
thinking
including
programming
this
paper
will
explore
a
specific
project
within
the
computational
thinking
course
taught
as
an
introductory
course
in
all
major
programs
at
the
higher
colleges
of
technology
in
the
united
arab
emirates
the
intention
of
the
paper
is
to
demonstrate
how
a
project-based
data
analytics
assessment
in
such
a
course
can
be
used
to
foster
in
students
a
greater
awareness
of
a
contemporary
and
critical
global
issue
such
as
waste
management
to
examine
the
effectiveness
of
this
project
the
paper
documents
and
evaluates
the
work
of
a
group
of
students
who
carried
out
data
analysis
on
secondary
data
collected
from
a
notable
website
on
“waste
management”
the
methodology
implemented
for
this
task
is
developed
based
on
a
prescribed
course
syllabus
and
assessment
structure
which
promotes
student-centered
and
inter-disciplinary
learning
the
development
of
computational
thinking
as
a
cognitive
skill
is
crucial
in
the
digital
age
however
there
remains
no
consensus
on
its
definition
or
measurement
this
study
aims
to
address
this
gap
by
developing
an
instrument
to
estimate
the
level
of
computational
thinking
using
an
evidence-centered
design
approach
the
proposed
framework
integrates
cognitive
theory
educational
research
and
psychometric
modeling
to
create
a
comprehensive
and
reliable
assessment
tool
the
instrument
consists
of
two
scenarios
with
a
total
of
59
items
divided
into
six
questions
it
was
validated
by
experts
in
the
field
achieving
a
content
validity
index
of
076
the
test
was
administered
to
a
sample
of
100
students
from
three
secondary
schools
in
lima
peru
and
analyzed
using
bayesian
confirmatory_factor_analysis
and
parametric
tests
the
results
indicate
that
the
model
effectively
assesses
algorithmic_thinking
critical_thinking
and
problem_solving
skills
regardless
of
prior
programming
experience
however
the
assessment
of
creativity
requires
further
refinement
this
research
contributes
to
evidence-based
educational
policy
and
practice
in
secondary_education
offering
a
foundation
for
future
improvements
in
the
evaluation
of
computational
thinking
design
thinking
is
considered
as
a
creative
humancentred
participative
exploratory
and
problem-solving
process
that
values
different
perspectives
of
a
problem
in
this
study
we
bring
the
design
thinking
in
a
curriculum
framework
of

which
is
currently
popular
block
based

are
investigated
in
order
to
understand
perceptions
of
app

and
physics
cognitive

involved
in
the
game

the
future
work
is
to
construct
a

pattern
recognition
is
one
of
the
fundamental
competencies
associated
with
computational
thinking
and
stem
education
although
much
has
been
written
to
define
computational
thinking
ct
we
argue
that
ct
is
a
multi-faceted
construct
and
specific
aspects
of
ct
such
as
pattern
recognition
should
be
examined
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
conduct
a
systematic
review
of
literature
on
pattern
recognition
to
define
pattern
recognition
as
an
aspect
of
computational
thinking
the
synthesis
included
the
engineering
village
database
compendex
and
inspec
we
searched
peer
reviewed
articles
and
the
keywords
pattern
recognition
pattern
generalization
and
education
the
initial
search
resulted
in
208
articles
the
screening
of
abstracts
more
closely
resulted
in
17
relevant
articles
which
were
then
read
in
detail
by
two
researchers
the
review
of
this
pool
resulted
in
two
relevant
articles
one
with
a
focus
on
mathematics
education
and
the
other
one
in
the
context
of
medical
education
surprisingly
there
were
no
articles
that
examined
pattern
recognition
as
part
of
engineering
or
computer
education
further
research
examining
specific
aspects
of
ct
is
necessary
this
work
is
the
result
of
an
investigation
carried
out
within
the
framework
of
a
research
grant
the
work
experience
that
this
team
carried
out
was
aimed
at
describing
and
systematizing
the
configuration
of
computational
thinking
its
incidence
and
validity
in
the
educational
field
from
the
analysis
of
public
policies
from
an
interdisciplinary
approach
the
experience
carried
out
was
developed
based
on
a
bibliographic
and
documentary
analysis
work
which
allowed
recovering
the
concept
of
computational
thinking
to
analyze
it
in
conjunction
with
the
development
of
critical
pedagogical
practice
and
the
concept
of
competences
here
an
analysis
of
some
of
the
current
debates
presented
by
computational
thinking
and
its
teaching
is
presented
in
order
to
promote
a
line
of
dialogue
and
problematization
between
what
was
done
is
done
and
is
projected
on
this
subject

computer

struggle
to
agree
on
a
definition
of
their
discipline
and
perhaps
the
only
term
common
term
to
all
existing

is
that
of

this

reports
on
an
investigation
into

aimed
to
promote
the
computer

discipline
by
providing
skills
and
resources
necessary
to
teach

the
results
of
our
investigation
indicate
that
digital

teachers
in
our
sample

had
one
common
misconception
about
the

we
also
found
that
the

was
changed
after
3
days
of

the

a
key
challenge
educational
game
developers
face
in
creating
rich
interactive
learning
experiences
that
integrate
computational

is
the
lack
of
an
embeddable
block-based

toolkit
current
block-based
programming
languages
such
as
blockly
and
scratch
cannot
be
easily
embedded
into
industry-standard
3d
game
engines
this
paper
presents
intelliblox
a
blockly-inspired
toolkit
for
the
unity
cross-platform
game
engine
that
enables
learners
to
create
block-based

environments
our
experience
using
intelliblox
suggests
that
it
is
an
effective
toolkit
for
integrating
block-based
programming
challenges
into
game-based_learning
environments
in
this

we
combined

when
prompted
using

the
popularization
of
digital
educational
devices
with
low

has
encouraged
the
development
of
many
training
activities
oriented
towards
the
incorporation
of
technology
in
schools
in
some
cases
the
introduction
of

has
led
to
the
development
of
new
educational
practices
that
support
the
development
of
computational
thinking
however
the
supposed
benefits
of
these
approaches
have
not
been
properly
assessed
moreover
having
taught
over
30
workshops
with
the
scratch
programming
tool
to
teachers
at
different
educational
levels
primary
secondary
university
we
found
no
evidence
of
subsequent
methodological
changes
in

this
study
tries
to
understand
the
dissonance
between
the
alleged
success
of
initiatives
around
digital
literacy
and
the
lack
of
continuity
in
the
use
of
user-friendly
programming
environments
like
scratch
for
this
purpose
we
analyzed
the
evolution
of
the
grades
of
scratch
programming
achieved
by
the
students
of
the
school
of

of
vitoria-gasteiz
and
their
engagement
with

we
also
interviewed
teachers
from
different
schools
who
have
participated
in
scratch
workshops
with
us
after
this
study
we
identified
some
of
the
circumstances
that
facilitate
and
hinder
the
development
of
computational
thinking
since
we
consider
scratch
as
a
resource
that
allows
the
development
of
new
methodological
approaches
in
the
classroom
as
well
as
the
acquisition
of
skills
related
to
computational
thinking
we
propose
a
framework
that
will
help
to
overcome
the
current
status
fundamentals
of
computer
is
a
compulsory
course
of
non-majors
in
many
universities
of
china
in
this
paper
we
explore
the
reform
on
this
course
for
two
goals
one
is
to
redesign
the
teaching
content
from
operation
oriented
to
computational
thinking
oriented
computational
thinking
is
one
of
the
most
important
ability
for
21st
century
and
has
become
the
primary
goal
of
computer
foundation
education
new
content
covers
the
basic
principles
of
computer
science
as
well
as
the
fundamental
ways
of
thinking
and
problem_solving
with
computer
the
second
goal
is
to
improve
teaching
methods
by
leveraging
mobile
technology
we
propose
the
use
of
mit
app
inventor
which
is
a
simple
tool
for
creating
mobile
applications
for
android
students
with
no
prior
knowledge
of
programming
can
create
entertaining
and
socially
useful
applications
with
app
inventor
while
practicing
computational
thinking
software
engineering
is
the
part
of
computer
science
that
is
too
difficult
for
the
computer
scientist
with
the
introduction
of
distance
learning
during
the
lockdown
teachers
faced
a
number
of
problems
on
how
to
implement
the
teaching
educational
robotics
was
particularly
negatively
affected
by
this
period
in
our
country
educational
robotics
is
usually
taught
in
informatics
classes
however
in
many
schools
the
teaching
of
informatics
during
the
lockdown
was
very
limited
and
often
focused
only
on
basic
digital
skills
as
a
similar
situation
occurred
in
several
european
countries
the
idea
of
supporting
teachers
in
such
cases
was
proposed
within
an
international
project
we
are
involved
in
a
methodology
is
being
designed
to
develop
computational
thinking
in
students
at
all
school
levels
through
educational
robotics
in
combination
with
a
school
arts
subject
the
methodology
is
based
on
the
idea
of
project-based_learning
and
should
use
blended
learning
methods
in
this
paper
we
describe
the
planning
and
the
course
of
an
educational
activity
–
a
project
–
using
the
currently
developed
methodology
the
results
presented
are
from
its
pilot
validation
with
lower-secondary
students
without
previous
experience
with
robotics
the
project
combined
the
theme
of
greek
myths
with
robotics
using
lego
spike
prime
during
the
validation
we
focused
primarily
on
students’
work
with
basic
programming
concepts
our
research
problem
was
to
validate
the
quality
and
potential
of
the
proposed
methodology
and
the
computational
thinking
skills
it
can
develop
the
paper
concludes
with
recommendations
for
further
development
of
the
methodology
and
also
for
the
use
of
the
selected
robotic
kit
with
respect
to
programming
in
informatics
classes
although
there
have
been
many
advances
in
end-user
programming
environments
recent
empirical
studies
report
that
programming
still
remains
difficult
for
end-users
we
hypothesize
that
one
reason
may
be
lack
of
effective
support
for
helping
end-user
programmers
problem-solve
their
own
way
around
barriers
they
encounter
therefore
in
this
paper
we
describe
the
idea
garden
a
concept
designed
to
help
end-user
programmers
generate
new
ideas
and
problem-solve
when
they
run
into
barriers
the
idea
garden
has
its
roots
in
minimalist
learning
theory
and
problem-solving
theories
our
proof-of-concept
prototype
of
the
idea
garden
concept
in
the
coscripter
end-user
programming
environment
currently
targets
three
barriers
reported
in
end-user
programming
literature
it
does
so
using
an
integrated
just-in-time
combination
of
scaffolding
for
problem-solving
strategies
for
design
patterns
and
for
programming
concepts
our
empirical
results
showed
that
this
approach
helped
end-user
programmers
overcome
all
three
types
of
barriers
that
our
prototype
targeted
in
order
to
engage
the
player
video
games
are
often
based
on
challenges
that
must
be
overcome
what
are
colloquially
known
as
programming
games
present
these
challenges
as
puzzles
where
computational
thinking
and
coding
skills
have
a
fundamental
role
in
successfully
overcoming
them
even
though
they
are
not
serious
games
and
have
been
designed
purely
as
entertainment
products
indeed
algorithm
design
and
coding
is
the
fun
part
this
paper
presents
a
survey
of
all
such
games
up
to
february
2020
published
in
the
steam
digital
distribution
platform
categorizing
them
by
content
covered
according
to
a
basic
programming
curriculum
this
study
provides
some
insights
on
the
nature
of
this
kind
of
games
and
allows
assessing
their
adequacy
as
educational
tools
broadening
the
body
of
knowledge
on
available
games
for
teaching
computational

and
coding
beyond
serious
games
engaging
youngsters
with
ancient
approaches
in

especially
reading
grows
ever
tougher
in
the
face
of
their
attachment
to

in
this
paper
we
explore
the
digital

more
interesting
and
memorable
for

digital

is
recognized
as
a
motivating
instructional
approach
that
engages
learners
in
21st
century
learning
skills
which
will
be
essential
to
success
in
the
future
digital

is
one
of
the
latest
pedagogical
approaches
that
can
engage

educators
are
in

of
recent

and
education
approaches
to
engage

using
mit

have
the
potential
to
meet
this
demand
in
this

we
propose
an
ar
augmented
reality-based
virtual
educational
robotics
learning
system
called
in
recent
years
with
the
rise
of
the
concept
of
computational

the
issue
about
college
computer
teaching
reforms
has
received
wide
attention
a
high
percentage
of
the
research
nowadays
focuses
on
how
to
impart
knowledge
of
computer
in
the
perspective
of
computational
thinking
but
more
importantly
the
research
ignores
an
important
way
to
train
thinking
-
practice
this
paper
starts
with
the
“college
computer
curriculum”
which
is
the
first
computer
course
for
undergraduate
students
by
using
virtual
reality
technology
this
paper
gives
the
college
teacher
an
experimental
design
method
of
“college

some
exploratory
research
works
have
been
performed
to
explain
how
to
embody
the
basic
problems
of
computer
public
course
finally
we
introduce
a
set
of
virtual
experiment
libraries
which
are
independent
research
and
development
these
experiments
have
already
achieved
excellent
results
in
the
practical
teaching
of
college
computer

more
and
more
colleges
have
offered
introductory
programming
courses
for
students
from
different
majors
aiming
to
cultivate
students
computational
thinking
skills
however
teaching
introductory
programming
courses
especially
to
freshmen
remains
a
challenging
endeavor
despite
a
lot
of
research
and
experiments
in
this
paper
we
presented
our
innovative
teaching
strategy
and
its
implementation
both
with
the
utilization
of
visualization
in
an
introductory
python
programming
course
the
results
from
our
comparative
teaching
experiments
show
that
visualization
could
benefit
students
a
lot
in
learning
python
programming
and
improving
their
computational
thinking
abilities
computational
thinking
is
considered
critical
for
learning
to
code
in
k-12
education
standards
the
logic-first
syntax-later
argument
has
been
instrumental
in
promoting
block-based
languages
such
as
snap
and
scratch
with
limited
success
in
contrast
we
believe
that
expressing
the
logic
of
computational
problems
in
the
student’s
language
is
more
convenient
and
natural
in
such
an
environment
learners
will
experience
the
least
impedance
mismatch
between
their
conceptual
view
and
the
target
code
they
write
in
this
paper
a
new
natural
language-based
programming
system
called
trypl
try
programming
in
logic
is
introduced
and
discussed
we
demonstrate
that
trypl
helps
to
identify
gaps
in
logic
and
assists
in
validating
learners’
mental
models
of
abstract
algorithms
an
argument
is
also
made
as
to
why
using
a
natural
language-based
programming
environment
and
a
learning
model
to
teach
computational
thinking
could
be
more
effective

one
erroneous
idea
from
peruvian
population
is
to
think
that
for
teaching
technology
concepts
in
public
schools
is
very
important
the
use
of
hardware
software
electricity
or
internet
the
truth
is
that
exists
lots
of
teaching
methods
for
developing
a
computational
thinking
and
these
do
not
depend
on
the
resources
mentioned
before
children
have
demonstrated
a
big
capacity
for
secure
their
knowledge
if
the
teaching
method
is
simple
and
didactic
through
games
and
recreational
activities
for
these
reasons
we
propose
the
use
of
unplugged_activities
which
do
not
require
the
use
of
computers
and
has
the
objective
of
promoting
clearing
out
and
developing
essentials
concepts
of
computer
science
as
well
as
developing
the
computational
thinking
in
kids
through
a
funny
and
dynamic
focus
in
this
way
they
are
going
to
be
prepared
to
enter
in
a
world
where
the
computer
science
is
expanding
progressively
in
each
area
of

this
work
in

explores
the
landscape
of
computing

resources
and
environments
found
on
the

together
with
teaching
and
learning
materials
that
can
facilitate
the
integration
of

into
the

this
paper
focuses
in
finding
and
describing
existing

environments
that
integrate
computational

into
a
stem
discipline
together
with
lesson
plans

and
other

the
application
of
“programming
education”
has
become
one
of
the
future
technological
trends
and
students
with

backgrounds
should
also
grasp
this
important
development
in
this

the
“agilepoint

was
established
and

and
there
are
no

entails
also
as
the

rather
new
the

the

from
a
variety
of

sources
which
reveal
connections
between

specifically
the
concept

the
various
aspects

about
the
case
initially
developed
with
a
focus
on
print
manuals
and
online
help
the
course
began
teaching
topic-based
authoring
in
the
mid-2000s
however
most
enterprise-level
editors
and
tools
were
cost-prohibitive
for
students
and
faculty
furthermore
many
computing
concepts
associated
with
structured
authoring
were
intimidating
for
an
audience
of
students
in
an
english
department
an
affordable
solution
was
adopting
the
open-source
dita
standard
using
free
trials
or
open-source
editors
the
intimidation
factor
was
minimized
by
designing
the
course
around
five
layers
of
abstraction
that
draw
on
students
previous
rhetorical
knowledge
layer
1
developing

discusses
each
layer
of
abstraction
the
associated
assignments
for
each
layer
and
the
results
of
each
layer
based
on
student
feedback
results
and
conclusions
although
the
course
is
not
universally
loved
by
students
it
has
seen
many
successes
and
provides
a
much-needed
foundation
in
component
content
management
and
structured
authoring
for
students
who
might
become
technical
communicators
the
teaching
team
has
learned
to
avoid
overemphasizing
coding
and
automation
in
structured
authoring
maintain
a
solid
grounding
on
writing
principles
and
good
technical
communication
requirements
and
draw
upon
students
existing
knowledge
of
genres
and
their
constraints
several
instruments
have
been
used
for
assessing
computational
thinking
ct
abilities
in
this
exploratory
and
preliminary
study
we
investigate
how
appropriate
the
bebras
challenge
is
as
an
instrument
to
assess
and
measure
ct
abilities
bebras
is
an
international
challenge
whose
goal
is
to
promote
computer
science
and
ct
the
test
can
be
answered
without
any
prior
knowledge
on
computer
science
our
broad
research
question
is
whether
we
can
evolve
bebras
into
a
full
fledged
instrument
to
assess
and
measure
ct
abilities
in
this
paper
we
instantiate
a
few
more
specific
research
questions
is
bebras
performance
a
good
predictor
of
success
for
students
within
programming
courses
is
there
any
correlation
between
bebras
performance
and
students
grades
do
students
improve
their
performance
in
bebras
tests
when
exposed
to
the
contents
of
a
programming
course
our
dataset
consists
of
the
grades
of
138
students
who
attended
introductory
programming
courses
at
two
brazilian
universities
and
their
performance
in
two
simulated
bebras
tests
the
first
test
was
applied
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
and
therefore
before
any
exposition
to
programming
classes
the
second
one
was
applied
at
the
end
of
the
term
the
results
suggest
that
the
performance
on
bebras
is
only
moderately
correlated
to
the
student
grades
we
conclude
that
it
is
not
very
likely
that
ct
measures
can
be
derived
from
the
bebras
test
as
it
is
currently
designed
while
further
research
is
needed
on
how
we
can
leverage
the
bebras
effort
to
extend
it
into
a
ct
assessment
instrument
we
performed
a
preliminary
study
on
the
use
of
item_response_theory
irt
as
a
means
to
improve
the
selection
of
questions
and
the
design
of
the
test
we
expect
the
results
of
this
research
can
contribute
both
to
the
development
and
discussion
on
ct
assessment
as
well
as
to
the
bebras
effort
to
educate
ct

education
research
has
resulted
in
multiple
overlapping
definitions
of
ct
as
an
approach
towards
solving
problems
using
methods
and
tools
that
are
derived
from
computer

our
development
of
operationalized
definitions
of
ct
talent
for
middle

is
focused
on
uniting

builds
on
multiple
distinct

of
the
engineering

process
along
with
concepts
from
systems
engineering
models
and
the

process
we
operationalize
these

to
provide
teachers
with
metrics
and
examples
for
recognizing

assessing
the

some

therefore
a

they
bring
some
indications
that
the

but
still
more

this

full

examines
the

tasks
a
computational

ct
contest
that
does
not
require
programming
knowledge
numerous
studies
in
the
last
decade
shed
light
on
disseminating
ct
practices
however
there
is
still
a
gap
in
understanding
ct
as
a
construct
that
is
ct
as
a
complex
cognitive
dimension
furthermore
few
studies
analyze
how
many
constructs
can
be
recognized
inside
ct
by
empirical
data
moreover
algorithmic_thinking
is
one
of
the
essential
skills
in
ct
even
when
we
do
not
apply
programming
activities
in
this
exploratory
paper
we
investigate
the
bebras
challenge
tasks
our
primary
aim
is
to
figure
out
how
many
and
which
are
the
constructs
associated
with
ct
skills
derived
from
data
especially
related
to
algorithmic_thinking
the
results
point
out
three
primary
constructs
supported
by
data
we
claim
that
these
constructs
are
a
mix
of
ct
skills
mainly
algorithmic_thinking
abstraction
generalization
evaluation
and
pattern
recognition
in
addition
our
study
provides
additional
evidence
supporting
the
idea
that
algorithmic_thinking
can
be
explored
by
different
perspectives
beyond
“a
set
of
order
instructions”
even
without
programming
practices
thus
this
result
reinforces
the
notion
that
ct
can
be
understood
as
a
mix
of
several
skills
to
solve
problems
moreover
algorithmic_thinking
is
a
complex
cognitive
process
of
thought
which
may
be
explored
through
different
strategies
we
believe
that
these
findings
may
help
recognize
which
constructs
and
abilities
underline

algorithmic_thinking

this

explores
a

for
educational
purposes
given
the
well-known

ct
needs
to
be
known
in
the

community
one
crucial
aspect
in
this
regard
is
the
perceptions
that
students
hold
on
the
subject
as
well
as
on
computing
in
general
various
studies
have
been
carried
out
to

however
assessing
the
understanding

particularly
in

education
has
not
been
fully
explored
yet
most
current

are
either
not
aimed
at
educators
or
not
designed
to
cover
elements
related
to
both
ct

in
this
work
our
goal
was
to
evaluate
a
survey
instrument
on
perceptions
of
ct
and
attitudes
towards
computing
for
undergraduate
students
our
evaluation
focused
on
verifying
whether
the
instrument
could
grasp
the
aspects
involved
in
five
different
intended
constructs
1
understanding
of
ct
2
application
of
ct

3
confidence

4
interest

we
computed
its
reliability

results
showed
evidence
that
the

is
both
reliable
and
valid
to
measure
impressions
of
ct

in

is
part

the
first
element
investigated
is
the

two

automatic

load
of

most
existent
autograders
are
based
on
unit
testing
which
focuses
on
the
correctness
of
the
code
but
has
limited
scope
for
judging
code
quality
moreover
it
is
cumbersome
to
implement
unit
testing
for
evaluating
graphical
output
code
we
propose
an
autograder
that
can
effectively
judge
the
code
quality
of
the
visual
output
codes
created
by
students
enrolled
in
a
high_school-level
computational

course
we
aim
to
provide
suggestions
to
teachers
on
an
essential
aspect
of
their
grading
namely
the
level
of
student
com-petency
in
using
abstraction
within
their
codes
a
dataset
from
five
different
assignments
including
open-ended
problems
is
used
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
our
autograder
our
initial
experiments
show
that
our
method
can
classify
the
students
submissions
even
for
open-ended
problems
where
existing
autograders
fail
to
do
so
additionally
survey
responses
from
course
teachers
support
the
importance
of
our
work
the
scientific
and
reasonable
evaluation
indicators
that
can
fully
reflect
the
various
dimensions
of
students
computational

is
the
basis
and
premise
of
accurately
evaluating
students
ct
skills
which
is
of
great
significance
to
the
cultivation
of
students
ct
skills
however
the
current
research
on
how
to
construct
the
evaluation
indicators
is
still
inadequate
and
most
of
the
research
is
put
forward
by
the
subjective
experience
of
researchers
lacking
objectivity
and
the
universality
of

in
the

we
comprehensively
reviewed
the

to
construct
the
comprehensive

effective
evaluation
indicators
of
ct
for
students
by
clustering
the
keywords
of
ct
concepts
and
extracting
indicators
the
validity
of
indicators
is
verified
by
qualitative

quantitative
analysis
and
expert

the
results
show
that
the
evaluation
indicators
of
ct
constructed
by
spectral

are
a
more
scientific
more
comprehensive

ct
skills
this
paper
advocates
for
an
increased
focus
on
computational
identity
ci
and
digital
empowerment
de
in
particular
as
we
posit
that
these
ct
skills
will
help
young
learners
become
self-motivated
innovative
creators
when
nurturing
identity
and
empowerment
it
is
a
persistent
challenge
to
provide
youth
with
real-world
experiences
and
suitable
development
tools
this
paper
advances
two
key
approaches
to
address
these
issues
1
a
critical
computational
literacy
approach
to
engage
youth
in
developing
personally
meaningful
applications
that
have
impact
in
the
real
world
2
the
use
of
a
tool
like
mit
app
inventor
that
lowers
barriers
to
creating
useful
impactful
technology
using
two
case-based
studies
we
show
how
these
two
approaches
have
supported
youth
in
developing
applications
that
respond
to
meaningful
challenges
in
their
communities
and
helped
them
to
establish
their
computational
identities
and
digital
empowerment
computational
thinking
a
problem_solving
method
that
uses
computer
science
techniques
has
recently
become
mainstream
as
many
governments
and
major
internet
companies
are
promoting
programming
skills
among
children
however
little
is
known
about
how
programming
affects
other
aspects
of
life
beyond
the
acquired
programming
skills
in
this
regard
this
paper
summarizes
the
work
done
in
the
school
san
diego
and
san
vicente
madrid
spain
during
the
third
quarter
of
the
year
20132014
where
we
conducted
a
study
with
four
groups
of
students
in
4th
and
5th
grade
to
measure
to
what
extent
the
use
of
computer
programming
in
english
classes
can
be
an
interesting
educational
tool
with
a
positive
impact
on
the
learning
otucome
of
the
students
the
results
show
that
the
groups
working
with
programming
activities
improved
more
than
the
groups
using
traditional
resources
moreover
when
asked
via
surveys
at
the
end
of
the
study
most
students
felt
that
coding
was
a
positive
influence
not
only
for
learning
english
but
for
developing
other
important
skills
as
teamwork
and
learning
to
learn
with
the
introduction
of
fundamental
concept
computational
thinking
block-based
programming
tools
are
turning
into
more
and
more
common
in
primary
middle
and
high_school
level
introductory
classes
block-based
programming
languages
support
users
to
drag
and
drop
different
jigsaw
shaped
blocks
and
snapping
together
to
form
a
program
the
point
of
interest
is
on
the
programming
logic
rather
than
its
syntax
in
this
paper
we
present
db-learn
a
browser-based

this
facilitates

growing
rapidly
especially
in
educational
settings
children
are
exposed
to
computational
thinking
by
making
games
building
scientific
simulations
and
creating
stories
early
educational
programming
languages
such
as
logo
have
made
programming
substantially
more
accessible
to
end-users
more
recent
approaches
include
visual
programming
with
a
drag-and-drop
style
of
programming
that
makes
it
nearly
impossible
to
compose
syntactically
incorrect
programs
however
as
the
syntactic
challenges
of
end-user
programming
are
gradually
fading
into
the
past
the
new
frontier
of
semantic
programming
support
emerges
this
demonstration
introduces
conversational

a
system
to
make

and
their
actual

results
computational
thinking
and
computer

are
instrumental
in
learning
how
to
creatively
solve
problems
and
develop
thought
out
solutions
over
the
years
workshops
have
been
held
to
provide
high_school

the
ability
to
teach
high_school

however
not
much
has
been
done
for
middle

teachers
funded
by
google
the
three

cs
educator
professional
development
workshop
for
middle
school
teachers
at
kean
university
brought
together
teachers
to
learn
about
key
computer
science
concepts
and
work
with
tools
that
were
previously
not
known
to
them
such
as
scratch
the
makey
makey
tool
kit
and
the
cue
robot
the
results
of
this
research
find
that
middle
school
teachers
need
access
to
curriculum
materials
and
digital
tools
in
order
to
successfully
teach
computer
science
to
their
students
furthermore
more
work
should
be
done
to
get
middle
school
teachers
access
to
materials
and
lesson
plans
aimed
at
teaching
middle
school
students
in
this
paper
we
describe
how
to
use
a
game-based_learning
gbl
approach
to
help
end-user
programmers
to
develop
computational
thinking
ct
skills
ct
represents
a
framework
consisting
of
a
set
of
skills
such
as
abstraction
decomposition
and
more
in
general
problem_solving
expressed
in
a
computational
form
algorithmic_thinking
that
can
be
easily
formalised
into
a
computer
program
those
skills
are
beneficial
for
end-user
programmers
in
order
to
model
a
task
for
being
tackled
with
computational
tools
eg
spreadsheets
domain
specific
and
visual
languages
tapasplay
is
an
engaging
gbl
platform
designed
to
help
end-user
to
learn
algorithmic_thinking
how
to
foster
not
only
software
programming
skill
sps
but
also
computational
thinking
ability
cta
of
students
becomes
more
important
however
students
cannot
immediately
understand
learning
problems
and
statuses
in
terms
of
sps
and
cta
even
though
scratch
tool
can
facilitate
the
programming
learning
therefore
a
scheme
of
web-based
learning
activity
integrated
with
scratch
tool
welas
is
proposed
to
assist
learners
in
welas
students
can
learn
the
programming
concepts
and
knowledge
by
sequential
learning
content
hands-on
practice
the
coding
skills
by
embedded
scratch
tool
address
the
task
by
online
prompts
and
reflect
the
learning
status
by
diagnostic
report
consequently
welas
can
be
expected
to
assist
students
in
achieving
the
high
learning
performance
computational
thinking
is
a
skill
that
is
considered
essential
for
the
future
generations
because
of
this
it
should
be
incorporated
into
the
curricula
as
soon
as
possible
many
robots
can
be
programmed
using
graphical
languages
or
physical
blocks
instead
of
writing
code
this
makes
programming
more
accessible
for
the
youngest
programmers
looking
to
extend
the
programming
activities
to
preschool
students
we
present
a
novel
approach
that
allows
to
program
a
mobile
robot
robotito
by
changing
its
environment
we
describe
the
architecture
of
robotito
software
used
to
program
its
interaction
with
the
environment
and
developed
behaviours
moreover
robotito
exports
his
sensors
and
actuators
using
ros
standard
mechanisms
and
is
modelled
in
gazebo
allowing
it
to
be
used
in
research
and
undergraduate
school
courses
providing
researchers
an
autonomous
and
safety
mobile
platform
which
can
be
integrated
with
any
system
using
ros
computational

ct
based
learning
system
is
a
significant
tool
for
developing
the
cognitive
ability
and
problem-solving
skill
both
in
real
life
and
education
this
research
investigates
the
reduction
of
cognitive

way
more
accurately
after
doing
a

but
for
the
measurement
of
the
cognitive

instantly
no
platform
is
used
before
to
overcome
this
problem
the
ultimate
goal
of
this
paper
is
to
construct
a
matlab
gui
for
immediately
measurement
of
electroencephalography
eeg
based
cognitive

individually
to
measure
the

many
high
schools
do
not
have
computer
science
courses
so
students
are
not
introduced
to
this
critical
subject
that
is
needed
for
most
technical
career
paths
our
unique
strategy
is
to
invite
current
high_school
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem
teachers
in
pennsylvania
west
virginia
ohio
and
maryland
to
participate
in
3
summer
workshops
showing
how
to
incorporate
computing
concepts
into
existing
stem
courses
by
working
with
teachers
on
how
to
assimilate
programming
and
computational
thinking
into
their
classrooms
we
will
effectively
reach
a
large
population
of
students
in
areas
where
computer
science
classes
are
not
available
in
this
paper
we
outline
the
current
state
of
the
project
and
some
of
the
data
we
have
collected
future
goals
for
this
project
include
performing
a
rigorous
evaluation
of

solutions
to
container

logistics
systems
ctls
are
falling
short
of
peoples
wishes
both
in

and
in

this
paper
proposes
a
container
terminal
gang
scheduling
computational
paradigm
gscp
for
planning
and
control
at
container
terminals
based
on
computational
thinking
gscp
is
built
on
the
computing
perspective
and
architecture
of
multi-processor
system-on-chip
gscp
applies
principles
of
pervasive
computing
to
evaluate
load
conditions
of
core
resources
and
then
integrates
the
fundamental
principles
of
gang
scheduling
processor
affinity
and
load
balancing
to
define
the
flexible
and
robust
decision
framework
and
scheduling
algorithm
set
those
are
intended
to
improve
the
performance
of
ctls
and
strive
for
balance
among
through
capacity
for

and
containers
task
latency
and
load
leveling
as
well
gscp
is
demonstrated
and
validated
by
a
typical
container

logistics
service
case
with
intensive
computational
experiments
computational
thinking
ct
has
been
integrated
into
k-12
curricula
globally
and
coding
has
been
the
main
vehicle
in
ct
education
while
great
effort
has
been
made
in
exploring
cognitive
effect
of
coding
limited
has
been
done
in
attitudinal
aspects
to
bridge
this
gap
this
study
validated
the
existing
elementary
student
coding_attitudes_survey
escas
in
chinese
context
and
use
the
scale
to
explore
how
students
perceived
coding
also
the
association
between
coding
attitude
and
ct
performance
was
investigated
a
total
of
217
elementary
students
were
involved
psychometric
qualities
of
escas
chinese
were
examined
and
the
effect
of
coding
attitudes
on
ct
cognitive
performance
was
analyzed
with
linear
regression
results
showed
that
escas
chinese
was
a
valid
and
reliable
attitudinal
scale
and
coding
interest
could
predict
ct
performance
future
directions
for
the
study
were
discussed
this
paper
presents
the
initial
results
of
a
research
that
aims
to
evaluate
the
contribution
of
the
scratch
visual
programming
language
in
the
development
of
computational
thinking
in
comparison
to
the
use
of
pseudocode
the
comparison
scenario
was
the
teaching
of
programming
logic
for
higher_education
students
of
the
physics
course
the
research
was
outlined
with
the
methodology
of
action
research
allowing
the
evaluation
of
the
use
of
language
at
the
end
of
the
approach
of
each
content
delivered
during
the
research
the
presented
results
refer
to
the
approach
of
two
contents
of
the
four
established
for
the
conclusion
of
the
research
the
steps
of
approaching
each
content
were
initiated
with
the
application
of
the
diagnostic
evaluation
and
finalized
with
the
evaluation
of
performance
the
results
indicate
a
progression
in
knowledge
about
programming
logic
in
this
way
it
was
possible
to
verify
that
the
use
of
the
scratch
language
contributed
to
the
learning
of
programming
logic
in
this
paper
we
present
an
interactive
learning
environment
ile
called
cra
y
juega
focused
on
the
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
using
block-based
visual
language
programing
with
a
3d
physics
simulation
system
it
includes
a
programmable
interaction
system
based
on
hand
movement
and
gesture
recognition
that
allows
to
easily
create
and
use
customized
hand
gestures
for
interaction
with
3d
objects
in
a
virtual
environment
by
applying
the
tam
model
to
discover
the
motivation
enjoyment
and
behavioral
intention
to
use
the
results
show
that
1
using
nui
technologies
in
interactive
learning
environments
improve
the
enjoyment
and
the
perceived
ease
of
use
2
perceived
enjoyment
was
a
significant
issue
in
the
intention
to
use
3
nuis
interfaces
during

steam-blended
programming
education
is
considered
to
be
particularly
effective
for
training
computational
thinking
in
this
paper
we
aim
to
develop
a
web-based
learning
environment
for
steam-blended
programming
education
the
proposed
system
can
provide
the
learning
materials
of
javascript
that
can
easily
carry
out
steam
education
at
educational
institutions
to
effectively
realize
steam-blended
programming
education
visual
programming
is
useful
therefore
first
we
will
examine
the
learning
effectiveness
of
visual
programming
next
we
will
develop
a
web-based
programming
learning
support
system
based
on
in
this
article
we
examine
a
female-oriented
high_school
computing
outreach
program
flames
consisting
of
an
8-week
high_school
summer
intern
program
run
within
a
university
computer
science
cs
department
we
focus
on
examining
the
effects
of
the
program
on
students
skills
and
affect
towards
computing
much
of
the
literature
in
cs
outreach
research
examines
summer
camps
after-school
programs
and
other
school-year
events
that
often
have
a
focus
on
only
teaching
students
computing
content
our
program
is
unique
and
socially
relevant
as
students
are
trained
to
assist
teachers
with
the
development
of
computational
thinking-infused
curricula
for
their
classrooms
this
paper
presents
the
design
of
our
program
an
overview
of
the
curriculum
and
results
including
both
student
and
teacher
feedback
results
show
that
the
program
has
benefited
each
of
the
parties
involved
including
its
student
participants
facilitators
and
the
teachers
assisted
by
the
participants
we
share
our
lessons
learned
in
order
to
help
other
cs
departments
develop
similar
broadening
participation
in
computing
programs
in
view
of
the
teaching
actual
situation
of
the
basic
computer
course
taking
c
language
programming
as
an
example
this
paper
analyzes
the
characteristics
of
the
course
and
puts
forward
the
reform
program
of
the
blended
teaching
mode
combined
with
flipped_classroom
the
teaching
effect
improved
significantly
it
strengthens
the
students
ability
of
computational

self-learning
ability
and
innovation
ability
finally
this
paper
carries
on
the
thinking
and
the
summary
to
the
teaching
reform
work
in

to
continuously
improve
the

quality
algorithmic_thinking
is
one
of
the
main
key
concepts
in
computational
thinking
with
using
computers
in
close
to
all
areas
of
our
lives
the
progress
of
algorithmic
solutions
to
problems
is
very
crucial
the
comprehension
of
the
character
of
problems
and
their
algorithmic
solutions
is
enormously
most
important
for
everyone
algorithmic_thinking
is
the
capability
to
realize
execute
assessment
and
create
computational
procedures
for
solving
problems
this
paper
presents
alg-design
a
visual
and
block
based
programming
environment
to
facilitate
novices
to
improve
the
comprehension
of
algorithmic_thinking
using
programming
and
computing
the
visual
programming
environment
motivates
students
and
they
find
enjoyable
while
creating
personally
meaningful
projects
unlike
enrollment
in
undergraduate
computer
science
degree
programs
there
are
no
gender
or
ethnic
imbalances
in
k-12
enrollment
while
such
disparities
are
seen
at
particular
schools
such
disparities
do
not
exist
in
disciplinary
courses
such
as
history
math
or
science
where
all
students
are
required
to
take
these
courses
this
paper
discusses
an
approach
to
broaden
minority
participation
in
computing
through
the
integration
of
computer
science
cs
into
a
history
course
this
poster
proposes
an
alignment
between
computational
thinking
and
historical
thinking
that
makes
history
courses
an
attractive
fit
for
cs
integration
it
also
presents
results
from
the
pilot
study
of
a
project-based
cross-disciplinary
curriculum
using
mit
app
inventor
that
leverages
students
interests
in
mobile
technology
to
facilitate
the
creation
of
historical
mobile
apps
this
curricular
approach
is
built
on
a
theoretical
framework
rooted
in
constructivist
and
constructionist
learning
where
students
construct
and
produce
knowledge
artifacts
and
technology
rather
than
consume
them
our
initial
results
suggest
that
students
were
engaged
in
the
material
and
were
enthusiastic
about
the
creation
of
their
mobile
app
this
paper
proposes
a
block-based
programming
learning
environment
through
animated
pictogram
content
creation
named
“pictoch”
pictograms
are
constructed
objects
at
a
high
level
of
abstraction
abstraction
decomposition
and
pattern
recognition
which
are
all
core
concepts
of
computational
thinking
are
also
essential
ability
for
pictogram
content
creation
and
if
the
structure
of
pictograms
can
be
described
as
a
procedural
program
then
it
is
based
on
algorithmic_thinking
pictoch
especially
focuses
on
human
pictogram
this
effect
of
the
human
pictogram
can
be
familiar
with
“syntonic
learning”
advocated
by
papert
pictoch
has
the
instructions
for
posing
and
motion
of
human
pictogram
and
some
more
essential
functions
for
making
pictograms
that
drawing
various
objects
and
attaching
safety
signs
this
paper
introduces
this
application
and
describes
its
various
basic
functions
and
additional
functions
for
class
use
this
paper
puts
forward
that
organizing
teaching
of
database
course
should
take
database
design
as
trunk
line
to
cultivate
ability
of
computational
thinking
the
teaching
organization
starts
from
application
scenarios
and
combines
database
theoretical
knowledge
with
the
process
from
analysis
modeling
to
establishing
database
application
using
this
method
to
organize
teaching
the
students
learn
to
know
the
how
and
the
why
not
only
to
understand
what
database
is
but
also
understand
and
grasp
how
to
use
how
to
better
use
of
database
thus
their
ability
on
analyzing
and
solving
concrete
problem
is
improved
the
growth
of
the
geospatial
services
industry
is
increasing
the
demand
for
graduates
with
training
in
both
geography
and
computational
thinking
geocomputational
thinking
the
limited
availability
of
learning
pathways
towards
geocomputationally
intensive
jobs
requires
employers
across
the
public
and
private
sectors
to
choose
between
hiring
a
geographer
or
a
computer

will
initiate
the
formation
of
a

with
the
aim
to
address
both
the
problems
detected
as
the
educational
gaps
associated
to
the
acquisition
of

operating
system
and
a
development
board
which
the
students
can
debugging
their

to
improve

it
is
of
supreme
importance
that
students
are
able
to
make
connections
between
knowledge
and
its
application
to
a
real

context
two
such
cases
of

have
been
presented
in
this
paper
which
was
modeled
in

a
contextual
strategy
used
to
enhance
accounting
and
it
skills
in
undergraduate
students
at

college
higher
colleges
of

we
posited
that
through
this
contextualized
approach
students
would
see
accounting

and
app
development
as
tools
for
solving
work-related
problems
using
constructivist

strategy
we
initiated

of
both
accounting
and
it
which
deviates
from
traditional
teaching
model
where
learning
of
a
subjects
is
isolated
from
any

we
conclude
that
the
interdisciplinary
projects
implemented
were
a
robust
technique
for
application
of
contextual

the
most
important
outcome
was
achieving

we
adopted
an
iterative

and
investigated
the
effectiveness
of

projects
in
addition
entrepreneurial
components
were
incorporated
into
a
series
of
senior

graduate-level
courses
with
the
goal
of
creating
student
entrepreneurs
the
entrepreneurship-focused
curriculum
encouraged
students
to
participate
in

the
findings
from
this

we
discuss
how
to
teach

to
all
levels
of
students
computational
literacy
is
an
important
ability
to
understand
and
communicate
information
in
current
digital
age
and
ubiquitous
age
the
digital
has
been
used
as
a
tool
of
communication
along
with
language
therefore
we
would
need
to
have
ability
to
express
our
idea
and
understand
an
others
presentation
with
language
and
digital
which
is
just
computational
literacy
however
most
educators
focus
on
using
computer
and
internet
not
computational
literacy
therefore
we
define
the
operational
definition
about
computational
literacy
suited
for
the
present
age
by
analyzing
existing
computational
literacy
in
addition
we
extract
educational
factors
from
the
relation
with
computational
thinking
that
is
the
purpose
of
computational
literacy
finally
we
discuss
teaching-learning
strategy
of
computational
literacy
for
all
level
s
of
students
the
teaching
of

and
lack
of
technological
resources
these
are
factors
that
limit
the
teaching
of
computing
in
the
education
of
children
as
a
solution
to
this
problem
the
project
called
“scratchton”
is
created
which
looks
forward
to
bringing
technology
to
children
in
an
efficiently
and
easy
way
this
consists
in
a
programming
contest
where
kids
develop
a
game
based
on
a
given
theme
where
participants
need
to
complete
the
challenge
with
the
help
of
scratch
tools
that
were
previously
taught
through
video
tutorials
with
this
the
goal
is
to
encourage
children
to
have
better
analytical
skills
to
awake
computational
thinking
and
to
increase
interest
in
programming
through
incentives
and
recognition
learning
programming
language
syntax
is
considered
an
obstacle
in
programming
education
however
we
believe
it
is
an
overlooked
opportunity
to
exploit
obvious
synergies
with
math
as
evidenced
around
the
world
middle
and
high_school
students
know
the
syntax
required
to
compute
simple
expressions
without
previous
exposure
to
programming
languages
we
make
the
case
for
an
“expressions
first”
approach
to
facilitate
the
development
of
computational
thinking
our
approach
has
the
benefit
of
integrating
directly
with
math
which
in
turn
reinforces
the
teaching
of
other
stem
subjects
as
well
as
non-stem
ones
we
report
early
results
of
an
ongoing
trial
using
a
visual
computing
environment
that
supports
this
approach
the
logical
equivalence
of
selection
structure
in
different
programming
languages
is
common
sense
but
it
is
difficult
for
junior
high_school
students
to
understand
the
relationship
this
thesis
is
based
on
this
exploration
and
practice
so
that
students
can
solve
the
programming
problems
encountered
when
designing
app
on
the
app
inventor
platform
through
the
smart
planting
project
and
on
the
basis
of
mastering
the
content
of
the
new
textbook
c
language
so
as
to
improve
students’
computational
thinking
and
the
ability
to
analyze
problems
and
solve
problems
the
subject
of
the
computability
of
the
mind
introduces
complex
philosophical
ethical
and
technical
issues
that
aside
this
topic
draws
us
in
to
the
nature
of
algorithms
we
are
surrounded
by
algorithms
much
of
the
history
of
computing
is
also
the
history
of
the
advance
of
algorithms
for
the
public
algorithms
are
part
of
computings
self-made
mystery
but
to
understand
their
nature
is
an
important
part
of
computational
thinking
the

reading
his

column
in
which
he
introduces
the
complex
philosophical
ethical
and
technical
issues
associated
with
the
idea
that
the
mind
can
be
understood
as
a
computer
the
jigsaw
pedagogy
as
a
student-centered
instructional
approach
has
been
successfully
applied
in
information
technology
classrooms
but
there
is
a
lack
of
empirical
research
on
the
effectiveness
of
jigsaw
pedagogy
in
unplugged
environments
therefore
this
study
combined
the
jigsaw
pedagogy
with
unplugged_activities
and
verified
the
teaching
effect
of
such
a
combination
through
randomized
group
experiments
the
results
of
the
study
showed
that
the
combination
of
the
jigsaw
pedagogy
and
the
unplugged_activities
was
more
conducive
to
promoting
students
motivation
and
the
development
of
computational

than
the
unplugged

alone
drawing
upon
the
research
findings
this

concluded
with
several
implications
for
teachers
to
reform

investigates
the
impact
of
childrens

fluency
and
its
relationship
to
the
structure
of
the
programming
code
aiming
to
determine
the
best
age
to
start
teaching
programming
a
mixed-methods
approach
was
employed
combining
quantitative
assessments
with
qualitative
observations
to
assess
childrens
development
of
computational
skills
the
study
focused
on
block
coding
particularly
using
the
scratch
programming
language
to
enhance
childrens
program-ming
fluency
the
findings
reveal
that
block
coding
significantly
improves
programming
fluency
especially
for
children
between
10
and
15
highlighting
the
importance
of
code
structure
in
helping
young
learners
better
understand
programming
concepts
such
as
encapsulation
this
study
emphasizes
the
value
of
early
programming
education
and
offers
insights
into
effective
teaching
methods
to
promote
computational
thinking
and
creativity
in
young

ct
is
a
crucial
21st-century
skill
and
its
integration
into
k–12

underscores
the
need
for
effective

were
developed
to

twenty-two
experts
were
invited
to

results
indicated
that
the

and
several
modifications
were
made
to

for
ct
practices
when
the
classical
theory
of
problem_solving
is
put
into
practice
a
sequence
of
operator
applications
must
be
found
that
transforms
an
initial
problem
state
into
a
goal
state
this
is
equivalent
to
finding
a
path
through
the
graph
of
possible
problem
states
from
an
initial
node
to
a
goal
node
the
search
is
usually
conducted
by
an
algorithm
or
by
a
human
through
an
iterative
process
of
selecting
and
applying
operators
to
states
found
so
far
here
i
demonstrate
examples
of

in
the
design
of
new
problem-solving
affordances
that
may
enhance
the
abilities
of
human
solvers
to
understand
and
solve
problems
this
opens
up
new
ways
to
conceptualize
the
process
of
solving

and
it
suggests
new
ways
to
teach
a
form
of

been
brought
up
for
national
attention
and
recognized
as
one
of
the
essential
competencies
among

disciplines
the
technology
is
progressing
nowadays
and
the
threshold
of
accessing
computer

is
more
and
more
diversified
for
the

we
hope
to
bring
students
to
learn

naturally
in
the
ways
of

which
will
induce
the
students
to
learn
the

as
such
developing
powerful

is
an
important

teachers
living
and
working
in
rural
areas
in
the
united
states
often
lack
access
to
high-quality
professional
development
pd
opportunities
as
computer
science
cs
and
computational
thinking
ct
education
pathways
increasingly
develop
in
rural
districts
it
is
essential
to
provide
quality
pd
for
their
teachers
so
they
can
identify
opportunities
for
and
plan
to
embed
cs
and
ct
learning
in
their
classrooms
a
key
element
in
delivering
high-quality
pd
is
understanding
the
specific
educational
and
wider
cultural
needs
of
the
community
where
it
will
be
delivered
something
we
call
“mining
cultural
capital”
in
this
poster
we
report
on
the
delivery
of
four
30-minute
virtual
pd
sessions
within
two
rural
school
districts
in
eastern
kentucky
pikeville
independent
and
floyd
county
schools
the
virtual
sessions
were
specifically
geared
toward
elementary
and
middle
school
teachers
the
sessions
were
led
by
a
long-time
educator
in
the
region
who
worked
to
curate
relevant
examples
and
delivered
the
pd
via
a
recorded
video
conference
the
recordings
are
available
for
teachers
in
the
region
to
watch
and
re-watch
as
they
develop
their
lessons
survey
results
showed
that
participating
teachers
found
the
pd
to
be
valuable
furthermore
feedback
from
teachers
suggests
that
access
to
these
short
just-in-time
pd
sessions
provided
valuable
learning
opportunities
and
also
sparked
new
lesson
ideas
for
teachers
in
recent
years
the
interest
in
data
science
has
increased
in
both
industry
and
academia
historically
access
to
this
discipline
has
been
redirected
to
stem
professionals
however
the
ubiquity
of
cloud
computing
and
the
simplicity
of
modern
programming
languages
such
as
python
and
r
have
enabled
non-stem
students
and
professionals
to
leverage
it
especially
to
analyze
data
similarly
with
what
has
been
conveyed
with
computational
thinking
in
terms
of
enabling
non-stem
students
with
com
technological
competencies
this
article
aims
to
present
a
proposal
for
improving
the
teaching
of
data
science
specifically
to
non-stem
students
how
can
educational
technologists
most
effectively
support
children
in
their
development
of
computational
thinking
this
project
attempts
to
integrate
recent
evidence
from
embodied
cognitive
science
with
concreteness
fading
an
instructional
theory
popular
in
mathematics
and
science
education
through
a
series
of
classroom
studies
i
will
investigate
the
effectiveness
of
the
concrete-pictorial-abstract
sequence
and
the
relative
benefits
of
physical
and
virtual
implementations
of
the
concrete
stage
results
will
be
used
to
guide
the
development
of
an
interactive
learning
environment
for
use
in
primary_school
classrooms
introducing
middle
school
students
to
steam
projects
can
foster
an
interest
in
computer
science
and
engineering
solutions
these
projects
provide
hands-on
experiences
that
may
encourage
students
to
explore
careers
in
science
technology
engineering
art
and
mathematics
engaging
students
in
real-world
problems
can
help
them
develop
critical_thinking
skills
and
generate
innovative
ideas
steam
projects
can
also
spark
students
curiosity
and
creativity
this
paper
will
explore
developing
and
implementing
a
steam
lesson
to
introduce
students
to
the
engineering
and
design
process
and
computational
thinking
moreover
this
project
also
addresses
a
major
environmental
concern
currently
in
new
jersey
specifically
the
destruction
of
the
environment
by
the
spotted
lanternfly
therefore
students
are
also
applying
skills
in
civil
duty
and
environmental
awareness
as
a
part
of
their
design
and
plan
to
eradicate
this
invasive
species
the
systematic
solutions
to
planning
and
scheduling
for
container
terminal
logistics
systems
ctls
have
been
scarce
owing
to
their
high
complexity
and
strong
randomness
this
paper
extended
the
past
research
on
modeling
ctls
with
computer
composition
principles
and
architecture
the
comparability
and
the
further
mapping
relationships
between
ctls
and
multi-processor
system-on-chip
mpsoc
were
discussed
at
great
length
within
the
theoretical
viewpoints
of
computational
thinking
whereafter
a
container
terminal
logistics
computational
architecture
was
put
forward
for
scheduling
and
execution
using
the
perspective
of
mpsoc
which
was
established
on
the
conceptual
framework
and
fundamental
principles
of
distributed
parallel
and
cooperative
computing
in
essence
finally
the
approach
was
demonstrated
by
investigating
the
stress
testing
load
balancing
and
process
behavior
of
a
typical
container
terminal
logistics
service
case
in
contrast
with
the
previous
work
based
on
the
comprehensive
computational
experiments
over
the
past
decade
the
teaching
of
coding
and
computational
thinking
has
become
increasingly
important
in
the
school
environment
if
before
they
were
a
secondary
part
of
the
teaching
program
and
provided
only
at
best
from
the
age
of
eleven
and
up
it
is
now
clear
that
they
should
play
a
relevant
role
in
the
school
curriculum
as
soon
as
possible
in
recent
years
many
solutions
both
papery
and
software
applications
have
been
developed
for
encoding
however
the
remaining
problem
is
that
every
available
solution
has
been
designed
for
a
very
precise
and

using
game
design
and
programming
to
foster
computational
thinking
acquisition
has
proved
to
be
a
successful
strategy
in
recent
years
in
previous
research
with
agent_sheets
we
concluded
that
the
semiotic
richness
of
this
visual
programming
environment
specifically
designed
to
support
computational
thinking
acquisition
could
be
explored
more
extensively
to
the
benefit
of
learners
in
particular
we
realized
that
there
are
some
additional
representations
of
agent_sheets
games
and
simulations
that
are
not
presented
as
programming
tools
in
the
interface
and
yet
they
communicate
new
relevant
meanings
to
the
users
this
paper
reports
on
research
where
we
artificially
introduced
such
representations
in
a
small
follow-up
experiment
with
selected
participants
from
our
previous
research
experiment
our
goal
was
to
investigate
the
impact
of
such
additional
representations
on
program
comprehension
and
modification
tasks
to
this
end
we
contrasted
empirical
evidence
of
their
performance
in
the
two
tasks
with
their
verbal
account
of
experience
with
agent_sheets
we
used
a
combination
of
discourse
analysis
and
inspections
using
semiotic
engineering
methods
and
the
cognitive
dimensions
of
notations
framework
our
findings
go
in
two
directions
first
we
observed
that
additional
representations
have
allowed
participants
to
expand
and
correct
previous
learning
therefore
such
representations
can
support
new
teaching
strategies
in
computational
thinking
acquisition
programs
with
agent_sheets
second
we
learned
that
the
combination
of
methods
we
used
to
analyze
empirical
data
-
discourse
analysis
with
semiotic
and
cognitive
inspection
techniques
-
can
be
used
systematically
in
other
research
contexts
holding
the
promise
of
insightful
results
computational
thinking
education
nowadays
gets
more
attention
around
the
world
because
of
its
importance
in
indonesia
computational
thinking
has
not
received
attention
as
much
as
in
other
developed
countries
however
there
is
a
community
that
already
focuses
on
promoting
computational
thinking
to
indonesian
students
through
annual
competitions
which
is
bebras
indonesia
the
problems
that
are
used
in
the
competition
also
have
been
adapted
into
a
game
the
game
aims
to
help
student
practicing
for
the
competition
but
the
game
still
has
several
limitations
to
be
used
by
indonesian
students
therefore
this
paper
researches
similar
games
design
interaction
that
suits
indonesian
students
particularly
for
upper_elementary_school
students
the
type
of
the
game
is
a
serious
game
that
has
the
main
goal
of
learning
an
approach
of
user-centered
design
was
used
to
develop
the
design
interaction
usability
testing
was
conducted
to
verify
the
result
of
the
design
interaction
in
two
iterations
the
result
of
the
research
shows
that
the
design
interaction
is
effective
with
a
score
of
completion
rate
of
100
and
easy
to
learn
with
a
score
of

it
is
also
enjoyable
for

based
on
the

the
introduction
of
computational
thinking
skills
at
school
has
mostly
been
associated
with
programming
skills
in
this
paper
we
present
an
approach
that
is
based
on
modeling
a
skill
that
is
commonly
taught
in
computer
science
degrees
often
in
the
last
years
as
it
is
considered
a
higher-level
complex
skill
modeling
includes
various
thinking
processes
like
abstraction
reduction
structuring
generalization
among
others
that
are
part
of
computational
thinking
in
particular
and
problem_solving
in
general
too
our
hypothesis
is
that
using
different
modeling
techniques
from
computer
science
eg
uml
diagrams
in
several
subjects
at
school
can
be
a
good
way
to
introduce
computational
thinking
therefore
we
have
performed
a
semi-controlled
experiment
with
ni558
students
age
8-16
and
n218
educators
that
have
used
modeling
in
their
lessons
our
results
show
a
promising
effect
of
the
use
of
modeling
in
the

educators
have
a
positive
vision
of

tend
to
be
lower

these
preliminary
results
suggest
that
the
integration
of
introductory
computing
and
robotics
lessons
in
low-ses
classrooms
may
help
students
reach
similar
levels
of
engineering
interest
and
attitudes
as
their
high-ses
peers
as
part
of
the
3d
printing
summer
course
for
undergrads
in
our
university
students
were
introduced
to
autodesk
tinkercad
as
a
design
tool
for
creating
and
editing
3d
models
after
a
brief
period
of
familiarization
with
tinkercad
we
presented
students
with
codeblocks
a
tool
integrated
with
tinkercad
that
enables
the
creation
of
3d
models
through
programming
under
the
blocks
model
to
our
surprise
students
started
creating
complex
and
lengthy
programs
to
produce
original
printable
3d
objects
we
decided
to
investigate
this
level
of
engagement
using
a
questionnaire
to
collect
opinions
and
experiences
from
students
and
a
set
of
metrics
to
categorize
their

work
the
results
obtained
are
presented
in
this
paper
along
with
our
conjectures
on
the
causes
of
the
enthusiasm
observed
with
codeblocks
three
factors
seem
to
have
been
key
in
this
case
diversity
in
the
composition
of
the
student
group
availability
of
3d
printers
to
materialize
designs
and
a
relaxed
environment
where
test
and
failure
were
common
and
acceptable
recent
years
have
seen
increasing
awareness
of
the
need
for
all
students
in
primary
and
secondary_education
to
learn
computer
science
cs
concepts
and
skills
educational
games
hold
significant
potential
to
serve
as
a
platform
for
cs
education
because
they
integrate
engaging
problem_solving
with
effective
pedagogical
strategies
this
potential
is
especially
high
for
narrative-centered
educational
games
that
embed
learning
activities
within
rich
interactive
stories
in
this
paper
we
present
an
educational
game
featuring
block-based
programming
challenges
contextualized
within
an
engaging
narrative
designed
to
promote
cs
learning
for
middle
school
students
ages
11
to
13
in
the
game
students
undertake
problem-solving
challenges
that
are
aligned
with
the
k-12
computer
science
framework
results
from
a
classroom
implementation
of
the
game
with
middle
grade
students
suggest
that
their
perceived
game
control
ratings
are
positively
correlated
with
their
progress
in
the
game
which
suggests
the
need
for
adaptively
supporting
students
game-based_learning
activities
building
on
these
findings
we
discuss
design
implications
for
creating
student-adaptive
cs
learning
experiences
in
educational
games
that
incorporate
block-based
programming
enriched
narrative-centered
gameplay
the
growth
of
employment
opportunities
in
the
information
technology
sector
and
the
shortage
of
well-trained
professionals
in
this
field
are
a
recurring
theme
in
recent
years
in
both
europe
and
north
america
in
this
sense
research
studies
that
analyse
the
causes
of
the
reduction
of
students
who
are
interested
in
computer
science
mainly
point
to
young
people
being
unaware
of
the
type
of
tasks
computer
scientists
perform
therefore
in
order
to
try
to
reverse
this
trend
many
types
of
initiatives
have
been
organized
seeking
to
bring
the
world
of
computing
to
children
and
adolescents
we
have
been
running
summer
computing
camps
at
the
university
of
limerick
ireland
since
2010
the
three-day
camps
are
offered
to
boys
and
girls
aged
14
and
up
during
the
summer
of
2015
we
ran
two
computing
camps
where
we
focused
on
strategy
development
for
the
chainreaction
board
game
with
the
jabc
workflow
modelling
framework
for
the
first
time
in
this
paper
we
describe
the
freely
available
software
packages
and
the
camp
programme
that
we
designed
around
them
problem_solving
analyzing
the
validity
of
a
solution
and
spotting
patterns
in
data
are
all
substantial
skills
needed
in
the
workplace
nowadays
not
only
in
the
programming
field
solving
and
generating
multiple
solutions
to
a
problem
is

according
to
the
evaluation
carried
out
in
this

was
proven
to
be

which
indicates
that
the
serious

we
have
administered
the

project
taaas
to
reveal
the
computer
problem_solving
approaches
of
first

students
of
informatics
their
expectations
considering
tertiary
studies
and
their
relationship
with
computer

informatics
the
results
clearly
indicate
that
the
students
selected
this
major
on
their
own
based
on
their
previous
experiences
in
informatics
but
that
these
experiences
caused
misconceptions
rather
than
creating
a
true
picture
of
the
nature
of
computer
sciences
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
students
answers
we
concluded
that
they
are
in
great
need
of
institutional
support
especially
at
the
beginning
of
their
tertiary
studies
to
introduce
them
to
computer

beyond
this
we
have
revealed
another
misconception
that
software
engineering
students
tend
to
focus
on
the
coding
aspect
of
informatics
and
especially
those
who
have
taken
the

are
over-confident
as

the
project
in
an
after-school
learning
program
lasted
for
five
weeks
during
weekly
learning
session
each
student
needed
to
use
one
visual

ozobot
the
study
adopted
a

to
teach
the
fundamentals
of
computer

codecraft
provides
users
with
an
intuitive
graphical
interface
for
writing

however
codecraft
is
a
video
game
that
uses
a
problem-based_learning
approach
in
which
players
learn
programming
concepts
by
solving
individual
puzzles
in
an
immersive
3d
environment
moreover
codecraft
is
intended
to
be
an
autonomous
learning
game
that
can
be
played
without
teacher
support
thereby
potentially
reaching
students
in
all
economic
ethnic
and

we
have
seen
a
growing
interest
of
using

at
our
secondary

during
the
past
six
years
however
the
transition
from
using
the
still
prevalent
pascal
to
python
is
often
only
formal
regardless
of
the
language
specifics
of
python
in
addition
teaching
programming
is
oriented
primarily
to
mastering
language
constructions
in
the

of
the
national

academy
we
have
focused
on
inquiry-based

then
they
explore
a

and
give
explanation
for
their

then
elaborate

and
finally
are

their

this

is
focused
on
identifying

acquisition
we
claim
that
mathematical

related
to
induction
inference
and
logical

are
among
such
knowledge
to
confirm
it
we
conducted
a
quasi-experiment
with

we
analysed
their
mathematical

the

was
too
small
to
allow
for
strong
assertions
however
the

indicates
a
possible
correlation
between
mathematical
abilities
and

potential
also
students
repute
the
logic
of
programming
and
teaching

as
the
main
sources
of

furthermore
many
of

prefer
to
ask

widely
used
to
improve
the

process
in

education
deployment
of
a

is
extremely
complex
given
the
fact
that
both
knowledge
and
skills
for
the
science
equations
and
the
computational
and
programming
aspects
are
required
for
a
fully

the

moreover
the

aspects
can
become
even
more
complex
if

with
an

influence
the
cognitive

for
this
first
stage
we
conducted
a
pilot
study
aimed
at
conducting
a
differentiated
measurement
of
cognitive
loads
through
secondary
tasks
and
a
subjective

the
pilot
study
consisted
of
three
moments
the
first
one
focused
on
measuring
their
working
memory
capacity
and
their
prior
knowledge
of

then
students
worked
on
a
learning
activity
focused
on
using
chi-square
and
pearson
correlation
to
conduct
inferential
analyses
the
study
included
two
different
instructional
designs
in
the
form
of
computational
notebooks
design
1
consisted
of
correct
and
incomplete
examples
while
design
2
included
correct
incomplete
and
incorrect
examples
simultaneously
students
had
to
attend
to
a
secondary
task
which
consisted
of
responding
to
an
auditory
stimulus
after
which
they
had
to
press
a
key
on
their
keyboard
finally
students
completed
a
naïve
rating
scale
of
cognitive
loads
involved
in
the
task
the
results
highlight
the
important
role
of
prior
knowledge
in
different
instructional
designs
and
how
it
connects
to
students
perceived
cognitive
effort
likewise
the

suggesting
a

to
compare
between
two

moreover
when

however
studies
show
that
this

nevertheless
little

of
the
university
of

we
used
the

tool
for
the

of
recreational
educational

the
use
of
this

made
it
possible
on

hand
by
improving

scratch
programming
teaching
in

is
of
great
importance
to
the
growth

the
visual

are
suitable
for
teaching
elementary_school
students
which
can
also
better
cultivate

enhance
their
logical_thinking
however
only
a
part
of

and
students
are
currently
learning
this
programming
and
it
is
not
popular
enough
yet
moreover
if
the
teaching
is
mainly
based
on
the
teacher’s
explanation
it
will
be
boring
therefore
there
is
a
need
to
explore
the
teaching
based
on
game
design
and
combine
teaching
with
fun
so
that
learning
can
become
a
more
acceptable
“game”

we
also
discuss
the
initial
phase
of
our
curricular
implementation
strategy
in
two
disciplinary
engineering
programs
at
msu
and
transfer
programs
at
lcc
until
relatively
recently
technology
has
been
used
as
a
passive
tool
that
makes
the
learner
a
user
of
various
applications
however
this
has
been
changing
thanks
to
the
widespread
idea
that
all
children
should
have
the
opportunity
to
learn
a
little
computer
skills
from
an
early
age
since
they
will
live
in
a
world
where
computing
is
everywhere
aware
that
the
teaching
of
programming
is
not
the
future
but
the
present
countries
such
as
the
united
states
singapore
estonia
and
even
spain
face
this
strategic
challenge
which
not
only
prepares
students
for
an
increasingly
technological
labour
market
it
encourages
the
development
of
useful
skills
for
any
student
regardless
of
their
future
professional
activity
with
this
idea
in
mind
this
article
describes
the
case

carried
out
in
a
classroom
of
early_childhood_education
with
students
of
5
years
of
age
with
which
basic
programming
concepts
have
been
worked
out
the
results
obtained
indicate
that
they
have
been
able
to
master
the
new
vocabulary
assimilate
the
concepts
and
work
for
themselves
with
the
chosen
tool
to
carry
out
the
intervention
problems
involving
human
activity
systems
contain
a
soft
element
which
makes
them
hard
to
resolve
using
traditional
approaches
teaching
programming
is
no
difference
in
this
regard
the
presence
of
numerous
factors
makes
it
a
complex
and
messy
situation
however
one
key
contributor
to
this
problem
is
the
differences
in
perception
of
the
parties
involved
this
paper
aims
to
analyze
the
problem
of
teaching
programming
within
a
computer

department
at
omar
elmukhtar
university
omu
through
the
application
of
soft

methodology
ssm
in
addition
to
investigating
the
effects
and
benefits
of
using
such
an
approach
in
order
to
suggest
a
solution
through
constructing
a
root
definition
and
conceptual
model
we
were
able
to
provide
a
standard
to
which
the
current
organization
can
be
compared
against
and
therefore
achieve
a
better
understanding
regarding
which
changes
need
to
be
carried
out
in
order
to
attain
the
systems
desired
results
in
this
paper
we
present
a
browser-based
visual
and
media-rich
programming
platform
for
k-12
schools
that
allows
novices
to
create
complex
3d

this
provides
an
easy
way
for
designers

to
imagine
the
development
of
an

the
word
computation
has
received
increased
attention
in
todays

because
of
its
applicability
in
all

this
tool
is
very
helpful
for
the
user
who
doesnt
have

and
they
want
to

to
engage
in

and
built
self-efficacy
through

findings
from
this
pilot
study
shed
light
on
how
to
mobilize
latine
and
multilingual
students’
rich
languages
and
cultures
for
equitable
computer
science
learning
in
this
paper
we
create
a
learning
path
and
curate
projects
that
let
students
learn
certain
computational_concepts
in
a
consistent
way
that
bridges
story
conversation
visual
programming
and
text-based
programming
our
approach
is
to
provide
young
children
with
both
visual
and
text-based
programming
materials
that
are
directly
associated
with
the
computational
logic
in
some
selected
children’s
daily
dialogues
and
stories
we
demonstrate
this
combo-design
idea
with
examples
of
roleplaying
snap
program
and
python
code
our
design
pattern
and
examples
could
be
adapted
to
other
suitable
children’s
activities
in
different
school
settings
on
a
variety
of
technology
platforms
computation
is
an
increasingly
essential
tool
for
doing
scientific
research
it
is
expected
that
future
engineers
will
need
to
engage
and
understand
computing
in
order
to
work
effectively
with
computational
systems
technologies
and
methodologies
toward
this
goal
we
leverage
our
previous
work
with
sugaraid
v02
to
allow
learners
to
test
their
knowledge
of
computing
by
applying
engineering
concepts
applied
concepts
include
designing
multidisciplinary
systems
including
electrical
mechanical
fluidic
and
thermal
components
through
this
method
we
expect
learners
to
enhance
their
computing
knowledge
by
applying
their
engineering
knowledge
one
of
the
ways
to
demonstrate
subject-domain
concepts
is
to
let
the
learner
play
in
the
domain-related
sandbox
while
receiving
the
explanations
of
the
domain
laws
that
were
broken
when
the
user
makes
a
wrong
move
this
can
help
the
learners
who
understand
definitions
of
the
concepts
poorly
we
present
two
visual
simulators
for
demonstrating
concept
properties
and
domain
laws
implemented
as
web
applications
they
can
be
used
to
study
programming
enabling
trial-and-error
learning
supported
by
the
error
messages
explaining
why
the
users
action
was
wrong
mobile
programming
is
one
of
the
fastest
growing
approaches
in
many
fields
such
as
marketing
or
e-commerce
from
the
educational
perspective
this
means
that
students
should
understand
that
they
can
build
mobile
applications
apps
without
being
professionals
and
at
the
same
time
recognize
their
own
potential
to
use
technology
in
any
professional
path
they
choose
this
goal
is
not
trivial
even
if
students
are
in
general
curious
and
open
to
learn
about
the
creation
of
apps
indeed
especially
in
liberal
education
students
get
discouraged
upfront
as
they
perceive
programming
as
a
difficult
task

learning
to
use
computational
tools
is
a
critical
aspect
of
many
first-year
engineering
courses
students
in
these
courses
can
have
varying
degrees
of
prior
exposure
to
computational
tools
and
often
exhibit
a
wide
range
of
intrinsic
motivation
for
learning
these
skills
interviews
with
first-year
engineering
students
were
conducted
to
study
the
degree
to
which
motivation
correlated
with
intended
major
within
engineering
the
pilot
round
of
interviews
was
conducted
in
the
spring
of
2021
this
pilot
study
used
the
same
data
set
of
8
interviews
to
progressively
refine
both
the
survey
and
interview
collection
in
the
2021
–
2022
academic
year
this
paper
will
review
the
results
of
the
pilot
study
and
detail
the
process
used
to
develop
and
use
the
finalized
protocol
and
coding
schemes
for
a
planned
series
of
20
interviews
in
summer
2022
while
this
technique
developed
because
of
limited
data
collection
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
it
has
been
beneficial
to
the
researcher
and
may
provide
guidance
for
future
researchers
students
in
sophomore
computer
science
ldquocs

are
required
to
study
the
properties
of
a
number
of
standard
data
structures
that
is
common
patterns
of
organizing
data
in
a
computer
program
typically
students
are
first
presented
with
diagrams
that
graphically
depict
the
data
structure
and
then
shown
sample
code
that
actually
implements
it
we
have
observed
however
that
there
is
a
sizable
gap
between
these
two
representations
and
that
many
students
who
master
the
former
have
great
difficulty
translating
that
knowledge
into
the
latter
we
suspect
that
our
pedagogy
could
be
made
more
effective
by
treating
diagrams
themselves
as
formal
entities
and
providing
students
with
a
way
of
mapping
operations
on
the
ldquoeasyrdquo
pictorial
domain
into
the
ldquohardrdquo
programmatic
domain
to
help
develop
this
technique
we
carried
out
a
semester-long
experiment
in
which
students
demonstrated
their
understanding
of
the
material
both
in
diagrams
and
in
code
the
goal
was
to
ascertain
the
kinds
of
mistakes
that
are
often
made
and
how
a
technique
like
this
could
be
most
effective
software

dsd
however
this

has
proven
difficult
to
adopt
or

institutionalizing
such

this
innovative

was
implemented
at

in
an
introduction
to

course
course
assessments
included
weekly
homework
assignments
an
open-ended

one
quiz
and
three
midterm
exams
students
were
explicitly
told
in
class
and
in
the
syllabus
that
no
ai
was
allowed
for
weekly
homework
assignments
however
students
were
encouraged
to
use
ai
for
the
open-ended
project
this
decision
was
made
because
the
problems
on
weekly
assignments
were
more
structured
and
could
be
easily
solved
by
ai
tools
in

the
learning
objective
of
the
project
was
focused
on

making
it
harder
for

indicated
that
they
used
it

and
to
aid
in
debugging

however
grades
on

practice
studies
demonstrating
how

are
rare
thus
we
discussed
the
need
to
introduce

to
industrial

by
presenting
examples
and
ml
tools
with
lower
scientific
thresholds
such
as

to
illustrate
the
bridging

process
further
technical
details
and
industry
case
studies
are
needed
to
demonstrate
evidence
of
the
advantages
of

the
implication
is
not

in
sharpening
the
tools
of

also
in
rethinking

gbo
a

contacted
our

was
proposed
to
keep

living

with
high

of
gang
enrollment
off

while
providing
an

the
police
also
wanted
to
improve

for
the

each

supported
a

of
twelve
african-american

over
three

we
refactored
the

and
organization
of
the

and
present
our
lessons
learned
from
the
experience
over
the
past
decades
numerous
practical
applications
of
machine
learning
techniques
have
shown
the
potential
of
ai-driven
and
data-driven
approaches
in
a
large
number
of
computing
fields
machine
learning
is
increasingly
included
in
computing
curricula
in
higher_education
and
a
quickly
growing
number
of
initiatives
are
expanding
it
in
k-12
computing
education
too
as
machine
learning
enters
k-12
computing
education
understanding
how
intuition
and
agency
in
the
context
of
such
systems
is
developed
becomes
a
key
research
area
but
as
schools
and
teachers
are
already
struggling
with
integrating
traditional
computational
thinking
and
traditional
artificial
intelligence
into
school
curricula
understanding
the
challenges
behind
teaching
machine
learning
in
k-12
is
an
even
more
daunting
challenge
for
computing
education
research
despite
the
central
position
of
machine
learning
and
ai
in
the
field
of
modern
computing
the
computing
education
research
body
of
literature
contains
remarkably
few
studies
of
how
people
learn
to
train
test
improve
and
deploy
machine
learning
systems
this
is
especially
true
of
the
k-12
curriculum
space
this
article
charts
the
emerging
trajectories
in
educational
practice
theory
and
technology
related
to
teaching
machine
learning
in
k-12
education
the
article
situates
the
existing
work
in
the
context
of
computing
education
in
general
and
describes
some
differences
that
k-12
computing
educators
should
take
into
account
when
facing
this
challenge
the
article
focuses
on
key
aspects
of
the
paradigm
shift
that
will
be
required
in
order
to
successfully
integrate
machine
learning
into
the
broader
k-12
computing
curricula
a
crucial
step
is
abandoning
the
belief
that
rule-based
“traditional”
programming
is
a
central
aspect
and
building
block
in
developing
next
generation
computational
thinking
learning
to
program
at
an
early
age
has
been
shown
to
be
a
vehicle
for
the
development
of
computational
thinking
game-based
environments
are
often
used
to
develop
these
skills
but
they
lack
sufficient
voluntariness
to
assess
aspects
related
to
intrinsic
motivation
such
as
interests
skills
persistence
in
solving
a
problem
and
behavior
in
response
to
rewards
these
aspects
directly
affect
achievement
and
academic
performance
so
it
is
necessary
to
analyze
possible
age
and
gender
differences
in
order
to
adjust
computational
thinking
curricula
with
this
aim
we
deployed
a
voluntary
video
game
which
addresses
basic
computational_concepts
based
on
intrinsic
motivation
and
aimed
at
early
ages
data
were
collected
and
analyzed
using
game
learning
analytics
for
15
months
during
which
4124
users
played
more
than
28187
games
the
analysis
shows
significant
age
and
gender
differences
in
relation
to
interests
skills
achievement
and
progression
through
attempts
it
was
observed
that
the
concepts
addressed
were
achievable
between
the
ages
of
3
and
6
years
and
full
mastery
was
possible
by
the
age
of
4
years
regardless
of
gender
as
children
persist
with
the
challenge
intrinsically
motivated
until
it
is
overcome
in
terms

in
this
work
we
present
a
line
of
research
focus
on
the
didactics
of
teaching
and
learning
of
computer
science
for
primary_school
our
approach
combines
the
training
of
teachers
in
computational
thinking
with
unplugged_activities
without
the
use
of
computer
and
plugged
ones
involving
programming
of

and
other

as
a
first
instance
of

we
presents
the
design
and

of
the
computational
thinking
is
a
key
universal
competence
often
taught
using
methods
specific
to
computer
science
one
step
towards
achieving
it
is
learning
to
analyse
and
create
algorithms
researchers
have
long
been
trying
to
establish
how
the
form
of
representation
of
algorithms
pseudocode
versus
flowchart
affects
its
understanding
and
have
reached
varying
sometimes
conflicting
results
this
article
presents
findings
that
provide
objective
new
data
on
this
topic
in
our
experiment
we
used
two
different
types
of
algorithmic
tasks
with
three
levels
of
complexity
and
a
group
of
114
research
participants
with
varying
programming
skills
in
addition
we
used
an
eye
tracking
technique
that
allowed
us
to
collect
detailed
information
about
the
subjects’
attention
distribution
during
analysis
of
algorithms
our
results
show
that
subjects
took
significantly
less
time
to
analyse
flowcharts
than
they
did
with
pseudocode
made
much
fewer
errors
and
had
higher
confidence
in
the
correctness
of
their
solution
based
on
eye
tracking
data
a
reduced
number
of
both
re-analyses
of
the
algorithm
and
input
data
re-referencing
was
observed
for
graphically
presented
tasks
the
difference
in
favour
of
flowcharts
was
revealed
with
few
exceptions
for
all
levels
of
algorithm
complexity
simple
medium
complex
while
regarding
the
duration
of
analysis
the
advantage
of
flowcharts
increased
with
the
growing
complexity
of
algorithms
for
complex
algorithms
a
significant
relationship
was
observed
between
algorithm
presentation
and
level
of
programming
skills
versus
the
duration
of
task
solving
and
confidence
level
our
study
strongly
supports
the
idea
of
using
graphic
representation
of
algorithms
both
when
learning
to
code
and
in
acquiring
computational
thinking

and
their
confidence

a
primary
objective
of
the
cs10k
and
cs
for
all

is
the
education
of
k-12
teachers
in
aspects
of
computer

and
computational

so
they
can
teach
cs
courses
in
their
schools
many
of
these
educators
have
degrees
in
disciplines
other
than
computer
science
such
as
math
science
and
business
so
preparing
them
to
teach
cs
is
a
challenge
particularly
since
most
k-12
teachers
have
limited
time
to
devote
to
learning

this

describes
how
we
managed
a
short
course
in
computational

and
programming
to
a
group
of
high_school
teachers
we
illustrate
through

that
significant
gains
in

and
self-efficacy
can
be
realized
within
a

the
current
covid-19
crisis
has
created
significant
challenges
for
schools
the
growing
importance
of
“flipping
the
classroom”
and
the
needful
emphasizing
of
online-learning
were
owed
to
the
situation
to
meet
these
requirements
materials
and
tasks
must
be
adapted
the
open
educational
resource
oer
textbook
“computational
thinking
with
the
bbc
microbit”
was
developed
for
the
introduction
of
computational
thinking
ct
for
10-14-year-old
pupils
in
austrias
secondary
schools
example
tasks
in
the
textbook
are
designed
with
an
open
end
and
present
extensions
with
ideas
for
further
development
instead
of
ending
abruptly
this
article
provides
a
guideline
for
a
clear
distinction
in
redesigning
existing
lessons
following
the
inverted
classroom
model
icm
using
videos
for
pre-class
work
and
live
task
extensions
for
in-class
work
which
parts
in
the
learning
design
must
remain
as
live
lessons
and
which
parts
can
be
adapted
for
video
lessons
the
respective
research
shows
that
examples
that
have
a
makerspace
activity
as
an
extension
are
especially
helpful
for
an
efficient
determination
of
the
appropriate
part
in
the
learning
design
and
particularly
suitable
for
an
adaptation
with
icm
the
central
advantage
of
the
icm
is
that
it
responds
flexibly
to
the
individual
learning
needs
of
each
student
it
allows
students
to
take
their
time
reviewing
the
material
at
their
own
pace
without
getting
left
behind
the
textbook
used
here
encourages
pupils
to
find
their
own
solutions
by
explorative
learning
using
the
block-based
programming
environment
makecode
additional
information
to
be
uncovered
by
the
learner
is
provided
for
every
single
step
in
the
accompanying
online
wiki

results
from
observations
showed
that
this
uncover-function
being
a
central
element
of
the
online
material
encouraged
the
learners
to
explore
their
own
way
in
finding
a
solution
with
playful
elements
and
increased
motivation
the
many
haptic
elements
of
a
makerspace
activity
are
in
particular
useful
for
consolidation
of
the
learned
and
are
predisposed
for
in-class
work

were
trained
on
how
to
use
the
“flip-version”
of
an

and
asked
to
develop
a

the
didactic
approach
to
redesigning
the
material
and
teacher
training
was
evaluated
during
the
first
cycle
of
dbr
results
from
expert

showed
that
the

deliver
a
solid
ground

we
found
that

the
development
of
computational

through
visual

using
resources
such

has
been
used
frequently
in

presents
practical
suggestions
for
using

the
suggestions
are
the
result
of
the
experience
developed
in
a
school
of
the
public

of
cascavelpr
whose
results
show
that
this
integration
promotes
interest
in
the
content
and
commitment
of
the
students
making
learning
meaningful
while
block-based
programming
has
successfully
eliminated
critical
syntactic
barriers
to
programming
it
remains
unclear
how
effectively
it
aids
in
overcoming
semantic
logical
and
pragmatic
programming
challenges
that
hinder
computational
thinking
these
challenges
are
likely
to
far
outweigh
the
syntactic
ones
with
the
goal
of
creating
a
highly
accessible
programming
tool
for
young
students
using
mobile
devices
we
explored
the
concept
of
pragmatic
prebugging
to
begin
addressing
these
challenges
by
pragmatic
prebugging
we
refer
to
proactive
debugging
tools
designed

as
a
computational

the
pair
computational
problem-solving
between
the

was
analyzed
the
three
university
students
who
were
experienced
in
using
python
program
in
computational
problem-solving
participated
in
the
study
in
data
collection
a
problem
involving
“limit

sequence”
from

was
used
to
examine
students
collaboration
with
chatgpt
students
were
asked
to
construct
a
program
that
produces
a
solution
to
this
problem
in
python
and
meanwhile
it
was
stated
that
they
could
work
in
pairs
with
chatgpt
the
responses
provided
by
chatgpt
to
the
students
in
the
computational
problem-solving
were
evaluated
in
both
computational
and
mathematical
contexts
and
a
list
of
cases
in
which
chatgpt
could
and
could
not
support
students
in
the
computational
thinking
practices
was
created
aside
from
the
incorrect
or
implicit
answers
provided
by
chatgpt
in
general
it
was
determined
that
chatgpt
supported
the
students
performance
in
computational
thinking
it
was
deduced
that
it
was
important
for
the
student
to
make
a
rational
problem-solving
plan
and
to
guide
the
chatgpt
with
the
appropriate
prompts
in

have
to
parse

is
essential
for
the
understanding

in
this
paper
we
analyze
how
to
introduce
online
adaptive
formative
learning
in
computer
science
a
discipline
with
well
documented
challenges
that
are
hard
to
tackle
with
traditional
classroom
methods
specifically
we
developed
illustrative
learning
items
teaching
model-driven
design
and
implemented
them
in
an
online
system
that
implements
a
model
for
automatic
formative
assessment
developed
by
university
of
torino
the
model
takes
advantage
of
an
automatic
assessment
system
initially
designed
for
stem
disciplines
then
adopted
for
teaching
languages
and
other
disciplines
too
the
key
features
of
the
adaptive
model
supported
by
the
online
system
are
algorithmic
questions
availability
contextualization
immediate
feedback
interactive
feedback
and
open
answers
these
features
are
portable
across
subject
domains
so
the
system
can
be
adapted
to
include
new
subjects
we
chose
mdd
because
it
is
a
topic
of
computer
science
education
connected
with
computational
thinking
software
design
and
formal
methods
which
are
three
of
the
core
areas
in
need
of
enhanced
support
introduction
to
programming
is
a
traditional
and
compulsory
course
for
first
year
computer
science
students
however
research
in
the
field
of
computer
science
education
has
highlighted
that
many
students
lack
on
problem_solving
and
computational
thinking
skills
these
issues
provoke
questions
in
the
academic
community
as
to
whether
the
learning
methodology
of
introductory
to
programming
courses
is
appropriate
as
regards
the
pedagogical
procedure
in
general
the
teacher-centered
model
was
amended
with
the
introduction
of
interactive
learning
environments
which
promote
distributed
learning
in
this
paper
we
examine
the
fundamental
skills
needed
for
introductory
to
programming
courses
additionally
we
focus
on
some
of
the
most
popular
micro

and
evaluate
them
in

this
descriptive
study
examines
how
the
student-centered
approach
can
be
utilized
as
supportive
classroom
climate
and
how
it
can
be
combined
with
cooperative
team
tasks
for
solving
computational

problems
using
an
easy
accessible
computer-coding
environment
drawing
on
existing
concepts
and

methods
this
study
applies
a
case

approach
with
mixed_methods
to
investigate
students
development
of
team-attitudes
and
characteristics
of
team
cooperation
it
turned
out
that
students
identified
the
quality
of
cooperation
in
their
teams
as
beneficial
and
productive
while
from
an
outside
point
of
view
their
teamwork
seemed
to
be
unorganized
and
not
cooperative
these
contradicting
results
were
clarified
in
a
classroom
meeting
where
it
became
clear
that
the
student-centered
classroom
climate
still
could
have
influenced
students
team
attitudes
in
a
way
that
students
felt
comfortable
to
express
themselves
in
their
sometimes
not
so
nice
youth
language
during
problem_solving
tasks
but
while

effectively
we
describe

the
main
challenge
is
getting

is
a
current

we
discovered
that
not
all

approximately
one
half
of
the
questioned

hold
a
negative
attitude
towards
the

they
would
rather
continue
teaching
computer

their
attitude
proves
to
be
an
impediment
to
a
successful
curricular
change
as
teachers
should
fully
grasp
the

the
fundamental
concept
behind
bayes’
theorem
revolves
around
comprehending
the
degree
of
truth
within
the
confines
of
an
explicit
perspective
this
involves
partitioning
the
entire
sample

of
possible

and
utilizing
the
subset
containing
the
relevant
perspective
to
estimate
the
uncertainty
of
an
event
or
the
reliability
of
a
model
however
it
is
often
found
difficult
for
students
to
understand
bayes’
theorem
to
the
level
of
applying
it
to
real-world

this

paper
introduces
an
innovative
approach
that
uses
computational

in
a
mechanical
engineering
undergraduate
course
to
aid
the
understanding
of
complex

and
enhance
students
computational
thinking
skills
research
indicates
that
students
irrespective
of
their
educational
level
face
difficulties
in
grasping
fundamental
concepts
in
mechanics
of
materials
these
challenges
arise
from
the
inherent
complexity
of
concepts
like
stress
strain
torsion
and
buckling
which
are
difficult
to
observe
hindering
comprehension
therefore
this
work
aims
to
leverage
the
synergy
between
mechanics
of
materials
and
computational
principles
to
actively
engage
students
in
advanced
topics
such
as
structural
strength
failure
of
structures
and
sensitivity
analysis
through
the
use
of
computational
notebooks
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
this
approach
we
first
asked
students
to
analyze
truss
structures
using
hand
calculations
following
the
discrete
stiffness
method
within
a
finite
element
analysis
framework
subsequently
we
implemented
the
same
method
as
a
simulation
tool
in
a
matlab
computational
notebook
finally
we
asked
the
students
to
reflect
on
1
the
value
of
using
computational
methods
to
approach
finite
element
analysis
when
compared
to
hand
calculations
2
the
difficulties
they
faced
when
implementing
the
activities
in
the
matlab
computational
notebook
3
the
support
they
required
to
successfully
complete
these
activities
and
4
the
effectiveness
of
the
simulation
tool
in
understanding
the
effect
of
forces
and
stress
distributions
in
structures
we
anticipate
that
computational
notebooks
will
provide
an
ideal
platform
for
sharing
lessons
and
tutorials
enhancing
student
engagement
and
promoting
active
learning
students
have
access
to
the
complete

them
to
develop

data
mining
approaches
have
proven
to
be
successful
in
improving
learners’
interaction
with
educational
computer
games
despite
the
potential
of
predictive
modelling
in
providing
timely
adaptive
learning
and
gameplay
experience
there
is
a
lack
of
research
on
the
early
prediction
of
learners’
performance
in
educational
games
in
this
research
we
propose
an
early
predictive
modelling
approach
called
gameepm
to
estimate
learners’
final
scores
in
an
educational
game
for
promoting
computational
thinking
specifically
the
gameepm
approach
models
the
sequence
of
learners’
actions
and
then
uses
a
limited
sequence
of
the
actions
to
predict
the
final
score
of
the
game
for
each
learner
the
findings
from
our
initial
trials
show
that
our
approach
can
accurately
and
robustly
estimate
the
learners’
performance
at
the
early
stages
of
the
game
using
less
than
50
of
learners’
action
sequences
the
cross-validated
deep
learning
model
achieves
a
squared
correlation
higher
than
08
with
a
relative
error
of
less
than
8
outperforming
a
range
of
regression
models
like
linear
regression
random
forest
neural
networks
and
support
vector
machines
an
additional
experiment
showed
that
the
validated
deep
learning
model
can
also
achieve
high
performance
while
tested
on
an
independent
game
dataset
showing
its
applicability
and
robustness
in
real-world
cases
comparing
the
results
with
traditional
machine
learning
methods
revealed
that
in
the
validation
and
application
phases
up
to
030
and
035
r2
gain
is
achieved
in
favor
of
the
deep
learning
model
respectively
finally
we
found
that
while
the
lengths
of
action
sequences
influence
the
predictive
power
of
the
traditional
machine
learning
methods
this
effect
is
not
substantial
in

this
work
presents
the
results
of
a
research
that
aimed
to
evaluate
the
use
of
the
scratch
visual
programming
language
in
the
development
of
computational
thinking
in
comparison
with
the
use
of
pseudocode
during
the
teaching
of
logic
and
programming
algorithms
the
research
was
delineated
with
a
methodology
of
action
research
which
made
possible
the
evaluation
of
the
scratch
language
and
the
pseudocode
at
the
end
of
the
approach
of
each
content
the
steps
of
approaching
each
content
were
initiated
with
the
application
of
the
diagnostic
evaluation
and
finalized
with
the
evaluation
of
performance
the
results
indicate
that
the
use
of
the
scratch
language
presented
better
results
during
the
initial
stages
as
the
complexity
of
the
content
increased
the
use
of
the
pseudocode
produced
better
results
nevertheless
it
is
worth
noting
the
good
acceptance
of
the
scratch
language
for
the
teaching-learning
process
of
the
contents
as
well
as
the
contribution
that
it
has
had
to
the
learning
of
logic
and
programming
algorithms
the
objective
of
this
study
is
to
determine
if
there
exists
a
statistically
significant
distinction
between
high_school
pupils
who
get
instruction
in
the
topic
of
“art”
through
the
use
of
artificial

ai
and
those
who
receive
instruction
through
the

steam
creativity
particularly
within
the
realm
of
art
and
design
is
commonly
perceived
as
the
ability
to
think
beyond
conventional
boundaries
the
study
posited
an
alternative
perspective
by
equating
computational
thinking
with
creative
thinking
a
total
of
forty-two
kids
from
a
high_school
in
kazakhstan
were
chosen
as
case

is
to
facilitate
the
integration
of

teachers
face
challenges
in
teaching

the
difficulties
vary
from

teachers
first
challenge
in
computer

cs
and
computational

teaching
is
their
technological

challenges
lack
of
confidence
time
and
willingness
are
significant
reasons
for
the
challenge
one
of
the
studies
on
mathematics
teaching
shows
that
teachers
need
more
knowledge
tools
and
models
to
facilitate
the
analysis
during
the
teaching
process
researchers
assert
that
educational
practice
has
focused
more
on
technology
than
on
new
pedagogies
needed
to
truly
use
technology
in
a
transformative
way
frameworks
are
designed
to
meet
high-level
objectives
set
by
the
authorities
teachers
are
provided
with
teaching
materials
for
developing
the
course
contents
the
frameworks
act
as
a
connection
between
high-level
objectives
and
low-level
teaching
materials
in
this
paper
we
present
the
elaboration
of
a
framework
for
teaching
cs
at
the
early
stages
of
education
the
framework
consists
of
three
components
based
on
modelling
real-world
problems
into
a
machine-world
context
and
then
realising
the
machine
solution
in
the
real
world
moreover
the
problem-solving
component
of
the
framework
emphasizes
the
iterative
process
of
learning
that
strengthens
the
previous
concepts
and
provides
a
logical
con-nection
between
the
previous
and
new
concepts
the
framework
was
evaluated
in
the
context
of
saudi
arabia
where
the
teachers
were
interviewed
individually
and
then
provided
with
a
guide
for
teaching
grade-4
learners
the
guide
was
developed
using
the
material
provided
by
the
saudi
ministry
of
education
the
teachers
taught
using
this
guide
over
a
sequence
of
lessons
at
the
end
of
this
time
a
second
individual
teacher
interview
was
conducted
to
determine
teacher
experience
the
results
show
that
teaching
using
the
framework
is
effective
and
it
is
not
only
easier
for
teachers
to
understand
the
teaching
method
but
also
for
learners
to
learn
the
content

there
is
a
need

addresses
the
need
to
create
tools
that
effectively
support
the
learning
of
programming
and
the
development
of
computational

fea
course
for
undergraduate
mechanical
engineering
students
our
previous
work
has
shown
that
students
often
face
difficulties
in
grasping
abstract
concepts
from
mechanics
of
materials
while
simultaneously
learning
computational
modeling
however
students
recognized
several
advantages
of
using
matlab
for
fea
compared
to
manual
calculations
including
significant
time
savings
increased
efficiency
and
reduced
errors
nevertheless
they
also
faced
challenges
including
a
steep
learning
curve
for
matlab
and
concerns
about
how
this
limitation
hinders
their
conceptual
understanding
despite
these
drawbacks
they
recognized
the
importance
and
value
of
developing
computational
skills
for
their
future
careers
in
this
study
we
extended
the
scaffolds
and
changed
the
sequence
of
activities
to
address
the
challenges
the
students
faced
in
the
previous
iteration
of
our
work
specifically
we
provided
worked
examples
that
students
needed
to
use
self-explain
and
modify
before
they
engaged
in
programming
from
scratch
also
after
developing
a
basic
understanding
of
how
to
implement
fea
in
matlab
the
students
used
chatgpt
to
generate
a
code
that
would
do
the
same
task
this
activity
required
them
to
evaluate
and
refine
automatically
generated
matlab
code
as
chatgpt
may
provide
alternative
solutions
that
might
not
always
work
correctly
we
explore
three
main
topics
to
understand
student
experiences
with
and
perceptions
of
this
approach
1
the
value
of
using
computational
methods
compared
to
manual
completion
for
fea
2
the
challenges
and
support
of
using
matlab
for
fea
and
3
the
effectiveness
of
simulation
tools
to
learn
fea
the
goal
of
this
project
is
two-fold
1
supporting
student
learning
of
intricate
phenomena
explored
in
mechanics
of
materials
like
distribution
of
stress
and
stiffness
and
2
fostering
essential
computational
thinking
skills
through
practical
disciplinary
coding
experience
by
implementing
these
elements
the
study
anticipates
a
substantial
improvement
in
students
understanding
of
fea
principles
and
their
ability
to
translate
them
into
solutions
for
real-world
engineering
challenges
teaching
autonomous
and
intelligent
transportation
systems
in
higher_education
has
traditionally
focused
on
theory
often
lacking
comprehensive
coverage
of
the
practical
techniques
required
for
real-world
applications
to
overcome
this
we
developed
a
new
university
course
centered
around
hands-on
learning
with
a
modular
autonomous
small-scale
vehicle
platform
called
f1tenth
this
paper
presents
a
detailed
overview
of
the
new
course
design
its
underlying
philosophy
the
individual
teaching
modules
and
the
modular
hardwaresoftware
of
the
f1tenth
platform
this
new
course
was
then
evaluated
with
a
survey
conducted
at
five
universities
that
have
adopted
the
teaching
modules
for
their
semester-long
undergraduate
and
graduate
courses
the
results
show
that
approximately
80
of
all
involved
students
strongly
agree
that
the
hardware
platform
and
modules
significantly
increased
their
motivation
to
learn
more
than
70
of
the
students
agreed
that
the
hardware
enhanced
their
understanding
of
the
material
the
findings
demonstrate
that
our
course
setup
and
the
f1tenth
hardware
effectively
combine
theoretical
knowledge
with
practical
application
greatly
enhancing
the
educational
outcomes
and

reinforced
fundamental
concepts
learned
in

while
expanding
on
design-related
analysis
which
is
often
left
for
advanced

the
lab
module
began
with
an
introduction
to

and
quickly
transitioned
to
the
parametric

students
acquired
a
working
knowledge
of
python
programming
and
experienced
how
computational
tools
can
be
used
to
solve
advanced
engineering
problems
at
the

is
important
especially
in

have
been
preparing
for
the

however
there
are
still
remaining
problems
including
the
shortage
of
trained

and
the
lack
of
good
assessment
tools
in
order
to
remedy
the
shortage
of

we
designed
some

we
included
only
the
questions
for

as
there
is
a

we
have
used

automatic
assessment
of
learner
competencies
is
a
fundamental
task
in
intelligent

systems
an
assessment
rubric
typically
and
effectively
describes
relevant

and
competence
levels
this
paper
presents
an
approach
to
deriving
a
learner
model
directly
from
an
assessment
rubric
defining
some
partial
ordering
of
competence
levels
the
model
is
based
on
bayesian
networks
and
exploits
logical
gates
with
uncertainty
often
referred
to
as
noisy
gates
to
reduce
the

so
to
simplify
their

by

and
allow
real-time

in

we
illustrate
how
the
approach
can
be
applied
to
automatize
the
human

of
an

developed
for
testing
computational

skills
the
simple
elicitation
of
the
model
starting
from
the

rubric
opens
up
the
possibility
of
quickly
automating
the
assessment
of
several

making

more
easily
exploitable
in
the

of

our
study
is
set
in
an
educational
context
to
better
teach
and
assess
21st-century
skills
such
as
computational
thinking
or
creative
problem_solving
we
propose
to
formalize
a
specific
activity
that
involves
these
competencies
this
activity
referred
to
as
creacube
is
presented
as
an
open-ended
problem
which
consists
of
assembling
a
set
of
robotic
cubes
into
an
autonomous
vehicle
we
not
only
anchor
our
formalization
in
classical
learning
science
frameworks
but
we
also
propose
to
draw
on
neuro-cognitive
models
to
describe
the
observed
behaviors
of
learners
engaged
in
this
activity
the
chosen
formalism
is
symbolic
and
is
aligned
on
upper
ontologies
to
ensure
that
the
vocabulary
is
well
specified
this
allows
for
a
better
communication
between
the
summoned
research
fields
namely
learning
science
cognitive
neuroscience
and
computational
modeling
beyond
this
specification
purpose
we
suggest
performing
inferences
using
available
reasoners
to
better
guide
the
analysis
of
the
observables
collected
during
the
experiments
this
operationalization
of
a
creative
problem-solving
activity
is
part
of
an
exploratory
research
action
in
addition
an
effective
proof
of
concept
is
described
in
this
study
understanding
computing
concepts
is
one
of
the
foundational
elements
of
computational
thinking
which
helps
students
formulate
logic
and
algorithms
for
effectively
developing
and
designing
codes
however
novice
learners
often
struggle
to
understand
basic
computing
concepts
such
as
variables
loops
arrays
conditionals
and
functions
this
is
often
caused
by
the
invisibility
of
the
computing
mechanism
and
the
complexity
of
language
syntax
and
conventions
moreover
challenges
in
learning
computing
concepts
can
be
compounded
for
learners
with
atypical
conditions
eg
visual
cognitive
and
learning
impairment
attention
deficit
and
neurodivergence
to
tackle
this
teachers
of
typical
ability
learners
frequently
use
notional
machines
nms
-
simplified
representations
eg
diagrams
flow
charts
and
analogies
created
to
assist
novice
programmers
in
understanding
abstract
concepts
program
execution
and
dynamics
in
addition
traditional
learning
activities
may
need
assistive
learning
interventions
alis
and
learner-oriented
practices
like
physical
tactile
models
computing
artifacts
and
interactive
learning
tools
nm
approaches
tend
to
focus
on
the
explanation
of
concepts
from
instructor
to
learner
while
alis
tend
to
focus
on
learner
support
in
activities
both
methods
can
provide
advantages
for
learning
and
we
expect
that
a
combined
approach
would
provide
even
greater
synergy
for
all
learners
however
little
consideration
has
been
given
to
how
nm
and
ali
approaches
could
be
effectively
combined
this
research
investigates
how
nm
and
ali
can
be
effectively
brought
together
more
holistically
as
an
inclusive

in

we
develop
the
conceptualization
of

grounded
in

and
ali

we
also
propose
a
structured

for
creating

finally
we
also
develop
a

based
on
the

scratch
has
a
lot
of
evaluation
around
it
reasonable
evaluation
can
help
programmers
understand
their
projects
better
at
the
same
time
it
can
also
provide
a
reference
for
them
to
browse
other
projects
in
the
online
community
most
of
the
existing
evaluations
on
scratch
are
carried
from
three
perspectives
computational

ct
ability
visual
presentation
aesthetics
and
code
quality
among
them
the
assessment
of
ct
and
code
quality
is
mainly
carried
out
from
the
program
script
while
the
evaluation
of
visual
aesthetics
is
analyzed
from
the
perspective
of
image
sequences
generated
by
project
execution
the
single-view
evaluation
focuses
on
the
performance
of
a
program
in
a
certain
aspect
and
is
one-sided
in
this
paper
we
propose
a
multi-view
evaluation
framework
to
integrate
various
evaluations
using
different
policies
we
quantitatively
analyze
the
assessment
of
different
views
driven
by
data
combined
with
overall
evaluations
that
represent
human
opinions
we
analyze
their
differences
and
connections
through
experiments
we
determine
the
weights
of
different
integration
policies
the
proposed
multi-view
evaluation
method
can
generate
evaluation
results
similar
to
human
opinions
in
todays
growing
digital

vulnerable
to
new

because
of
the

so
it
is
crucial
to
develop
intrusion

systems
idss
that
can
provide
the

in

no

so
new

techniques
are
required
in
this

a
novel
metaheuristic
called
the
deep

dso
is
proposed
the
deep

optimiser
mimics
the

patterns
of

to
solve

the
dso
is
modelled
on
the

is
often
modelled
on

is
employed
in
this

the
mathematical
model
of

is
employed
to
simulate

the
performance
of

is
demonstrated
by
employing
23
traditional

the

the

however
remains

to
address
this
gap
and
question
if

nevertheless
the

still
persists
this

both
of
these

were
explicitly
designed
to
support
the
learning
of

and
skills
of
computer

and
engineering
in
a
developmentally
appropriate
way
the
design
principles
are
based
on
the
notion

there
are
many

we
present
a
principled
approach
to
teach

using
a
debugging

called
gidget
which
was
created
using
a
unique

taken
together
the
results
were
very
encouraging
learners
were
able
to
program
with
conditionals
loops
and
other
programming
concepts
after
using
the
game
for
just
5
hours
we
propose
a
framework
and
a
setup
for
presenting
complex

environment
after
constructing
some
three-dimensional

uses
the

worldwide
in

but
it
disappeared
from
the
educational
landscape
in
the
early
90s
with
the
development
of
visual

such
as

this
movement
has
emerged
again
in
recent
years
as
teachers
at
all
educational
levels
and
from
different
disciplines
consider
that
the
use
of
programming
enhances
learning
in
many
subjects
and
allows
students
to
develop
important
skills
the
systematic
literature
review
presented
in

aims
to
summarize
the
results
of
recent
research
using
programming
with

in
subjects
not

to
computing
and

as
well
as
studies
analyzing
the
kind
of

develop
while

in
this
environment
although
the
analyzed
papers
provide
promising
results
regarding
the
use
of

as
an
educational

this
review
highlights
the
need
to
conduct
more
empirical
research
in
classrooms
using
larger
samples
of
students
that
allow
to
obtain
clear
conclusions
about
the
types
of

that
could
be
enhanced
through
programming
schools
universities
and
other
educational
entities
are
increasingly
aware
of
the
untapped
potential
of
digital
transformation
an
essential
process
for
increasing
efficiency
and
collaboration
and
reducing
costs
and
errors
in
the
management
of
at-scale
training
systems
in
this
context
the
“riconnessioni”
project
was
promoted
by
the
compagnia
di
san
paolo
in
agreement
with
the
ministry
of
education
but
planned
started
and
developed
by
the
foundation
for
the

the
digital
transformation
started
with
a
defined
strategy
that
leveraged
opportunities
presented
by
new
technology
while
meeting
the
objectives
of
system
stakeholders
through
several
steps
that
strategy
was
developed
for
education
connecting
everything
to
support
tomorrow’s
digital
world
and
creating
strong
strategic
partnerships
able
to
build
an
ecosystem
connecting

into
a
powerful
secure

this
paper
reports
on
the
three-year
riconnessioni
project
which
is
combining
the
energies
of
teachers
managers
administrative
staff
students
among
others
and
experimenting
with
new
learning
models
taking
advantage
of
opportunities
that
emerged
from
perceptions
stemming
from
concerns
and
systemic
issues
to
date
more
than
150
schools
in
italy
have
been
included
in
the
project
together
with
550
teachers
selected
to
scale
up
the
instructional
process
using
a
methodology
called
“cascade
training”
the
550
selected
teachers
were
able
to
spread
the
knowledge
to
more
than
2600
colleagues
the
monitoring
and
evaluation
activity
performed
in
riconnessioni
aims
at
processing
information
on
implementation
and
results
following
three
lines
first
it
regularly
evaluates
project
activities
from
a
reporting
standpoint
second
it
verifies
the
plan
consistency
against
implementation
achievements
third
it
identifies
changes
produced
and
focuses
on
teachers’
and
students’
skills
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
the
project
the
assessment
framework
is
also
discussed
in
this
work
reporting
on
results
regarding
feedback
follow-up
and
effects
gathered
from
the
field
the
evaluation
highlighted
that
labs
were
indeed
able
to
improve
teachers’
competence
and
underlined
the
added
value
of
cascade
training
which
spread
digital
domain
knowledge
and
awareness
into
the
group
of
involved
schools
despite
the
enthusiasm
and
initiatives
for
making
programming
accessible
to
students
outside
computer
science
cs
unfortunately
there
are
still
many
unanswered
questions
about
how
we
should
be
teaching
programming
to
engineers
scientists
artists
or
other
non-cs
majors
we
present
an
in-depth
case
study
of
first-year
management
engineering
students
enrolled
in
a
required
introductory
programming
course
at
a
large
north
american
university
based
on
an
inductive
analysis
of
one-on-one
interviews
surveys
and
weekly
observations
we
provide
insights
into
students
motivations
career
goals
perceptions
of
programming
and
reactions
to
the
java
and
processing
languages
one
of
our
key
findings
is
that
between
the
traditional
classification
of
non-programmers
vs
programmers
there
exists
a
category
of
conversational
programmers
who
do
not
necessarily
want
to
be
professional
programmers
or
even
end-user
programmers
but
want
to
learn
programming
so
that
they
can
speak
in
the
“programmers
language”
and
improve
their
perceived
job
marketability
in
the
software
industry
teaching
students
how
to
code
in
k-12
classrooms
is
considered
as
one
of
the
major
keys
to
promoting
engineering
education
in
the
future
which
can
potentially
enhance
the
competency
and
computational
skills
of
students
to
adhere
better
learning
outcomes
in
higher_education
the
success
of
promoting
coding
education
or
integrating
it
into
school
curriculum
depends
on
the
perceptions
of
teachers
and
headmasters
in
schools
and
how
well
they
believe
on
coding
education
and
prepare
for
the
innovative
teaching
and
learning
in
this
exploratory
research
study
it
reports
the
results
of
a
large-scale
quantitative
questionnaire
surveying
42
primary
and
secondary
schools
n
42
in
hong
kong
where
computer
programming
has
not
been
regulated
as
a
compulsory
course
in
k-12
curriculum
the
questionnaire
aims
to
investigate
the
school
belief
on
coding
education
and
their
practical
challenges
while
integrating
it
into
their
regular
school
curriculum
our
results
show
that
there
is
a
trend
in
the
local
schools
promoting
coding
education
with
positive
perceptions
on
teaching
and
learning
however
teaching
challenges
are
also
mentioned
in
the
survey
waiting
for
solutions
such
as
lack
of
teachers
training
and
unified
curriculum
therefore
the
empirical
experiences
of
these
schools
have
set
forth
the
future
research
direction
in
design
and
implementation
of
coding
education
in
k-12
classrooms
not
only
in
hong
kong
but
also
in
the
globe
interest
in
studying
computer
science
has
been
extended
to
children
however
it
is
unclear
which
educational
method
should
be
used
teachers
need
help
to
tackle
this
task
therefore
this
paper
proposes
using
metaphors
such
as
recipeprogram

sequence
pantrymemory
and

it
also
illustrates
the
possibility
of
applying

with
a
discussion
on

insights
for
supporting
middle-schoolers
in
becoming

in
the

the
abstract
nature
of
programming
makes
learning
to
code
a
daunting
undertaking
for
many
novice

in
this
work
we
advocate
the
use
of
comics—a
medium
capable
of
presenting
abstract
ideas
in
a
concrete
familiar
way—for
introducing
programming
concepts
particularly
we
propose
a

to
help
students
and
teachers
create
coding
strips
a
form
of
comic
strips
that
are
associated
with
a

we
conducted
two
design
workshops
with
students
and
high_school
computer
science
teachers
to
evaluate
our
design
process
and
tools
we
find
that
our
design
process
and
tools
are
effective
at
supporting
the
design
of
coding
strips
and
that
both
students
and
teachers
are
excited
about
using

game-based_learning

presents
evidence
that
a
collaborative

approach
can
effectively
address
this
problem
at
the
middle

level
in
an
iterative

study
to
measure
its
effectiveness
at
supporting
all

of
the
intervention
male

outpaced
female

caught
up

with
developing
mini-games
the
most
important
change
for
the
second
cycle
is
to
significantly
extend
the
time
allocated
for
game
development
this
seems
justified
due
to
the
vast
spectrum
of
skills
and
competences
students
tend
to
acquire
when
collaborating
on
complex
and
exciting
issues
like
developing
games
this
study
reports
the
use
of
a
physical
robot
and
robot
simulator
in
an
introductory
programming
course
in
a
university
and
measures
students
programming
background
conceptual
learning
gain
and
learning
experience
one
group
used
physical
robots
in
their
lessons
to
complete
programming
assignments
while
the
other
group
used
robot
simulators
we
are
interested
in
finding
out
if
there
is
any
difference
in
the
learning
gain
and
experiences
between
those
that
use
physical
robots
as
compared
to
robot
simulators
our
results
suggest
that
there
is
no
significant
difference
in
terms
of
students
learning
between
the
two
approaches
however
the
control
group
that
uses
the
physical
robot
shows
a
more
positive
response
in
their
attitudes
towards
computing
we
discuss
the
implications
of
our
findings
in
relation
to
engaging
students
and
challenges
in
using
physical
robots
from
the
learner
perspectives
and
ways
to
alleviate
this
finally
by
considering
the
insights
from
students
comments
we
also
suggest
an
alternative
that
may
give
both
benefits
of
using
both
physical
robots
and
robot
simulators
in
this
paper
we
propose
that
the
data
generated
by
educational
robots
can
be
better
used
by
applying
learning
analytics
methods
and
techniques
which
can
lead
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
learners
apprehension
and
behavior
as
well
as
refined
guidelines
for
roboticists
and
improved
interventions
by
the
teachers
as
a
step
towards
this
we
put
forward
analyzing
behavior
and
task
performance
at
team
andor
individual
levels
by
coupling
robot
data
with
the
data
from
conventional
methods
of
assessment
through
quizzes
classifying
learnersteams
in
the
behavioral
feature
space
with
respect
to
the
task
performance
gives
insight
into
the
behavior
patterns
relevant
for
high
performance
which
could
be
backed
by
feature
ranking
as
a
use
case
we
present
an
open-ended
learning
activity
using
tangible
haptic-enabled
cellulo
robots
in
a
classroom-level
setting
the
pilot
study
spanning
over
approximately
an
hour
is
conducted
with
25
children
in
teams
of
two
that
are
aged
between
11-12
a
linear
separation
is
observed
between
the
high
and
low
performing
teams
where
two
of
the
behavioral
features
namely
number
of
distinct
attempts
and
the
visits
to
the
destination
are
found
to
be
important
although
the
pilot
study
in
its
current
form
has
limitations
eg
its
low
sample
size
it
contributes
to
highlighting
the
potential
of
the
use
of
learning
analytics
in
educational
robotics
as
metaphorical
representations
showed
beneficial
effects
on
several
parts
of

this
paper
focuses
on
the
question
how
can
metaphorical
representations
in
vr
enhance
the
understanding
of
theoretical
computer
science
concepts
a
concept
for
an

to
immerse
students
in
a
world
of
islands
states
with
treasure
islands
final
states
each
symbol
from
the
input
alphabet
is
illustrated
through
another
boat
on

students
navigate
through
the

by
looking
at
one
of
the

on
the
current
island
using
a

they
then
take
the

route
of
the
selected

by
pressing
a

the
goal
of
the

can
either
be
to
reach

and
open
the
treasure
chest
or
to
complete
the
map
game-based_learning
environments
can
deliver
robust
learning
gains
and
also
have
a
unique
capacity
to
engage
students
yet
they
can
unintentionally
disadvantage
students
with
less
prior
gaming
experience
this
is
especially
concerning
in
computer
science
education
as
certain
underrepresented
groups
such
as
female
students
may
on
average
have
less
prior
experience
with
games
this
paper
presents
evidence
that
a
collaborative
gameplay
approach
can
successfully
address
this
problem
at
the
middle
school
level
in
an
iterative
designed-based
research
study
we
first
used
an
experimental
pilot
study
to
investigate
the
nature
of
collaboration
in
the
engage
game-based_learning
environment
and
then
deployed
engage
in
a
full
classroom
study
to
measure
its
effectiveness
at
serving
all
students
in
earlier
phases
of
the
intervention
male
students
outpaced
their
female
peers
in
learning
gains
however
female
students
caught
up
during
a
multi-week
classroom
implementation
these
findings
provide
evidence
that
a
collaborative
gameplay
approach
may
over
time
compensate
for
gender
differences
in
experience
and
lead
to
equitable
learning
experiences
within

948
players
of

we
explore
how

we
find
that
no

makes
significantly
better

than

and
that
their

robotic

is
integrated
or
being
integrated
into
the
education
system
for
children
at
an
early
age
all
around
the
world
most
of
the
teachers
in
charge
of
this
education
lack
skills
and
are
left
to
fend
for
themselves
this
study
proposes
to
focus
on
the
discourses
made
by
teachers
and
learners
during
such
activities
and
especially
the
metaphors
used
spontaneously
it
takes
shape
through
two
robotic

activities
the
first
activity
involved
the
robots
bee_bot
bluebot
and
ozobot
in
seven
classes
of
children
from
3
to
10
years
old
the
second
activity
consisted
of
a
five
half-days
training
for
13
participants
from
8
to
15
years
old
they
designed
built
and
programmed

young
peoples

are
observed
to
contribute
to

development
of

for
critical
technology
education
analyses
are
carried
out
using
the
conceptual
metaphor
theory
of
lakoff
and
jonhson
three
roles
are
identified
the
metaphor
that
helps
to
understand
the
metaphor
that
makes
tangible
and
the
metaphor
that
serves
as
a
catchphrase
a
metaphor
can
take
more
than
one
role
and
whatever
its
role
can
be
classified
as
a
living
or
non-living
metaphor
using
living
metaphors
may
hide
aspects
of
the
machine
and
raises
ethical
issues
inter
alia
it
is
then
essential
to
deconstruct
young
peoples
representations
of
the
machine
this
can
be
achieved
by
analyzing
robots
as
social
constructions
that

and
has
a

the

cs
is
an
often
misunderstood
field
due
to
lack
of
exposure
and
knowledge
this
paper
explores
the
misperception
associated
with
computer

and
examines
the
efforts
to
make
it
more
inclusive
by
attracting

we
present
our

allowed
pupils
to
understand
the
main

to
convince
themselves
that

and
to

the
mystery

pupils
were
able
to
recognize

we
started
with

to
investigate
the
influence
of
robots
on
the
motivation
of
programming
beginners
from
the
perspective
of
the

in
particular
significant

inventory
could
be
demonstrated
the
generalization
of
the

results
is
limited
due
to
the
small

is
essential
to
confirm

inherit
currently
there
are
incredible
and
inexpensive

show
the
benefit
of
utilizing

ii
delivers
an
entertaining

shows
results
that
could
help
to
avoid
some
challenges
faced
by
those
who
seek
to
learn
how
to
program
to
help
improve
learning
educators
need
a
deep
understanding
of
the
obstacles
students
must
overcome
otherwise
teaching
strategies
will
be
uncertain
moreover
a
shallow
understanding
of
topics
learned
in
introductory
programming
courses
can
negatively
influence
the
learning
of
future
topics
with
the
above
motivation
we
conducted
16
semi-structured
interviews
with
instructors
who
teach
introductory
programming
courses
and
we
also
collected
diaries
kept
by
110
students
during
their
studies
the
qualitative
analysis
of
these
data
revealed
connections
between
the
studied
contents
such
as
dependencies
our
analysis
shows
that
many
difficulties
arise
from
the
incorrect
application
of
the
knowledge
necessary
in
learning
new
content
usually
because
the
student
has
not
learned
earlier
topics
or
learned
them
superficially
the
main
contribution
of
this
paper
is
a
theory
that
describes
the
connections
among
topics
of
learning
how
to
program
showing
the
influence
that
knowledge
about
one
can
have
on
others
coding

have
become
the
new
language
of

is
a
complex
task
for
the

the
investigation
of
this
problem
was
carried
out
with
the
intention
of
knowing
if
there
are
tools
that
could
help
the
student
understand
programming
by
using
augmented

technology
for
this

was
carried
out
to

debugging
code
is
a
central
skill
in
learning
to
program
nevertheless
debugging
poses
a
major
hurdle
in
the
k12
classroom
as
students
are
often
rather
helpless
and
rely
on
the
teacher
hurrying
from
one
student-pc
to
the
other
despite
this
debugging
is
an
underrepresented
topic
in
the
classroom
as
well
as
in
computer
science
education
research
as
only
few
studies
materials
and
concepts
discuss
the
explicit
teaching
of
debugging
according
to
the
constructivist
learning
theory
teaching
and
developing
concepts
and
materials
for
the
classroom
have
to
take
learners
preexisting
experience
into
account
students
preexisting
debugging
experience
is
built
through
troubleshooting
where
they
frequently
find
and
fix
errors
in
their
daily
lives
-
before
they
learn
to
program
-
for
example
when
repairing
their
bicycle
or
if
“the
internet”
stops
working
debugging
is
a
special
case
of
general
troubleshooting
and
shares
common
characteristics
such
as
the
overall
process
or
particular
strategies
thus
the
aim
of
this

is
to
develop
an
instrument
for
assessing
preexisting
debugging
experience
in
the
form
of
a
real-world
escape
room
consisting
of
debugging-related
troubleshooting
tasks
this
allows
us
to
observe
students
troubleshooting
process
strategies
and
overall
behavior
in
a
natural
environment
and
thus
assess
preexisting
debugging
experience
to
this
end
a
design-based
research
process
was
conducted
and
a
real-world
escape

consisting
of
various

the
findings
revealed
limited
proficiency
among
pre-service
mathematics
teachers
in
utilizing
scratch
particularly
regarding
its
integration
into
mathematics
instruction
several
factors
contribute
to
the
deficiency
in
skills
among
pre-service
mathematics
teachers
in
navigating
the
scratch
application
including
requiring
additional
time
to
grasp
the
programming
language
employed
in
the
application
challenges
in
arranging

to
achieve
desired
outputs
and
struggles
in
rectifying
syntax
errors
however
there
was
a
positive
attitude
towards
the
application
indicating
a
strong
inclination
to
enhance
their
skills
the
study
also
found
no
significant
differences
in
demographic
variables
such
as
gender
study
year
or
academic
achievement
but
a
slight
correlation
exists
between
knowledge
attitudes
and
academic
achievement
investigating
pre-service
teachers
readiness
to
integrate
scratch
into
mathematics
instruction
sheds
light
into
the
intersection
between
mathematics
pedagogy
and
computational

this
intersection
underscores
the
importance
of
integrating
programming
tools
like
scratch
into

education
to
cultivate
computational
thinking
skills
additionally
the
findings
contribute
to
the
broader
discourse
on
the
role
of

and
highlight
the
need
for
enhanced
training
and

one
of
the
approaches
that
is
efficient
in

tools
can
be
a
limiting
factor
for

non-malleable
codes
introduced
by
dziembowski
et
al
encode
messages
s
in
a
manner
so
that
tampering
the
codeword
causes
the
decoder
to
either
output
s
or
a
message
that
is
independent
of
s
while
this
is
an
impossible
goal
to
achieve
against
unrestricted
tampering
functions
rather
surprisingly
non-malleable
coding
becomes
possible
against
every
fixed
family
p
of
tampering

that
is
not
too
large
for
instance
when
i≤i
22αn
for
some
α

where
n
is
the
number
of
bits
in
a
codeword
in
this
paper
we
study
the
capacity
of
non-malleable
codes
and
establish
optimal
bounds
on
the
achievable
rate
as
a
function
of
the

answering
an
open

from

specifically
we
prove
that
for

p
with

i≤i
22αn
there
exist
non-malleable
codes
against
p
with
rate
arbitrarily
close
to
1-α
this
is
achieved
with
high
probability
whp
by
a
randomized
construction
we
show
the
existence
of
families
of

expno12αn
against
which
there
is
no
non-malleable
code
of

1

in
fact
this
is
the
case
whp
for
a
random
family
of
this

we
also
show
that
1
-
α
is
the
best
achievable
rate
for
the
family
of
functions
which
are
only
allowed
to
tamper
the
first
αn
bits
of
the
codeword
which
is
of
special
interest
as
a
corollary
this
implies
that
the
capacity
of
non-malleable

in
the
split-state
model
where
the

acts
independently

arbitrarily
on

circuits
many
block-based
programming
environments
have
proven
to
be
effective
at
engaging
novices
in
learning
programming
however
most
restrict
access
to
the
outside
world
limiting
learners
to
commands
and
computing
resources
built
in
to
the
environment
some
allow
learners
to
drag
and
drop
files
connect
to
sensors
and
robots
locally
or
issue
http
requests
but
in
a
world
where
most
of
the
applications
in
our
daily
lives
are
distributed
ie
their
functionality
depends
on
communicating
with
other
programs
or
accessing
resources
and
data
on
the
internet
the
lack
of
support
for
beginners
to
envision
and
create
such
distributed
programs
is
a
lost
opportunity
this
paper
argues
that
it
is
not
only
feasible
but
crucial
to
create
environments
with
simple
yet
powerful
abstractions
that
open
up
distributed
computing
and
other
widely
used
but
advanced
computing
concepts
including
networking
the
internet
of

and
cybersecurity
to
novices
by
thus
removing
the
walls
around
our
environments
we
can
expand
opportunities
for
learning
considerably
programs
can
access
a
wealth
of
online
data
and
web
services
and
communicate
with
other
projects
moreover
these
changes
can
enable
young
learners
to
collaborate
with
each
other
during
program
construction
whether
they
share
their
physical
location
or
study
remotely
importantly
providing
access
to
the
wider
world
will
also
help
counter
widespread
student
perceptions
that
block-based
environments
are
mere
toys
and
show
that
they
are
capable
of
creating
compelling
applications
the
paper
presents
netsblox
a
programming
environment
that
supports
these
ideas
and
shows
that
tools
can
be
designed
to
democratize
access
to
powerful
ideas
in
computing
nowadays
with
the

of

serious
the

for

becomes
higher
than

a

have
been
launched
for
the

which
can
detect
the

when
an

it

then
the

large

have
been
employed
significantly
in

of

nevertheless
these
models
have
been
focused
on
essential
adherence
to
their
integration
as
coding
assistants
in

however
attention
has
been
switched
to
thoroughly
examining
and
analyzing
llm
behavior
particularly
in
computing
education
for
programming
tasks
such
as
code
generation
code

and
programming
error

therefore
it
becomes
imperative
to
understand
their
behavior
to
examine
potential

this

addresses
this
gap
systematically
and

how
different

such
as
chatgpt
codex
copilot
and
others
react
to
various
coding
inputs
within

to
achieve
this
objective
we
collected
and
analyzed
articles
from
2021
to
2024
and
72
studies
were
thoroughly
examined
these

include

the
existing

and
challenges
associated
with
utilizing
these

for
coding

assessing
their
responses
to
prompts
containing

examining
the
impact
of
their
output
on
student
learning
and
evaluating
their
performance
as
debugging

the
findings
of
this
review
highlight
that
it
is
premature
to
incorporate
these
systems
into
computing
education
due
to
their
limitations
that
may
limit
their
effectiveness
as
comprehensive
coding

include
issues
with

our

for
postdoctoral
researchers
pdrs
in
the
biosciences
the
use
of
computing
software
has
become
ubiquitous
and
a
working
knowledge
of
data
science
has
become
increasingly
essential
for
researchers
in
all
domains
however
curriculum
development
focusing
on
imparting
foundational
programming
skills
and
fundamentals
of
data
science
for
researchers
in
domains
other
than
computing
has
been
scarce
thus
there
is
an
unmet
need
for
curriculum
development
involving
computational
thinking
programming
and
the
fundamentals
of
data
science
for
this
audience
recognizing
these
growing
needs
and
demands
of
researchers
to
learn
programming
and
data
science
that
can
then
be
applied
to
their
area
of
research
or
practice
we
developed
an
introductory
course
in
programming
and
data
science
for
pdrs
in
biology
and
medicine
the
primary
goal
of
the
course
was
to
develop
computational
thinking
skills
in
pdrs
who
hail
from
backgrounds
that
have
traditionally
not
focused
on
inculcating
computational
thinking
this
course
covered
the
fundamental
concepts
of
programming
using
either
python
or
r
-
languages
that
researchers
outside
the
computing
community
use
in
numerous
ways
including
the
statistical
analysis
of
large
datasets
that
are
becoming
increasingly
common
in
biomedical
research
further
pdrs
enrolled
in
the
course
were
introduced
to
some
of
the
broad
categories
of
problems
in
data
science
-
exploratory
data
analysis
classification
regression
and
clustering
-
along
with
relevant
algorithms
and
how
they
can
be
applied
to
real-world
datasets
in
their
respective
domains
using
packages
or
libraries
in
python
or
r
we
also
report
the
feedback
from
the
enrolled
pdrs
lessons
learned
and
recommendations
for
instructors
interested
in
designing
similar
curricula
our
course
focusing
on
computing
and
data
science
education
for
postdoctoral
scholars
from
a
non-computing
background
demonstrates
a
promising
model
for
incorporating
computing
education
in
other
areas
of
study
that
do
not
traditionally
have
a
focus
on
computing
education
as
well
as
in
continuing
education
computer
science
as
a
discipline
encompasses
the
study
and
creation
of
computational
techniques
for
problem-solving
unfortunately
much
of
the
benefit
of
these
techniques
to
engineering
students
is
lost
in
translation
in
part
due
to
the
disconnect
between
introductory
computing
courses
and
the
disciplinary
courses
that
introduce
problems
that
could
benefit
from
computational
techniques
a
considerable
body
of
literature
has
documented
the
ineffectiveness
of
traditional
programming
courses
in
transferring
usable
knowledge
to
students
specifically
where
problem-solving
skills
and
computational
thinking
are
concerned
this
paper
describes
a
transformative
change
to
the
instruction
of
introductory
computing
to
engineering
students
in
the
context
of
a
single
non-major
course
in
the
proposed
architecture
a
core
lecture
is
supplemented
with
plug-in
domain-specific
modules
and
problems
that
are
presented
in
domain-specific
recitationlaboratory
sections
the
focus
of
the
lecture
component
of
the
course
is
to
introduce
the
core
concepts
and
skills
required
for
computational
thinking
including
algorithms
and
software
engineering
techniques
the
recitationlaboratory
component
encourages
and
guides
the
application
of
these
skills
to
introductory
problems
in
engineering
the
objective
is
to
shift
the
emphasis
from
the
minutia
of
the
syntax
of
textual
programming
languages
to
computational
thinking
programming
skills
are
an
important
component
of
an
engineering
curriculum
not
only
because
they
enable
the
customization
of
software
tools
to
be
used
in
the
profession
but
also
and
perhaps
more
crucially
because
of
the
there
is
a
growing
literature
demonstrating
the
importance
of
collaboration
and
teamwork
in
the
process
of
learning
computational
thinking
and
the
foundational
aspects
of
computer
science
while
collaborative
virtual
environments
are
becoming
widespread
in
the
software
development
professional
domain
and
in
various
areas
of
advanced
learning
their
use
in
the
introductory
stages
of
learning
computing
is
still
very
limited
on
the
other
hand
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
blooming
of
attractive
programming
environments
specifically
designed
to
expose
young
students
eg
middle
school
age
to
computational
thinking
alice
is
a
very
popular
introductory
programming
environment
focused
on
programming
through
animations
and
story-telling
this
paper
introduces
a
novel
extension
of
the
alice
framework
that
enables
interaction
and
collaboration
among
students
in
the
development
of
programs
in
particular
the
new
version
of
alice
described
in
this
paper
provides
support
for
virtual
pair_programming
the
modified
version
of
alice
allows
two
students
to
remotely
share
a
virtual
world
and
interact
in
its
construction
the
system
supports
roles
assignments
to
allow
teachers
to
control
activities
and
contributions
of
the
two
students
in
the
creation
of
a
programming
project
as
the
needs
of
education
of
programming
language
increase
the
importance
of
the
learning
environment
has
been
emphasized
based
on
the
social
trends
various
web
services
for
the
education
of
programming
which
improves
the
computational
thinking
of
a
student
among
the
web
services
block-based
programming
languages
are
well
known
as
an
effective
educational
tool
for
a
primary
student
though
a
freshman
in
the
university
these
tools
are
proven
to
be
useful
tools
since
the
tools
provide
same
programming
environment
to
the
students
and
the
teachers
anytime
and
anywhere
however
the
environments
may
be
insufficient
for
learning
practical
programming
languages
such
as
cc
and
java
because
they
are
not
the
block-based
programming
languages
this
paper
introduces
a
block-based
learning
environment
for
c
programming
language
using
web
services
the
environment
fills
the
gap
between
building
computational
thinking
and
learning
the
syntax
of
the
programming
language
the
programming
environment
provides
the
equivalent
environment
to
teachers

the

both
the

and
lead
from

to
the
development
of
emerging

etc
in
this
paper
we
presented
a
method
of
approaching
in
the
school
educational
space
the
study
of
wireless
communication
technologies
between
smart

through
an

the

consisted
of
creating
a

via
a

connected
to
an

in
this
work-in-progress

we
exploited
and
investigated
a
virtual

fle
in
which
adolescents

exemplify
the

acted
as
the
primers
of
practicing

indicated
that
two

can
act
as

and
internet-based
digital

with
the
capacity
to
collect
aggregate
and
store

at
massive
scales
are
examples
of
tools
that
have
broadened
priorities
in
computing
to
include
data
science
in
response
there
has
been
growing
attention
in
research
and
practice
emphasizing
pre-college
groups
this
is
partly
because
of
the
growing
recognition-reflected
in
initiatives
like
cs4all
codeorg
bootstrap
data
science
exploring
computer
science-that
learning
experiences
before
college
are
consequential
in
sustaining
a
robust
pipeline
of
computer
scientists
and
engineers
despite
these
inroads
there
is
justifiable
concern
that
existing
efforts
might
not
fully
support
learner
development
in
the
necessary
conceptual
epistemological
and
heuristic
styles
needed
to
productively
parse
and
understand
“big
data”
this
is
because
computing-based
curricula
that
include
data
science
often
involve
data
curated
by
others
rather
than
learners
directly
which
results
in
simulated
versions
of
practice
instead
of
engagement
that
is
realistically
discursive
and
messy
this
is
further
complicated
by
the
persistent
shortage
of
k-12
computer
science
teachers
in
general
and
even
fewer
who
can
design
and
implement
curricula
that
support
authentic
engagement
with
data
science
to
address
these
issues
we
leverage
culturally
relevant
and
constructionist
perspectives
in
a
sandbox
ie
open-ended
science
where
tools
like
scratch
and
electronic
textiles
e-textiles
have
had
success
expanding
possibilities
in
computing
to
also
include
activities
where
learners
can
engage
broadly
along
varied
pursuits-and
encounter
challenges
that
spur
computational
thinking
and
problem-solving
the
literature
suggests
that
learning
activities
framed
in
this
way
encourage
knowledge
construction
practice
literacies
and
seriously
impact
learner
attitudes
interest
and
perceptions
of
growth
in
the
field
this

are
also
essential
this

will
be
discussed
in
addition
to

from
one

program
in
the
digital

programming
education
has
become
increasingly
important
even
in
primary
schools
however
introducing
programming
at
such
an
early
stage
presents
unique
challenges
given
the
need
for
students
to
grasp
mathematical
concepts
abstract
thinking
and
the
intricacies
of
programming
syntax
educational
data
mining
edm
offers
a
potential
contribution
by
predicting
learning
performance
facilitating
the
optimization
of
the
learning
processes
and
providing
real-time
guidance
a
notable
gap
in
the
current
literature
about
edm
in
programming
education
is
its
predominant
emphasis
on
the
university
level
our
research
objectives
were
to
identify
features
influencing
primary_school
students
programming
capabilities
a
more
comprehensive
dataset
was
introduced
incorporating
psychometric
data
and
highlighting
features
such
as
learning
motivation
and
attitude
computational
thinking
data
and
other
potentially
influential
variables
which
set
our
study
apart
from
previous
studies
we
found
that
the
strongest
predictor
was
academic
performance
in
information
technology
followed
by
psychometric
data
on
students
learning
attitudes
and
motivation
computational
thinking
also
emerged
as
a
significant
feature
in
predicting
programming
performance
its
worth
highlighting
that
involvement
in
extra-curricular
activities
like
olympic
mathematics
training
showed
a
significant
association
underscoring
the
importance
of
mathematical
logic
and
reasoning
in
programming
this
is
further
bolstered
by
the
evident
correlation
with
academic
performance
in
mathematics
confirming
its
pivotal
role
in
shaping
programming
abilities
interestingly
the
correlation
of
academic
performance
in
chinese
is
also
significant
indicating
that
the
language
medium
of
instruction
can
notably
influence
success

the
psychology

in
a

the
program
is
aimed
at
teaching
under-represented
immigrant
engineer
students
to
learn
how
to
program
in
the
java
programming
language
the
programming
concepts
and
the
fostered

were
implemented
in
three-hour
evening
sessions
over
15
weeks
in
which
the
students
were
encouraged
to
develop
programming
communities
while
working
on
computational
thinking
concept
strands
the
research
findings
that
we
report
are
threefold
first
we
report
on
how
we
fostered
building
programming
concepts
into
the
curriculum
into
a
set
of
activities
specifically
designed
for
an
immigrant
engineer
retraining
program
with
students
ranging
in
backgrounds
we
found
that
at
that
the
program
curriculum
must
be
flexible
enough
for
student
learning
regardless
of
the
fact
that
a
student
may
miss
sessions
second
we
report
on
how
an
effective
pedagogical
environment
which
fosters
student-centered
learning
was
promoted
so
that
the
students
could
construct
their
own
meanings
of
the
programming
concepts
third
we
report
on
implementation
strategies
unique
to
a
retraining
program
such
as
specific
environmental
constraints
as
well
as
how
sessions
were
partitioned
into
components
that
fostered
computational

our
findings
provide
unique
insights
into

research
enculturation
to
engineering
is
a
topic
of
interest
to
professional
organizations
such
as
asee
or
ieee
enculturation
can
be
understood
as
the
process
by
which
students
are
assimilated
into
the
engineering
culture
this
culture
involves
the
base
knowledge
practices
and
values
shared
by
the
community
of
practicing
engineers
both
the
culture
and
its
assimilation
are
somewhat
obscure
and
often
attributed
to
role-modeling
and
hidden
curriculum
nevertheless
undergraduate
students
are
expected
to
undergo
this
assimilation
process
and
by
the
end
of
a
five-year
program
they
behave
talk
and
do
what
engineers
do
an
approach
to
this
process
is
the
well-established
model
of
engineering
identity
this
model
of
identity
however
limits
its
scope
to
the
intrinsic
process
occurring
in
the
student
without
paying
much
attention
to
the
support
systems
expected
to
welcome
and
nurture
students
into
the
profession
enculturation
is
a
relatively
new
model
that
proposes
both
intrinsic
and
extrinsic
factors
affecting
this
assimilation
of
students
during
the
spring
of
2022
a
team
of
researchers
at
a
us
southwest
institution
applied
a
survey
to
operationalize
the
extrinsic
factors
of
a
recently
outlined
engineering
model
of
enculturation
to
understand
the
impact
of
covid
on
engineering
students
eight
likert-based
questions
were
asked
to
534
engineering
undergraduate
students
at
different
school
year
classifications
eg
sophomore
junior
or
senior
the
model
of
enculturation
tested
eight
extrinsic
factors
involving
1
engineering
design
2
teamwork
3
engineering
profession
4
ethics
5
engineering
communications
6
mathematicalphysical
modeling
7
problem-solving
and
8
algorithmiccomputational
thinking
additional
likert-based
questions
asked
students
about
the
perceived
impact
of
covid
on
their
educational
experience
the
research
questions
guiding
their
investigation
were
a
how
are
the
dimensions
of
enculturation
to
engineering
changing
across
engineering
undergraduate
classifications
and
b
how
is
enculturation
associated
with
the
covid
impact
on
students
preliminary
results
show
that
six
of
the
factors
namely
1–5
and
7
increase
by
students
school
classification
this
means
that
students
in
the
lower
years
of
their
undergraduate
program
perceive
their
enculturation
as
portrayed
by
factors
1–5
7
less
than
students
at
more
advanced
stages
of
their
program
in
terms
of
the
perceived
impact
of
covid
only
two
factors
showed
negative
correlations
with
this
perceived
impact
the
factors
were
ethics
and
algorithmiccomputational
thinking
in
other
words
the
worse
the
students
perception
of
covids
impact
on
their
educational
experience
the
less
they
endorsed
their
enculturation
in
the
impact
of
society
of
their
technical
solutions
and
their
use
of
programming
languages
while
these
results
show
encouraging
applicability
of
the
enculturation
model
it
can
only
be
considered
a
first
approach
to
a
more
fully
developed
model
the
researchers
expect
to
engage
the
fie
community
in
a
discussion
leading
to
a
more
refined
enculturation
model
the

has
undergone
a
significant
transition
from

problem-based_learning
computational

approaches
have
been
used
to

a
model
and
its
usage
to
build

studies
directing
towards

the

the

organized
in
four
domains
information

computer
programming
has
become
an
increasingly
cross-cutting
theme
and
is
no
longer
considered
just
a
specialized
subject
in
some
countries
the
inclusion
of
this
subject
in
the
curricula
of
the
basic
cycles
of
their
educational
systems
has
been
provided
for
because
it
is
recognized
that
programming
promotes
computational
thinking
which
allows
cognitive
development
of
students
in
chile
the
universidad
de
la
frontera
established
that
an
initial
programming
course
is
given
to
all
the
engineering
degrees
unfortunately
studies
have
shown
that
students
are
not
achieving
the
competencies
defined
by
the
computational
thinking
approach
this
research
paper
presents
a
flexible
and
systematic
teaching
framework
for
developing
cognitive
skills
in
programming
courses
this
framework
considers
the
use
of
a
systematic
methodology
of
teaching
programming
which
focuses
on
the
process
of
building
solutions
over
the
product
using
electronic
programmable
devices
and
sets
of
pre-defined
exercises
appropriate
to
various
domains
of
the
engineering
area
nurturing
programming
talent
early
is
crucial
in
todays
digital
world
especially
in
k-12
education
underscored
by
the
rise
of
programming
competitions
for
younger
students
however
with
limited
research
in
programming
talent
search
discovering
programming
talent
in
primary
schools
posed
a
significant
challenge
traditionally
various
test-based
talent
search
tools
have
been
utilized
for
programming
talent
identification
including
the
computer
talent
search
test
ctst
and
the
beginners_computational_thinking_test
bctt
game-based
platforms
like
codecombat
offer
an
engaging
alternative
to
overcome
this
challenge
codecombat
integrates
game-based_learning
with
programming
education
allowing
students
to
apply
their
computational
thinking
skills
in
an
enjoyable
context
for
learning
python
the
study
revealed
a
significant
correlation
between
codecombat
ctst
and
bctt
outcomes
this
highlighted
that
codecombat
emerged
as
a
valuable
platform
for
talent
search
aligning
seamlessly
with
the
objectives
of
the
test-based
tools
and
suggesting
its
effectiveness
in
boosting
programming
learning
motivation
in
primary_school
in
experience
and
education
dewey
argued
that
humankind
is
“given
to
formulating
its
beliefs
in
terms
of
either-ors
between
which
it
recognizes
no
intermediate
possibilities”
not
surprisingly
educational
computing
is
no
exception
one
such
either-or
binary
that
is
relevant
to
our
project
so
far
is
computing
vs
computational
thinking2
a
keynote
address
delivered
recently
at
a
computing
education
conference
by
the
computer
scientist
and
educator
judy
robertson
is
quite
illuminating
in
this
respect3
robertson
argued
against
a
blind
emphasis
on
computational
“thinking”
as
the
centerpiece
of
computational
literacy
focusing
only
on
creating
scratch
programs
may
lead
especially
young
learners
away
from
understanding
how
the
computer
actually
works
as
a
“machine”
childrens
drawings
of
what
is
inside
a
computer
show
that
learning
to
use
computational
abstractions
that
we
typically
introduce
in
the
k-12
levels—such
as
variables
and
loops—does
not
necessarily
help
us
understand
how
these
abstractions
are
processed
and
represented
inside
the
computer
what
gets
lost
in
our
push
to
teach
children
how
to
code
is
the
physicality
of
computing
as
a
machine
which
involves
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
the
hardware
and
software—and
many
other
forms
of
computational
abstractions
that
are
not
even
presented
to
children
as
part
of
their
experience
of
coding
or
computing
programming
and
robot
building
are
two
crucial
components
in
an
ai
curriculum
while
students
learning
goal
attainment
computational
thinking
improvement
and
autonomous
learning
improvement
are
important
dimensions
to
measure
students
learning
outcomes
in
previous
teaching
practice
virtual
simulation
platforms
are
often
used
as
teaching
aids
and
the
operational
difficulty
of
the
platforms
may
reduce
students
interest
in
learning
thus
lowering
the
learning
effect
therefore
based
on
the
5e
teaching
model
this
study
combines
gamification
elements
with
virtual
simulation
integrated
learning
to
explore
its
effects
on
the
three
dimensions
of
students
learning
goal
attainment
computational

and
autonomous

improvement
this
research
addresses
the
integration
of
machine
learning
ml
into
k-12
education
which
is
increasingly
recognized
as
essential
for
preparing
students
for
the
ai-driven
world
however
the
current
landscape
of
ml
implementation
and
its
impact
in
k-12
classrooms
remain
areas
of
active
investigation
in
recent
years
the
integration
of
ml
techniques
into
k-12
computing
education
has
become
increasingly
prevalent
reflecting
the
growing
importance
of
ai-driven
and
data-driven
approaches
across
computing
fields
this
study
addresses
the
gaps
in
understanding
how
intuition
and
agency
develop
in
the
context
of
ml
systems
within
k-12
education
while
also
examining
the
emerging
trajectories
challenges
and
opportunities
in
teaching
ml
in
k-12
education
motivated
by
the
need
to
assess
the
effectiveness
and
challenges
of
ml
integration
in
k-12
settings
this
survey-based
study
aims
to
provide
insights
into
pedagogical
approaches
tools
utilized
and
teachers
perceptions
of
ml
in
education
drawing
upon
the
importance
of
early
ml
exposure
in
developing
computational
thinking
and
fostering
data
literacy
this
study
seeks
to
address
gaps
such
as
age-appropriate
content
teacher
preparedness
and
ethical
considerations
by
systematically
reviewing
existing
research
and
surveying
educators
this
study
aims
to
offer
valuable
insights
into
effective
practices
identify
tools
available
and
highlight
areas
for
further
research
on
the
responsible
implementation
of
ml
in
k-12
settings
furthermore
this
study
emphasizes
the
importance
of
understanding
gender-based
differences
in
ml
education
it
briefly
presents
gender-based
results
obtained
from
surveys
and
data
analysis
suggesting
the
need
for
tailored
approaches
to
ml
education
that
address
potential
gender-based
barriers
and
biases
additionally
the
study
discusses
the
paradigm
shift
required
to
successfully
integrate
ml
into
k-12
computing
curricula
advocating
for
embracing
ml
as
a
fundamental
component
of
future
computing
education
ultimately
this
study
aims
to
inform
computing
educators
and
policymakers
about
the
challenges
and
opportunities
associated
with
ml
education
in
k-12
settings
laying
the
groundwork
for
fostering
ml
literacy
and
computational
thinking
skills
among
k-12
students
as
an
introductory

was
explored
in
this

indicates
that
the
aforementioned
teaching
means
if
comprehensively
applied
can
facilitate
to
cultivate
students
high-order
cognitive
competence
and
further
enhance
their
computational

scratch
environment
as
a
tool
to
teach
programming
skills
or
develop
computational

is
increasingly
common
in
all
levels
of
education
well-documented
case
studies
from
primary_school
to
university
can
be
found
however
there
are
reports
that
indicate
that
students
learning
to
program
in
this
environment
show
certain
habits
that
are
contrary
to
the
basic
programming
recommendations
in
our
work
as
instructors
with
high_school
students
we
have
detected
these
and
other
bad
practices
such
as
the
repetition
of
code
and
object
naming
on
a
regular
basis
this
paper
focuses
on
verifying
whether
these
issues
can
generally
be
found
in
the
scratch
community
by
analyzing
a
large
number
of
projects
available
on
the
scratch
community
website
to
test
this
hypothesis
we
downloaded
100
projects
and
analyzed
them
with
two
plug-ins
we
developed
to
automatically
detect
these
bad
practices
the
plug-ins
extend
the
functionality
of
the
hairball
tool
a
static
code
analyzer
for
scratch
projects
the
results
obtained
show
that
in
general
projects
in
the
repository
also
incur
in
the
investigated
malpractices
along
with
suggestions
for
future
work
some
ideas
that
might
assist
to
address
such
situations
are
proposed
in
the
conclusions
of
the
paper
robotics
and
computational

are
valuable
tools
for
developing
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem

we
currently
have
a
multitude
of
robotic
education
tools
at
our
disposal
these
tools
arise
with
the
aim
of
promoting
innovation
and
student
motivation
during
the
learning
process
robots
are
becoming
more
and
more
common
in
our
society
today
therefore
it
is
important
to
integrate
robots
into
all
levels
of
our
everyday
life
this
work
is
focused
on
presenting
raspberry
pi
as
enhancer
of
educational
robotics
the
first
step
is
presenting
robotics
as
a
tool
for
promoting
the

the
last
but
not
the
least
is
an
open
discussion
with
the
aim
of
exchanging
impressions
and
getting
feedback
from
the
attendees
robotics
and
computational

are
ideal
tools
for
developing

stem
pedagogy
a
multitude
of
educational
robotics
tools
have
emerged
in
recent
years
some
with
a
high
price
and
great
features
and
others
with
a
lower
price
and
lower
performance
there
are
also
cost-effective
options
that
allow
you
to
tailor
your
services
to
tighter
budgets
the
presence
of
robots
in
our
daily
lives
is
becoming
more
and
more
common
therefore
it
is
interesting
that
we
are
oriented
to
integrate
robots
in
the
different
levels
of
our
society
this
workshop
is
focused
on
driving
the
same
content
across
three
different
low-cost
robotic
educational
tools
the
first
one
is
scratch
interactive
stories
games
and
animations
can
be
programed
the
second
tool
is
crumble
it
is
an
easy-to-use
programmable
controller
its
programming
interface
uses
a
block_programming
language
which
eases
its
use
by
children
aged
below
14
the
last
but
not
the
least
is
arduino
arduino
is
an
open-source
electronics
platform
based
on
easy-to-use
hardware
and
software
it
is
a
platform
that
incorporates
a
simple
microcontroller
and
an
interface
development
environment
to
create
the
applications
to
be
downloaded
into
the
board
this
workshop
is
aimed
to
present
the
mentioned
platforms
as
robotic
educational
tools
for
people
as
the
first
step
to
get
into
robotics
world
throughout
this
workshop
an
initiation
to
robotics
is
developed
in
the
context
of
educational
robotics
since
the
new
curriculum
reform
was
carried
off
there
has
been
a
lot
of
research
on
teaching
mode
of
programming
in
high_school
on
the
basis
of
the
exploration
of
the
potentials
if
designing
a
teaching
mode
with
the
scratch
graphical
programming
language
this
paper
builds
a
situational
teaching
mode
of
programming
in
high_school
with
scratch
this
teaching
mode
first
design
a
programming
learning
situation
which
is
familiar
by
students
because
of
its
close
connection
to
the
students
daily
life
with
scratch
for
student
through
the
analysis
of
the
common
elements
between
the
situation
and
the
concept
of
programming
the
n
guide
students
learning
in
the
situation
and
transfer
back
to
the
traditional
programming
environmental
after
he
understand
the
content
of
concept
this
teaching
mode
can
arouse
the
students
interests
of
learning
promote
the
students
learning
transfer
ability
ultimately
this
teaching
mode
can
help
students
better
understand
algorithm
programming
and
established
their
computational
thinking
both
of
them
play
a
significant
positive
role
in
developing
students
logical_thinking
ability
and
their
ability
in
solving
practical
problem
the
sprego
spreadsheet
lego
programming
method
facilitates
the
use
of
different
educational
tools
and
environments
to
provide
better
understanding
of
spreadsheet
programming
while
developing
computational
thinking
and
algorithmic
skills
with
virtual
reality
technologies
gaining
attention
and
popularity
our
goal
was
to
investigate
and
create
a
virtual
workspace
in
which
the
students
can
find
all
the
information
and
resources
they
need
while
learning
spreadsheet
programming
computer
problem_solving
and
understanding
building
algorithms
following
on
this
principle
we
developed
a
3d
virtual
collaboration
space
to
provide
students
with
one
interface
featuring
the
information
and
resources
required
to
practice
the
sprego
method
outside
of
and
during
classes
we
have
collected
refined
and
structured
the
available
sources
and
developed
detailed
tasks
with
explanations
for
students
in
the
form
of
online
documents
our
goal
was
to
provide
an
all-in-one
environment
for
the
sprego
method
to
learn
explore
and
practice
all
its
aspects
without
leaving
the
3d
space
for
our
work
we
examined
different
applications
that
provide
virtual
3d
spaces
with
educational
support
in
mind
our
choice
was
the
maxwhere
seminar
system
based
on
its
innovative
and
effective
approach
in
the
field
nowadays
there
are
more
cars
used
on
the
road
traffic
congestion
problems
can
cause
the
economy
and
the
environment
both
directly
and
indirectly
problems
also
part
of
the
problem
of
air
pollution
the
traffic
light
management
system
in
the
current
situation
has
used
a
fixed
waiting
time
which
inability
to
be
flexible
according
to
the
traffic
at
different
times
such
as
in
rush
hour
and
other
it
is
not
efficient
enough
to
manage
traffic
with
fixed
waiting
time
the
organizers
came
up
with
the
idea
of
developing
an
intelligent
traffic
light
system
with
flexibility
according
to
the
number
of
cars
in
real-time
by
reducing
waiting
time
the
paper
was
designed
and
developed
by
implementing
the
intelligent
traffic
light
system
using
image
processing
technology
to
process
the
appropriate
waiting
time
from
each
image
frame
lazarus
and
opengl
were
used
to
program
based
on
pascal
language
the
software
has
been
developed
for
receiving
traffic
video
at
the
intersection
to
process
car
image
segmentation
of
each
frame
and
to
calculate
the
distance
of
the
length
of
the
car
in
each
route
in
addition
it
is
also
possible
to
calculate
the
appropriate
time
for
green-light
and
red-light
duration
and
corresponding
to
the
length
of
the
waiting
vehicles
in
each
route
at
the
intersection
this
investigated
software
can
be
used
to
reduce
the
waiting
time
at
the
traffic
light
intersection
by
4535
in
addition
the
intelligent
traffic
light
system
is
also
a
social
development
towards
a
smart
city
the
project
has
created
the
learning
environment
and
computational
thinking
for
society
through
the
process
of
stem
education
with
using
iot
and
artificial
intelligence
introduction
to
computing
is
a
public
course
for
the
first-year
non-major
undergraduate
students
aiming
at
training
students
for
the
abilities
in
computer
science
and
technology
with
computational
thinking
however
as
new
computer
technologies
emerge
continuously
and
rapidly
it
is
required
for
this
course
to
accommodate
more
and
more
knowledge
therefore
the
teaching
contents
are
growing
enormously
which
makes
it
very
difficult
to
cover
all
of
them
in
limited
hours
and
therefore
sets
an
obstacle
in
understanding
computing
principles
and
building
up
a
clear
and
general
picture
of
computing
especially
for
non-major
students
as
computer
science
and
technology
are
becoming
more
and
more
essential
for
various
disciplines
and
majors
it
is
urgent
for
the
education
community
to
find
out
an
effective
and
propagable
way
to
solve
this
problem
in
this
regard
we
employ
virtual
reality
technology
to
the
experiment
teaching
of
this
course
and
have
developed
18
virtual
experiments
to
support
the
whole
teaching
process
for
example
turing
machine
is
a
basic
model
for
computer
science
and
technology
however
since
it
is
not
a
real
machine
it
is
not
easy
for
the
students
to
imagine
the
working
process
of
turing
machine
and
understand
the
related
concepts
another
example
the
execution
of
an
instruction
is
very
important
to
understand
the
principles
of
computer
organization
however
as
the
information
flow
is
invisible
it
is
difficult
and
time-consuming
for
the
teachers
to
explain
how
an
instruction
is
executed
inside
a
computer
therefore
3d
modeling
and
animation
techniques
are
used
to
demonstrate
the
invisible
micro-structure
of
computers
and
human-machine
interaction
and
visualization
techniques
are
used
to
present
the
internal
process
of
information
evolution
thus
constructing
a
complete
virtual
experiment
system
of
this
course
including
demonstration
experiments
verification
experiments
and
interaction
experiments
our
virtual
experiments
have
applied
software
copyrights
and
served
more
than
12000
students
from
five
universities
of
china
since
2013
the
evaluation
demonstrates
that
the
virtual
experiments
have
produced
excellent
results
in
both
teaching
effectiveness
and
learning
efficiency
relieved
the
conflicts
between
limited
hours
and
vast
knowledge
and
helped
students
understand
and
build
up
the
knowledge
of
computing
crumble
is
an
easy-to-use
programmable
controller
its
programming
interface
uses
a
block_programming
language
that
makes
it
easy
for
children
above
10
to
use
in
addition
the
hardware
elements
associated
with
crumble
are
very
intuitive
and
easy
to
connect
for
this
reason
educational
robotics
can
be
easily
implemented
thanks
to
the
card
connectors
the
motors
and
servos
can
be
managed
by
crumble
different
sensors
such
as
the
ultrasonic
distance
sensor
infrared
distance
sensor
and
line
sensor
can
also
be
connected
in
addition
crumble
can
handle
up
to
32
rgb
red
green
and
blue
leds
light
emitter
diodes
independently
and
with
24-bit
color
resolution
robotics
and
computational
thinking
are
ideal
tools
for
developing
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem
pedagogy
today
robotics
training
tools
are
raised
with
the
aim
of
promoting
innovation
and
motivation
of
students
during
the
learning
process
robots
are
becoming
more
and
more
common
in
our
daily
lives
therefore
it
is
important
to
integrate
robots
into
all
levels
of
our
society
this
document
presents
a
workshop
that
focuses
on
two
main
objectives
the
first
is
to
make
an
event
to
promote
crumble
locally
on
the
other
hand
the
aim
of
this
event
is
to
present
a
robotic
teaching
tool
so
that
people
can
take
their
first
steps
in
the
world
of
robotics
this
workshop
is
aimed
at
those
children
and
adults
who
want
to
discover
the
possibilities
that
crumble
brings
in
the
introduction
to
robotics
an
introduction
to
crumble
in
the
context
of
educational
robotics
is
developed
throughout
this
workshop
in
this
work
in
progress
paper
we
present
an
example
of
innovative
practice
in
organizing
informal
stem
education
workshops
with
young
children
the
workshops
were
divided
into
two
learning
scenarios
unplugged
programming
and
hands-on
robot
play
unplugged
programming
encourages
understanding
of
the
core
concepts
of
programming
such
as
algorithms
and
computational
thinking
rather
than
focusing
on
the
programming
language
in
the
second
learning
scenario
pupils
were
introduced
to
two
educational
robots
used
as
a
learning
tool
-
thymio
and
codey
rocky
the
aim
of
the
second
activity
was
linking
the
programming
concept
to
a
real-world
scenario
qualitative
and
quantitative
data
were
collected
using
pre-
and
post-
questionnaires
the
pre-questionnaires
contained
questions
about
the
pupils
background
knowledge
ie
basic
concepts
of
programming
and
robotics
the
post-questionnaires
were
designed
to
evaluate
the
workshops
impact
on
the
pupils
perception
of
these
observed
concepts
and
their
overall
satisfaction
with
the
workshops
combining
unplugged_activities
with
robots
helps
bridging
the
gap
between
imagination
and
reality
therefore
improving
learning
we
present
a
block-based
language
for
specifying
feedback
to
novice
learners
about
the
programs
they
are
constructing
in
a
block-based
programming
language
in
addition
to
feedback
based
on
run-time
and
output
checking
we
are
particularly
interested
in
immediate
feedback
corrective
guidance
given
as
the
program
is
being
constructed
immediate
feedback
is
a
natural
extension
of
the
block-based
language
philosophy
block-based
languages
prevent
by
design
certain
types
of
mistakes
in
all
cases
immediate
feedback
guides
against
without
fully
preventing
problem-specific
mistakes
ie
constructions
that
are
erroneous
in
only
some
cases
a
feedback
specification
contains
a
block
pattern
and
a
set
of
actions
that
can
be
taken
whenever
the
corresponding
pattern
is
present
or
absent
in
the
students
block
program
for
a
given
problem
the
paper
illustrates
the
language
through
several
examples
derived
from
misconceptions
found
in
the
block-based
programs
of
students
taking
a
university-level
computational
thinking
class
the
feasibility
of
the
proposed
approach
is
shown
by
the
translation
of
a
specification
using
an
evolving
programmatic
interface
in
blockpy
a
dual
blocktext
programming
environment
for
a
subset
of
python
this
paper
discusses
how
social
digital
literacy
is
being
used
in
cs1
to
teach
critical
and
computational
thinking
by
delivering
content
to
students
through
the
use
of
social
media
social
digital
literacy
sdl
is
the
way
in
which
people
use
social
media
to
enhance
their
social
network
effectively
increase
their
knowledge
base
while
communicating
clearly
and
professionally
through
the
use
of
social
media
the
increased
popularity
of
social
media
amongst
college
students
makes
it
an
opportune
time
to
consider
a
new
form
of
literacy
based
on
how
technology
is
used
by
students
the
devices
that
students
interact
with
on
a
daily
bases
and
the
mainstream
acceptance
of
social
media
in
daily
life
in
order
to
retain
students
in
computing
classes
students
are
taught
in
an
efficacious
manner
how
to
capitalize
on
the
technology
that
they
use
on
a
daily
basis
by
increasing
their
sdl
proficiency
to
become
a
more
informed
student
a
well
versed
employee
and
consciously
aware
of
what
they
post
to
social
media
the
expectation
is
that
the
approach
being
used
can
be
implemented
in
any
introductory
programming
course
for
the
last
three
years
the
cs
for
all
initiative
at
the
national
science
foundation
has
had
a
call
for
research-practice
partnership
rpp
projects
the
goal
of
the
program
is
to
advance
both
knowledge
and
practice
in
creating
inclusive
responsive
computer
sciencecomputational
thinking
programs
for
all
k-12
youth
rpps
represent
an
approach
to
research
that
by
design
is
both
more
equitable
and
more
ethical
because
it
leverages
community
stakeholder
experiences
and
perspectives
to
inform
research
questions
methods
and
meaning-making
rpps
are
thus
potentially
powerful
tools
for
equity-oriented
initiatives
such
as
cs
for
all
beginning
in
december
2016
the
research
practice
collaboratory
an
nsf-funded
initiative
based
at
the
university
of
washington
has
led
ten
rpp
development
workshops
for
cs
for
all
collectively
serving
over
700
members
of
the
community
at
these
workshops
we
have
collected
data
about
how
the
community
sees
itself
benefiting
from
the
adoption
of
rpp
approaches
to
the
work
in
this
experience
paper
we
describe
what
we
have
learned
about
the
fields
interests
with
respect
to
adopting
rpp
approaches
to
the
work
for
all
computer
scientists
the
term
modeling
is
well
known
it
displays
an
often-used
method
which
is
applied
in
each
field
of
computer
science
to
investigate
describe
and
plan
problems
or
structures
with
the
help
of
models
large
and
complex
structures
are
divided
into
smaller
parts
which
leads
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
problem
and
often
provides
input
for
the
solution
with
the
help
of
different
types
of
models
different
perspectives
of
one
problem
can
be
observed
and
discussed
these
processes
are
not
only
part
of
computer
science
respectively
computational
thinking
problem_solving
skills
are
needed
in
any
domain
and
should
be
trained
as
well
as
possible
in
primary
and
secondary_education
this
could
be
supported
by
the
computer
science
concept
of
modeling
including
processes
like
reduction
decomposition
abstraction
generalization
etc
and
appropriate
techniques
like
uml
unified
modeling
language
or
the
entity-relationship
model
we
suppose
that
a
consequent
use
of
modeling
beginning
in
different
subjects
during
primary
and
secondary_education
can
train
and
improve
problem-solving
skills
before
being
able
to
verify
this
hypothesis
it
is
necessary
to
find
a
way
to
integrate
modeling
in
schools
despite
of
not
being
part
of
the
curriculum
this
is
one
aim
of
our
project
“informatics
-
a
childs
play”
which
tries
to
implement
different
computer
science
concepts
in
different
subjects
of
primary
and
secondary_education
to
reach
this
goal
we
firstly
have
to
convince
and
train
teachers
in
this
paper
some
topics
of
modeling
are
presented
as
they
were
adapted
for
workshops
in
primary
and
early
secondary_education
considering
the
age
and
interests
of
the
students
as
well
as
topics
taken
from
their
surroundings
furthermore
we
present
first
evaluation
results
concerning
its
acceptance
and
usefulness
for
teachers
and
students
as
well
as
their
performance
in
understanding
and
applying
modeling
in
different
lessons
the
industry
revolution
40
was
first
being
introduced
in
malaysia
on
september
2018
the
reaction
from
this
introduction
has
initiated
the
malaysian
government
to
promote
industry
revolution
40
in
industrial
manufacturing
and
construction
system
this
however
gives
impact
to
the
graduating
student
whom
seeking
for
employment
where
specific
skills
were
required
by
the
industry
the
gap
of
skills
was
identified
in
this
study
questionnaire
survey
was
distributed
among
graduating
students
and
alumni
mean
score
and
relative
importance
index
were
used
in
the
analysis
the
finding
reveals
that
the
most
skill
required
by
the
industry
are
computational
thinking
rank
1
follow
by
social
intelligent
rank
2
and
design
mindset
rank
3
the
findings
of
this
study
can
be
used
as
a
reference
for
the
universities
to
review
the
engineering
curriculum
and
syllabus
we
introduce
kappa
an
electronic
tangible
interface
development
kit
designed
to
promote
computational
thinking
for
school
students
kappa
enables
students
to
create
interactive
games
animated
stories
and
musical
instruments
using
physical
objects
we
discuss
the
design
considerations
the
working
mechanism
and
the
need
for
such
a
toolkit
in
technology
education
we
also
discuss
results
and
observations
from
a
pilot
deployment
of
the
kit
in
a
school
in
urban
india
in
a
project-based_learning
context
research
has
identified
multiple
reasons
why
people
do
end-user
programming
but
has
yet
to
quantify
one
of
the
most
basic
making
more
money
this
is
an
important
gap
in
the
literature
given
the
current
widespread
efforts
to
promote
computational
thinking
skills
because
this
education
campaign
is
often
linked
to
the
argument
that
end-user
programming
skills
will
contribute
to
workers
long-term
career
prospects
therefore
this
paper
presents
a
study
investigating
how
the
earnings
of
workers
varied
as
a
function
of
whether
they
used
spreadsheetsdatabases
andor
did
programming
at
work
examining
survey
data
from
2003
revealed
a
positive
correlation
of
earnings
against
these
variables
even
after
controlling
for
the
occupations
of
workers
overall
occupation-adjusted
earnings
were
14
higher
for
workers
who
used
spreadsheetsdatabases
and
who
also
did
programming
versus
those
who
did
neither
these
results
provoke
numerous
questions
for
future
research
regarding
what
financial
benefits
workers
can
expect
to
obtain
in
different
settings
through
end-user
programming
the
results
obtained
by
the
elementary_school
students
in
subjects
like
math
and
portuguese
mother
language
have
been
worrisome
during
the
last
few
years
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
but
opinions
point
to
the
students
inability
to
solve
problems
difficulties
in
logical
reasoning
and
lack
of
critical
attitude
the
portuguese
ministry
of
education
proposed
in
20152016
in
extracurricular
period
the
getting
started
with
programming
challenging
in
primary_school
activities
with
the
intention
of
promoting
computational
thinking
competences
in
students
two
schools
from
coimbra
city
opted
to
use
scratch
software
for
the
implementation
of
this
project
aiming
to
promote
school
success
in
subjects
already
mentioned
the
project
based
on
the
academic
curriculum
of
4th
grade
intends
to
link
the
theoretical
knowledge
with
the
practical
knowledge
promoting
the
characteristic
values
of
the
city
of
coimbra
this
project
implementation
resulted
in
different
applications
computer
games
created
by
students
covering
the
contents
of
the
mentioned
subjects
but
concretizing
these
knowledge
with
the
socio-cultural
and
environmental
realities
of
the
city
of
coimbra
the
following
study
demonstrates
the
results
obtained
in
5
classes
in
2015-2016
and
six
classes
in
2016-2017
according
to
student
satisfaction
and
project
evaluation
the
rapid
integration
of
ai
technology
and
education
will
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
traditional
education
and
teaching
ideas
forms
contents
methods
and
will
also
put
forward
new
and
higher
requirements
for
teachers
professional
quality
and
teaching
ability
for
normal
university
students
ai
quality
cultivation
and
application
ability
training
are
particularly
important
based
on
the
previous
research
this
paper
holds
that
digital
literacy
computational
thinking
programming
ability
and
deep
cognition
of
intelligent
society
are
the
important
contents
of
ai
technology
literacy
of
normal
university
students
and
put
forward
that
under
the
ai
environment
normal
university
students
learning
ability
teaching
ability
teaching
research
ability
three
aspects
as
well
as
basic
ability
deepening
application
application
innovation
three
levels
of
ability
training
strategy
and
points
out
that
normal
university
students
should
learn
ai
technology
and
theory
in
practice
cultivate
ai
quality
and
application
ability
in
teaching
and
improve
human-machine
cooperation
skills
in
exploration
computational
thinking
and
coding
has
received
considerable
attention
over
the
past
several
years
considerable
efforts
worldwide
suggest
the
need
for
more
empirical
studies
providing
evidence-based
practices
to
introduce
and
engage
children
with
coding
activities
the
main
goal
of
this
study
is
to
examine
which
programming
concepts
students
use
when
they
want
to
develop
a
game
and
what
is
the
interrelation
among
these
concepts
to
achieve
our
goal
a
field
study
was
designed
and
data
were
collected
from
coding
activities
in
detail
during
a
two-week
period
one-day
workshops
were
organized
almost
every
day
on
which
44
children
participating
in
with
ages
between
8-17
the
workshops
follow
a
constructionist
approach
and
comprise
of
two
parts
first
the
children
interact
with
robots
and
then
develop
a
game
using
scratch
the
findings
provide
a
deeper
understanding
on
how
children
code
by
showing
the
use
of
specific
programming
concepts
to
develop
their
projects
and
their
correlations
hence
we
improve
our
knowledge
about
childrens
competences
in
coding
educational
robotics
is
a
practice
that
has
been
disseminated
in
brazil
and
in
the
world
allowing
the
inclusion
of
technology
in
the
school
environment
through
stimulating
pedagogical
activities
for
students
making
them
practice
teamwork
fine
motor
coordination
and
computational
thinking
among
other
benefits
for
the
educational
robotics
classes
to
be
executed
in
the
most
effective
way
the
teacher
must
be
trained
to
use
this
tool
and
from
there
propose
andor
execute
classes
that
use
the
technology
to
help
in
the
teaching
of
curricular
subjects
in
basic
education
however
many
teachers
do
not
realize
what
can
be
possible
with
robotics
in
the
classroom
and
this
often
causes
them
not
to
choose
to
learn
more
about
this
technology
in
this
work
we
developed
a
web
system
called
repo-educ
in
which
a
teacher
can
access
information
about
robotics
lessons
created
by
other
teachers
generating
ideas
about
how
to
apply
robotics
in
their
classroom
using
this
system
it
is
possible
to
transform
robotics
education
by
combining
knowledge
even
teachers
who
have
never
had
contact
with
robotics
can
start
using
this
technology
in
the
classroom
by
replicating
lessons
that
are
proven
to
work
by
other
teachers
the
system
is
in
the
final
stages
of
development
to
be
made
available
to
the
educational
robotics
community
this
paper
purports
to
share
with
the
higher_education
community
the
global
pbl
active
learning
curriculum
and
the
learning
environment
which
have
been
collaboratively
developed
with
the
universities
in
taiwan
and
kansai
university
ku
the
collaborated
universities
developed
an
optimal
curriculum
to
enhance
and
nurture
students
in
recent
years
in
all
contexts
of
our
lives
we
have
seen
a
real
explosion
of
data
from
a
research
standpoint
data
processing
needs
have
increasingly
become
common
in
an
ever
growing
number
of
applications
with
potential
benefits
not
only
in
our
work
but
also
in
our
lives
the
need
not
just
to
acquire
store
and
perform
modest
operational
tasks
but
also
to
analyze
and
properly
interpret
data
in
this
talk
we
consider
some
of
the
hottest
and
most
demanding
scenarios
in
our
daily

the
appearance
of
moocs
has
boosted
the
creation
of
educational
material
for
use
in
all
possible
contexts
however
this
material
is
often
created
without
much
thought
and
without
proper
tools
and
methodologies
much
more
attention
should
be
placed
on
the
design
of
educational
material
since
this
is
the
basis
for
a
successful
learning
experience
in
this
special
session
we
report
about
several
interesting
approaches
towards
the
design
and
creation
of
educational
material
that
range
from
the
call
to
the
definition
of
a
discipline
of
courseware
engineering
to
a
methodology
for
video
recording
another
one
for
the
creation
of
smart
adaptive
content
tools
metrics
for
teaching
computational

the
integration
of

and
the
design
and
application
of
game-based

in
this
paper
it
is
described
a

took
place
at

music
that
appeals
to
the

generation
may
be
difficult
for

to
appreciate
and
vice

second
while
a
majority
of
students
engaged
in
music
production
and
coding
we
observed
that
some
students
fixated
on
artistic
musical
expression
without
engaging
in
substantial
computational
thinking
these
findings
may
apply
more
broadly
in
computational
courses
situated
in
expressive
domains
and
to
steam
courses
in
general
we
conclude
with
suggested
changes
to

development
which
may
be
applied
more

the

collaborated
in

the
level

computation
is
becoming
an
integral
part
of
education
especially
at
college-level
two
mooc

provide
an
introduction
to

are
offered
by
mit
on

has
run
16
times
and
6002x
introduction
to

and
data
science
has
run
11
times
these
courses
frame
the
world
around
computation
and
show
learners
that
they
can
think
about
problems
they
see
in
everyday
life
in
the
context
of
computation
our
paper
shows
an
analysis
of
repeat
learners
learners
who
enroll
in
the
same
course
multiple
times
and
their
behaviors
over
the
many
runs
of
these
courses
around
20
of
learners
in
any
given
run
of
a
course
are
repeat
learners
of
these
the
majority
are
two-time
repeat
learners
learners
who
took
the
same
course
exactly
twice
we
show
that
learners
tend
to
perform
better
when
they
retake
a
course
and
especially
when
they
retake
the
course
sooner
rather
than
later
we
also
look
at
a
subgroup
of
learners
we
call
repeat
cross-referencers
learner
who
accessed
at
least
two
previous
runs
of
the
course
during
the
run
time
of
a
later
run
of
the
course
we
found
that
repeat
cross-referencers
complete
the
course
at
a
suspiciously
high
rate
and
we
speculate
it
is
because
they
are
looking
back
at
answers
from
a
previous
course
run
lastly
we
look
at
how
learners
perform
in
an
introductory
class
and
an
advanced
class
we
found
that
many
learners
who
take
both
courses
are
more
likely
to
complete
both
courses
and
have
more
active
days
in
the
courses
than
those
learners
who
only
do
one
of
the
two
classes

of
how

resources
and

outcomes
computational
thinking
in
recent
years
has
been
universally
defined
as
the
”new
english”
or
basic
knowledge
necessary
for
everyone
as
english
is
important
to
include
it
as
early
as
possible
in
teaching
programs
right
from
preschool
this
need
is
so
felt
as
to
make
it
for
example
compulsory
in
kindergarten
in
italy
since
2022
obviously
this
implies
the
use
of
simple
tools
that
do
not
provide
reading
and
writing
skills
this
work
proposes
a
learning
program
which
could
be
carried
out
precisely
during
the
three
years
of
kindergarten
from
3
to
6
years
of
age
and
prepares
children
for
coding
a
teaching
subject
that
has
already
been
proposed
in
italy
for
primary_school
since
a
few
years
the
demand
for
cybersecurity
professionals
is
projected
to
grow
substantially
with
the
us
bureau
of
labor
statistics
reporting
that
employment
in
cybersecurity
within
the
us
will
grow
by
18
from
2014
to
2024
much
faster
than
the
average
for
all
occupations
as
creating
a
cyberspace
workforce
has
become
a
matter
of
national
security
for
every
country
cybersecurity
needs
to
be
taught
at
all
levels
to
all
students
in
the
educational
system
the
good
news
is
that
cybersecurity
is
also
a
topic
that
students
from
a
wide
variety
of
backgrounds
find
interesting
and
as
a
result
it
motivates
them
to
study
computing
too
over
the
past
two
decades
there
has
been
an
increased
effort
worldwide
to
incorporate
computer
science
and
computational
thinking
into
the
middle
and
high_school
curriculum
the
cs10k
initiative
in
the
us
has
led
to
projects
to
introduce
computer
science
at
the
k-12
educational
level
one
of
these
initiatives
the
new
advanced
placement
ap
course
in
computer
science
principles
csp
was
designed
to
introduce
computer
science
in
an
engaging
way
show
students
how
computing
is
relevant
in
their
lives
and
to
attract
a
diverse
group
of
students
to
computing
the
csp
curriculum
framework
allows
for
multiple
implementations
of
the
csp
course
permitting
course
designers
to
develop
courses
to
engage
and
attract
specific
groups
of
students
and
that
focus
on
specific
themes
in
computing
this
paper
describes
an
approach
to
develop
a
new
csp
course
cybercsp
which
integrates
cybersecurity
first
principles
throughout
the
course
the
approach
builds
on
an
csp
course
that
was
created
from
a
previous
collaboration
between
the
computer
science
department
at
rochester
institute
of
technology
rochester
new
york
and
the
webster
central
school
district
in
webster
new

the
paper
discusses
the
background
details
of
the
earlier
csp
course
how
relevant
cybersecurity
content
was
identified
and
then
integrated
into
the
csp
course
to
create
the
cybercsp
variant
of
the
computer
science
principles
course
in
this
paper
we
call
for
computational
archival
studies
to
prioritize
social
justice
and
community-centeredness
our
initial
research
findings
as
well
as
the
work
of
community
archives
provide
evidence
of
the
need
to
elevate
and
truly
center
the
voices
of
those
depicted
or
underrepresented
in
large-scale
digital
archives
leveraging
the
power
of
computational
thinking
with
the
transformative
experience
of
seeing
oneself
represented
or
representing
oneself
in
digital

how
to
meet
the

and
train
the

are
essential

in
the

as
reproducible
research
tools
and

become
increasingly
in-demand
across
disciplines
so
too
does
the
need
for
innovative
and
collaborative
training
while
some
academic
departments
incorporate
software
like
r
or
python
in
coursework
and
research
many
students
remain
reliant
on
self-teaching
in
order
to
gain
the
necessary
skills
to
work
with
their
data
however
given
the
growing
number
of
students
interested
in
computational
tools
and
resources
for
research
automation
relying
on
student
self-teaching
and
learning
is
not
an
efficient
method
for
training
the
next
generation
of
scholars
to
address
the
educational
need
for
computational

and
learning
across
various
academic
departments
on

has
been
running

of
serving
as
a
trusted

has
been
well
positioned
to
provide

for
this

the
core
of

2014-2018
is
funded
by
the
national
science
foundation
and
is
designed
to
broaden
participation
in
computing
by
providing
professional
development
pd
for
high_school
teachers
at
career
technical
education
cte
programs
throughout
the
state
of
new
hampshire
teachers
receive
a
stipend
and
tablets
for
their
classrooms
they
attend
several
in-person
pd
sessions
through
the
year
where
master
teachers
and
pd
facilitators
introduce
modeling
of
inquiry
and
equity-based
practices
as
well
as
teach
the
app
inventor
tool
and
how
to
inculcate
computational
thinking
in
students
project
evaluation
has
included
teacher
interviews
classroom
and
pd
observations
as
well
as
student
and
teacher
surveys
external
evaluation
of
this
project
has
been
an
integral
part
of
the
project
from
the
beginning
and
along
with
the
project
team’s
observations
and
input
has
significantly
reshaped
the
project
activities
it
became
clear
after
the
first
year
that
a
central
challenge
of
this
project
would
be
working
with
a
mix
of
teachers
across
multiple
domains
–
from
teachers
who
had
little
experience
even
using
computers
to
teachers
who
had
computer
science
degrees
from
teachers
who
came
to
teaching
from
professional
backgrounds
to
those
who
had
education
degrees
and
from
beginning
teachers
to
those
who
had
been
teaching
the
same
courses
for
twenty
years
through
evaluation
data
and
really
listening
to
teacher
feedback
we
not
only
tailored
the
pd
content
and
structure
but
also
refined
the
data
collection
instruments
and
evaluation
design
to
bridge
the
gap
between
different
teacher
experiences
and
levels
of
preparation
as
a
result
we
have
been
able
to
bring
computing
into
non-technical
content
areas
such
as
hospitality
and
non-programming
classes
such
as
photography
as
well
as

we
now
better
understand
the
range
of
benefits
and
challenges
involved
in
working
with
cte
programs
and
inserting
ccc-inspired
curricular
modules
in
non-computing
courses
with
the
development
of
science
and
technology
many
industries
begin
to
use
computer
technology
to
improve
work
efficiency
from
the
facts
of
many
practices
we
can
see
that
computer
technology
is
a
good
technology
for
many
industries
and
can
bring
many
benefits
to
the
industry
computer
technology
is
also
deepening
into
legal
practice
in
legal
practice
modeling
simulation
and
other
calculation
methods
can
be
used
to
analyze
legal
relations
so
that
legal
information
can
be
transformed
from
traditional
analysis
to
an
information
and
intelligent
system
with
higher
efficiency
and
accuracy
the
inclusion
classification
in
legal
procedures
can
be
simply
summarized
as
a
model
and
the
eigenvalue
table
structure
is
built
to
make
the
case
enter
the
computer
into
data
that
can
be
calculated
and
judged
this
method
simplifies
the
case
trial
and
makes
the
case
context
clearer
the
deep
integration
of
computational
thinking
and
legal
thinking
is
conducive
to
enrich
and
develop
the
basic
theory
of
law
improve
the
scientificity
and
coordination
of
various

plays
a
positive
role
in
improving

this
study
explores
interactions
between
computational
thinking
gender
and
engineering
identity
among
biomedical
engineering
undergraduate
students
biomedical
engineering
enjoys
higher
rates
of
womens
enrollment
than
other
engineering
disciplines
but
nevertheless
has
gender
disparities
in
persistence
within
the
field
additionally
trends
towards
greater
incorporation
of
computation
into
biomedical
engineering
have
the
potential
to
recreate
the
gender
inequities
seen
in
more
computationally
intensive
engineering
disciplines
recently
engineering
identity
has
emerged
as
a
powerful
analytic
lens
to
understand
persistence
in
engineering
particularly
for
underrepresented
groups
such
as
women
however
there
is
limited
work
examining
how
experiences
using
computational
methods
influences
engineering
identity
formation
in
undergraduate
biomedical
engineers
further
it
remains
unclear
to
what
extent
gender
differentially
mediates
the
effects
of
computational
practice
on
engineering
identity
formation
in
order
to
explore
the
intersection
of
these
issues
we
study
a
thermodynamics
course
in
the
biomedical
engineering
department
of
a
large
midwestern
public
research
institution
in
the
united
states
the
thermodynamics
course
includes
in-class
computational
modeling
group
activities
and
has
an
enrollment
of
more
than
120
primarily
sophomore
year
undergraduate
students
we
use
a
qualitative
study
approach
that
includes
gathering
data
through
classroom
observation
and
detailed
semi-structured
interviews
we
analyze
classroom
observation
data
to
try
to
understand
student
experiences
of
learning
and
participation
during
in-class
computational
modeling
exercises
specifically
we
look
for
evidence
of
gendered
differences
in
task
sorting
and
engagement
with
the
exercise
classroom
data
is
complemented
by
semi-structured
interviews
thematic
analysis
of
semi-structured
interviews
gains
students
perspectives
on
how
gender
has
influenced
their
learning
experience
and
their
identity
as
engineers
artificial

is
successfully
intervening
in

such
as
education

ai
is
being
used
to
improve

processes
unesco
considers
as
a
new
vision
to
involve
ai
not
only
as
a
didactic
medium
but
also
as
a
science
in
which
children
can
develop
their
intellect
through
workshops
courses
and
curricula
focused
on
the
fundamentals
of
ai
allowing
them
to
develop
skills
such
as
computational
thinking
and
critical_thinking
the
present
systematic
literature
review
was
developed
according
to
the
methodological
guidelines
proposed
by
barbara
kitchenham
with
the
objective
of
identifying
how
ai
teaching-learning
processes
are
carried
out
from
early
ages
sixty-four
studies
were
obtained
between
2016-2021
where
eleven
countries
are
identified
with
ai
teaching
initiatives
through
workshops
courses
and
projects
to
update
their
curricula
machine
learning
and
educational
robotics
are
the
two
branches
linked
to
ai
that
are
currently
taught
to
children
and
adolescents
we
describe
our
early
investigation
of
the
integration
of
educational
modules
originally
developed
for
a
college-level
entering
students
program
esp
titled
“media
propelled
computational

mpct
into
high_school
science
math
and
engineeringtechnology
courses
primary
objectives
of
mpct
include
introducing
students
to
imperative
programming
and
reinforcement
of
foundational
mathematical
concepts
this
report
describes
this
evolving
integration
including
early
informal
experiments
and
potential
extensions
using
programming
functions
of
ubiquitous
graphing

students
emotional
state
plays
a
vital
role
in
learning
in
this
study
we
examined
the
emotional
changes
of
69
students
during
the
lectures
of
the
c
language
programming
foundation
and
computational
thinking
in
central
china
this
paper
presents
a
method
using
yolov7
and
the
convolutional
neural
network
coatnet
to
monitor
students
emotional
evolution
by
analyzing
their
facial
expressions
and
recognizing
academic
affective
states
including
boring
confused
focus
happy
and
neutral
the
trained
model
has
achieved
a
test
accuracy
of
760
the
results
showed
that
focus
increased
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
10
minutes
of
class
and
then
began
to
decline
with
the
decline
of
focus
emotion
students
neutral
emotions
increased
we
found
that
when
a
new
teaching
session
is
performed
or
the
teaching
method
of
naming
questions
is
used
the
students
emotion
of
focus
increases
briefly
lasting
about
8–10
minutes
subsequently
even
if
the
varied
teaching
method
was
used
to
stimulate
students
attention
their
level
of
engagement
did
not
increase
significantly
it
can
be
suggested
that
teachers
can
use
teaching
methods
appropriately
to
promote
students
attention
however
students
attention
span
is
limited
and
teachers
should
pay
attention
to
methods
and
time
to
improve
teaching
quality
effectively
the
program
“introduction
to
programming
in
the
first
cycle
of
basic
education”
initiated
in
2015
has
provided
the
opportunity
to
develop
computational
thinking
and
digital
literacy
among
students
the
existing
literature
suggests
that
scratch
programming
language
may
have
a
strong
influence
on
the
skills
acquired
by
students
in
classroom
in
this
context
it
is
intended
to
build
an
intervention
with
objectives
that
fit
into
the
student
profile
leaving
compulsory
education
and
developed
within
the
scope
of
curricular
flexibility
recommended
for
the
1st
year
of
basic

aims
to
evaluate
the
impact
on

minecraft
is
one
of
the
most
popular
games
among
youth
today
experiencing
sales
over
100
million
worldwide
and
channels
on
youtube
generating
over
47
billion
views
our
interest
in
the
game
environment
is
due
to
its
innate
computational
mechanics
that
integrate
logic
design
and
scripting
elements
because
of
these
traits
many
organizations
and
schools
are
looking
to
incorporate
minecraft
into
their
curriculum
to
support
computational
thinking
and
computational
practices
however
there
are
challenges
surrounding
the
distribution
and
availability
of
individuals
who
possess
the
technical
and
computational
expertise
needed
to
support
these
opportunities
in
this
poster
we
introduce
the
dyn
minecraft
server
project
the
project
is
designed
to
address
barriers
of
entry
for
adults
at
schools
and
youth-serving
organizations
who
want
to
provide
computing-related
learning
opportunities
to
diverse
youth
we
worked
with
families
city
organizations
mentors
and
youth
to
modify
the
commercially
available
minecraft
to
support
adults
who
may
have
limited
expertise
in
computing
or
minecraft
yet
wish
to
use
the
platform
in
order
to
teach
computational
content
the
modifications
include
the
integration
of
an
information
network
that
promotes

that
are
available
throughout

this
paper
discusses
how
a
connection
between
programming
and
creative
work
in
terms
of
visual
and
interactive
art
can
be
of
interest
in
the
educational
context
of
learning
programming
there
are
strong
indications
that
a
creative
approach
in
programming
allows
to
pay
attention
to
institutional
and
social
requirements
concerning
computer
science
education
this
includes
the
students
interest
and
motivation
as
well
as
their
performance
and
knowledge
acquisition
even
though
this
has
been
discussed
before
this
paper
presents
a
first
basic
structure
of
a
didactic
concept
enabling
an
integration
of
creative
coding
as
an
additional
path
for
teaching
computer
science
in

in
baden-württemberg
germany
taking
existing
approaches
into
account
basic
ideas
of
creative
coding
are
identified
and
connected
to
the
concepts
of
computational
thinking
in
this
paper
we
present
a
cares
model
for
computing
education
it
consists
of
three
layers
core
layer
“think”
course
layer
“learn”
and
careerdevelopment
layer
“develop”
the
core
layer
is
concerned
with
two
fundamental
thinking
skills
computational
thinking
and
creative
thinking
the
course
layer
is
about
the
curriculum
the
careerdevelopment

elements
of
the

model
and
the
teaching
experience
for
this
subject
is
presented
with
the
rapid
development
of
science
and
technology
over
the
world
programming
education
has
shown
as
a
trend
in
decades
programming
courses
have
been
offered
in
primary_education
to
promote
students’
computational
thinking
skills
however
teaching
and
learning
programming
in
primary
schools
involve
different
knowledge
including
complex
mathematical
concepts
and
programming
syntax
also
traditional
teaching
methods
may
not
effectively
cater
for
students’
individual
needs
and
learning
trajectories
thus
learning
difficulties
are
common
among
students
teachers
keep
examining
innovation
on
programming
education
to
improve
their
teaching
this
study
investigated
used
a
pretest-posttest
method
with
two
groups
of
grade
five
students
in
macao
to
compare
the
influence
of
two
pedagogical
strategies
flipped_classroom
and
traditional
teaching
in
students’
learning
achievements
the
major
findings
of
the
study
showed
that
the
experimental
group
in
flipped_classroom
had
significantly
higher
learning
achievements
than
the
control
group
in
the
programming
course
moreover
the
students
in
the
flipped_classroom
showed
a
significant
effective
mastery
of
more
complex
programming
concepts
such
as
conditions
and
loops
educational
robotics
provides
a
dynamic
and
effective
platform
for
fostering
diverse
skills
and
competencies
in
this
context
this
paper
explores
creating
and
implementing
a
robotics
club
in
a
high_school
the
proposed
methodology
emphasizes
the
educational
tripod
teaching
research
and
extension
therefore
the
paper
outlines
the
club’s
conception
the
sources
of
inspiration
and
the
achieved
outcomes
within
the
school
and
local
community
it
also
highlights
the
activities
and
small
projects
developed
by
the
students
and
the
active
participation
of
the
club
members
in
the
brazilian
national
robotics
olympics
furthermore
through
student
reports
and
an
internal
survey
the
paper
emphasizes
the
remarkable
development
of
desired
competencies
including
creativity
teamwork
problem-solving
and
computational

classes
from
the

collected
in
these
three
classes
over
the
course
of
a

were
computed
from
several
computational
thinking
patterns
by
comparing
the
results
learning
progressions
some
obvious
and
some
not
so
obvious
indications
emerged
we
believe
that
the
more
obvious
indications
give
credence
to
the
less
obvious
and
hence
the
measurement
tool
this
comparison
between
middle
school
students
and
college
students
demonstrated
that
middle
school
students
learning
progressions
are
slower
than
college
level
students
obvious
but
middle
school
students

skill
scores
reachedsurpassed
the
entry
level
scores
of
students
in
the
college
class
after
designing
only
two
or
more
games
consequently
these
results
tell
us
that
this
measurement
tool
although
not
validated
yet
could
measure
accumulated
learning
in
certain
contexts
although
this
is
just
the
first
the
impact
of
robotics
has
grown
beyond

that
is
both
inexpensive
and

they
revealed
that
teachers
are
still
at
initial
stages
regarding
the
integration
of
digital
tools
in
teaching
and
the
use
of
open
educational
resources
although
variables
like
gender
age
and
academic
background
showed
no
significant
differences
it
was
noted
that
both
the
technological
infrastructure
of
institutions
and
support
for
professional
development
positively
impact
digital
competences
this
underlines
the
importance
of
reinforcing
educational
policies
related

in
2021
the
first
year
of
metaverse
web30
ecosystems
emerged
as
a
result
of
the
internets
de-centralized
evolution
in
the
web30
space
there
has
been
a
very
active
advancement
of
the
generative
art
non-fungible
token
which
is
a
special
asset
stored
on
a
blockchain
that
allows
creators
to
buy
and
sell
assets
and
verify
ownership
in
other
words
as
it
reconstructs
the
interpersonal
relationship
the
generative
art
non-fungible
token
must
carry
cultural
values
to
be
meaningful
and
waiting
to
observe
artificial

generative
art
in
the
future
requires
a
new
mindset
and
posture
design

in
the
form
of
generative
art
to
discuss
the
possibilities
of
future
design
thinking
by
linking
with
social

this
study
also
creates
an
intersection
with
heterogeneous
knowledge
and
stimulates
a
new
thinking
pattern
that
is
different
from
previous
ones
this
project
of
design
and
research
in
the
metaverse
virtual

is
still
a
novel
topic
reviewing
past
literature
indicates
that
relevant
papers
are
very
scarce
and
more
resources
are
urgently
needed
for
research
in
this
field
gamification

the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
integrate
the
peer

strategy
in
scratch
programming
learning
for
students
this

or
general
teaching
method
significantly
an
increasing
number
of
tools
have
been
created
to
assist
students
in
learning
mathematics
robots
have
been
regarded
as
an
especially
powerful
tool
to
help
students
master
mathematics
since
students
can
simultaneously
learn
mathematics
programming
robotic
control
and
computational
thinking
although
a
number
of
educational
robots
and
curricula
have
been
developed
some
of
them
do
not
comply
with
math
standards
so
they
are
primarily
suitable
for
after-school
programs
camps
or
workshops
students
might
not
be
able
to
focus
on
learning
mathematics
now
that
writing
a
program
might
be
difficult
for
them
due
to
debugging
in
this
paper
mathematics
curricula
that
meet
math
standards
are
developed
with
a
block-based
programming
platform
roboblocky
linkbots
are
utilized
as
robots
in
the
curricula
to
teach
and
learn
mathematics
in
school
settings
students
learn
mathematics
by
observing
the
motions
of
robots
in
simulations
or
on
real
mats
most
students
improved
greatly
in
mathematics
after
using
the
curricula
it
is
expected
that
the
curricula
based
on
roboblocky
will
continue
to
be
improved
to
enable
more
middle
and
high_school
students
to
be
successful
in
learning
mathematics

posits
itself
as
a
cyber-island
with
a
fully

hub
it
has
become
imperative
to
think
about
leveraging
the
teaching
of
computer
science
in
lower
secondary
schools
grades
7-9
so
far
this
has
been
limited
to
basic
courses
in
computing
that
are
essentially
theory
focused
this
paper
states
that
students
at
this
stated
level
need
to
develop
computational
thinking
so
that
they
are
ready
for
the
workplace
and
will
effectively
enter
the
digital
world
it
limits
itself
to
two
key
variables
resource
leveraging
and
teaching
computing
in
the
first
case
it
raises
arguments
on
programming
languages
hardware
and
software
that
might
apply
to
students
in
the
new
curriculum
in
the
teaching
area
the
paper
suggests
that
a
combination
of
teaching
programming
inclusion
and
informal
learning
will
be
the
possibilities
to
accompany
students
overcome
the
digital
divide
and
get
the
opportunity
to
become
effective
as

to
serve
their
nation
dynamic
geometry
systems
dgs
are
widely
used
in
mathematics
education
to
enhance
students
thinking
skills
through
geometric
exploration
integrating
programming
into
dgs
fosters
both
mathematical
and
computational
thinking
however
research
on
reverse
debugging
design
for
programmable
dynamic
geometry
systems
is
limited
and
existing
systems
fail
to
meet
the
needs
for
operation
reversal
to
address
this
this
paper
proposes
a
programming
environment
that
supports
reverse
debugging
aiming
to
overcome
the
limitations
of
current
programmable
dynamic
geometry
systems
in
debugging
we
abstracted
dynamic
geometry
operations
and
defined
three
types
of
drawing
instructions
to
ensure
sequential
execution
and
debugging
we
designed
a
debuggable
sequential
execution
algorithm
followed
by
a
reverse
debugging
control
algorithm
the
effectiveness
of
the
system
is
verified
by
experiments
this
research
to
practice
work
in

has
two
main
objectives
i
the
improvement
of
interdisciplinary
teaching
and
learning
processes
in
an
integrated
course
of
informatics
in
high_school
course
and
ii
turning
students
into
learners
by
the
designing
and
development
of
innovative
features
for
m-learning
applications
such
objectives
are
integrated
each
other
since
the
improvement
in
the
teaching
and
learning
processes
will
not
be
restricted
in
the
proposal
and
use
of
a
practical
framework
for
the
improvement
of
students
skills
in
the
computational
thinking
but
also
in
the
use
of
the
m-learning
features
and
applications
to
improve
educational
issues
faced
by
both
students
and
teachers
in
this
perspective
active-learning
and
problem-based_learning
theories
were
considered
to
support
the
proposal
of
a
series
of
activities
composing
a
framework
to
be
adopted
to
achieve
the
target
objectives
the
interdisciplinary
teaching
and
learning
processes
improvement
has
its
roots
at
the
proposal
of
solutions
for
problems
into
disciplines
of
high_school
curricula
through
the
innovative
m-learning
features
to
be
designed
and
developed
by
the
students
in
this
paper
it
is
discussed
the
motivations
about
the
proposal
of
this
project
the
teaching
and
learning
implications
in
the
context
of
a
integrated
course
of
informatics
in
high_school
course
its
planning
and
a
pilot
conduction
of
mainly
initial
activities
with
the
volunteers
students
such
activities
include
a
the
identification
of
problems
and
the
planning
of
solutions
based
on
m-learning

b
the
design
and

phases
of
an
initial
set

and
c
a
preliminary
evaluation
of
usability
of
some
mockups
of
m-learning
application
at
the
end
the
identified
evidence
are
discussed
mainly
those
related
with
the
implications
for
the
interdisciplinary
scenario
for
the
teaching
and
learning
processes
the
initial
identification
of
benefits
in
the
perspective
of
the
participation
of
students
as
learners
and
the
future
work
as
well
how
do
oprah
the
multimedia
mogul
and
edison
the
inventor
of
the
telephone
both
inspire
teachers
and
students
to
learn
computational
thinking
a
csct
focused
module
was
developed
by
two
grade
4
teachers
that
would
introduce
culturally
relevant
role
models
to
students
in
an
urban
school
district
the
module
engages
students
through
a
“choose

activity
focusing
on
perseverance

to
model
what
would
happen
if
one
of

from
springfield
ma
public
schools
and
researchers
from
the

we
will
spotlight
this
module
to
show
how
the
module
was
designed
and
taught
to
make
it
an
engaging
equitable
learning
experience
for
all
students
and
share
their
learning
outcomes
along
the
way
our
goal
is
to
share
how
we
designed
and
integrated
culturally
responsive
computer
science
curriculum
at
the
elementary
level
that
will
ensure
equitable
learning
for
all
students
our
goal
is
to
show
how
we
engaged
dyads
in
a
design
based
collaborative
process
to
produce
a
module
for
their
grade
level
the
department
of
computer
science
at
hampton
university
was
awarded
the
hbcu-up
tip
project
to
reform
three
gateway
courses
and
implement
an
intensive
computing
summer
bridge
program
sbp
in
an
effort
to
improve
student
academic
performance
and
increase
retention
and
graduation
rates
in
the
major
by
integrating
computational
thinking
into
lower-level
courses
the
proposed
project
also
seeks
to
strengthen
computer
science
students
and
better
prepare
them
to
meet
the
modern
demands
in
the
field
in
the
first
year
of
the
project
there
have
been
several
changes
to
the
curriculum
content
of
the
gateway
courses
as
well
as
the
implementation
of
the
summer
pre-college
program
the
summer
2014
was
the
first
computing
pre-college
program
there
were
nineteen
participants
currently
in
the
summer
program
the
students
were
engaged
and
excited
to
be
a
part
of
this
program
the
computer
science
seminar
course
served
as
the
initiative
for
a
supplemental
undergraduate
research
award
request
the
course
focused
not
only
ensuring
the
students
understand
computer
science
as
a
field
of
study
but
also
how
computer
science
impacts
all
fields
of
study
and
everything
in
their
daily
lives
there
were
several
speakers
fbi
industry
university
faculty
and
previous
graduates
the
initial
results
has
been
extremely
rewarding
as
we
noticed
from
their
performance
in
the
first
semester
program
course
cs1
this
poster
will
discuss
the
curriculum
we
used
during
the
summer
program
sample
exercises
feedback
from
students
as
well
as
lesson
learnt
for
us
to
improve
next
year
program
for
the
teaching
status
of
python
programming
course
in
financial
and
economic
colleges
and
universities
this
paper
analyzes
the
common
shortcomings
and
proposes
the
reconstruction
of
the
program
design
course
from
four
aspects
teaching
objectives
course
contents
teaching
methods
and
assessment
methods
that
is
under
the
teaching
objectives
and
principles
based
on
market
demand
the
teaching
contents
should
be
integrated
the
practice
teaching
should
be
strengthened
multi-dimensional
hybrid
teaching
methods
and
procedural
assessment
should
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
stimulating
students
interests
keeping
high
motivation
finally
it
can
mobilize
students
enthusiasm
for
independent
learning
and
cultivating
their
ability
to
solve
complex
professional
problems
with
computational
thinking
computer

cs
unplugged
is
a
method
of
teaching
computer
science
and
computational

the
aim
of
our
study
is
to
illustrate
program
behavior
and
to
prevent
confusion
about
the
program
stack
through
visualization
to
facilitate
recognition
we
used
a
toy
consisting
of
a
ball
pipes
and
magnetic
panels
the
ball
represents
which
line
of
code
is
executed
similar
to
the
program
counter
to
demonstrate
the
feasibility
of
the
proposed
method
we
present
three
examples
based
on
the
proposed
method
the
examples
are
necessity
of
loop
to
wait
user
input
necessity
of
loop
to
keep
program
running
and
software
testing
we
conducted
an
experiment
with
nine
participants
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
the
proposed
method
the
result
suggested
that
the
proposed
method
is
expected
to
be
effective
the
stem
methodology
has
been
applied
in
different
study
approaches
covering
different
areas
such
as
arts
internet
of
things
computational
thinking
among
others
in
this
paper
two
necessary
approaches
are
addressed
for
the
implementation
of
a
closed-loop
control
system
the
first
approach
programming
is
directly
related
to
the
software
implementation
and
the
second
approach
addresses
the
hardware
instrumentation
part
both
approaches
are
developed
in
a
practical
teaching
case
from
a
stem
maker
workshop
which
consisted
of
15
sessions
with
duration
2
hours
each
one
each
session
consisted
of
4
stages

4
challenge
through
these
four
stages
the
development
of
skills
of
the
attendees
in
the
areas
of
programming
and
electronics
was
encouraged
applying
the
stem
maker
strategy
from
some
evaluation
instruments
data
was
collected
about
the
development
of
skills
of
the
assistants
in
the
implementation
of
software
and
hardware
instrumentation
acquired
in
the
stem
maker
workshop
the
results
indicated
that
approximately
70
of
the
workshop
attendees
developed
the
necessary
skills
to
propose
solutions
to
problems
in
their
current
context
where
the
application
of
programming
andor
electronics
intervenes
the
product
obtained
from
the
practice
is
described
as
a
temperature
control
which
integrates
a
feedback
signal
this
system
has
a
wide
field
of
applications
which
allowed
the
students
of
the
stem
maker
workshop
to
achieve
a
project
related
to
the
individual
context
of
each
one
computational
thinking
has
become
pervasive
across
many
technical
and
creative
disciplines
creating
a
computationally
literate
workforce
capable
of
recognizing
and
eliminating
algorithmic
discrimination
requires
diverse
perspectives
and
lived
experiences
diversity
within
computing
is
a
persistent
problem
in
2014
several
large
tech
companies
released
diversity
reports
and
made
commitments
to
improvement
as
of
2020
improvements
have
been
minor
especially
for
black
employees
compared
to
us
demographics
the
percentage
of
black
and
latinx
students
pursuing
degrees
in
computing
remains
low
even
as
numbers
improve
in
stem
more
broadly
it
is
more
important
than
ever
to
prioritize
a
diverse
computing
workforce
and
a
computationally
literate
workforce
more
broadly
whose
interests
reside
with
equitable
outcomes
the
programming
education
for
the
students
set
off
a
global
enthusiasm
the
block-python
programming
tools
can
fill
the
gap
from
block-based
programming
to
language
coding
however
there
is
little
work
focus
on
the
evaluation
metrics
for
block-based
python
code
the
past
block-oriented
evaluation
metrics
based
on
computational
thinking
ct
were
not
language-oriented
and
program
volume
was
often
ignored
in
this
paper
we
propose
a
new
evaluation
metrics
for
block-based
python
code
which
combines
the
ct
dimensions
and
program
volume
the
experimental
results
show
that
the
correlations
between
the
proposed
metrics
and
halstead
mccabe
complexity
algorithms
are
both
above

which
is
higher
than

objective
the
objective
of
this
paper
is
to
present
preliminary
work
on
the
development
of
an
educhatbot
tool
and
the
measurement
of
the
effects
of
its
use
aimed
at
providing
effective
feedback
to
programming
course
students
this
bot
hereinafter
referred
to
as
tutorbot
was
constructed
based
on
chatgpt35
and
is
tasked
with
assisting
and
providing
timely
positive
feedback
to
students
in
computer
science
programming
courses
at
ucsc
methodsanalysis
the
proposed
method
consists
of
four
stages
1
immersion
in
the
feedback
and
large
language
models
llms
topic
2
development
of
tutorbot
prototypes
in
both
non-conversational
and
conversational
versions
3
experiment
design
and
4
intervention
and
evaluation
the
first
stage
involves
a
literature
review
on
feedback
and
learning
the
use
of
intelligent
tutors
in
the
educational
context
as
well
as
the
topics
of
llms
and
chatgpt
the
second
and
third
stages
detail
the
development
of
tutorbot
in
its
two
versions
and
the
final
stage
lays
the
foundation
for
a
quasi-experimental
study
involving
students
in
the
curriculum
activities
of
programming
workshop
and
database
workshop
focusing
on
learning
outcomes
related
to
the
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
and
facilitating
the
use
and
measurement
of
the
tool’s
effects
findings
the
preliminary
results
of
this
work
are
promising
as
two
functional
prototypes
of
tutorbot
have
been
developed
for
both
the
non-conversational
and
conversational
versions
additionally
there
is
ongoing
exploration
into
the
possibility
of
creating
a
domain-specific
model
based
on
pretrained
models
for
programming
integrating
tutorbot
with
other
platforms
and
designing
an
experiment
to
measure
student
performance
motivation
and
the
tool’s
effectiveness
learning
how
to
program
can
enhance
the
learners
logic
reasoning
and
computational
thinking
abilities
so
coding
education
become
an
important
policy
in
many
countries
at
the
same
time
there
are
many
visualized

environment
developed
after
mit

was
launched
nevertheless
how
to
conduct
coding
education
is
still
a
big
problem
without
appropriate
programming
competence
indicator
as
a
result
this
study
is
to
constructing
a
series
of
programming
competence
indicator
for
k-12
students
by
adopting
delphi
study
technique
this
study
invites
15
experts
including
experienced
elementary
and
high
schools
teachers
to
survey
and
provide
suggestions
for
this
indicator
after
three
rounds
of
delphi
study
this
study
completed
5-level

the
proposed
indicators
can
be
used
for
formal

and
informal
education
such
as
self-directed
learning
or
cram

the
programming
language
python
is
simple
and
easy
to
learn
and
is
used
for
students
with
no
prior
background
in
programming
several
colleges
and
universities
teach
python
to
students
who
are
learning
a
programming
language
for
the
first
time
in
this
paper
we
present
a
curricular
model
for
introducing
through
active
learning
strategies
data
analytics
concepts
and
applications
into
an
introductory
computer
science
course
for
non-majors
we
have
designed
the
course
to
use
a
variety
of
hands-on
laboratory
projects
that
use
the
python
programming
language
and
associated
tools
while
introducing
students
to
an
important
research
area
we
believe
the
use
of
these
projects
improves
students’
learning
experiences
enables
them
to
apply
and
relate
fundamental
computational
thinking
concepts
of
algorithmic
reasoning
data
representation
and
computational
efficiency
to
data
analytics
problems
assessment
results
show
that
introducing
data
analytics
concepts
and
applications
through
active
learning
strategies
enhanced
students’
computing
capability
to
solve
problems
this

summary
pthe
age
of
ai
will
dramatically
overhaul
the
workforce
by
some
accounts
ai
will
create
more
jobs
than
it
destroys
but
these
jobs
will
require
different
skills
and
education
levels
than
the
ones
displaced
by

this
chapter
outlines
how
to
reframe
the
purpose
of

and
the
practices
to
ensure
that
students
are
prepared
for
whatever
the
world
looks
like
as
the
age
of

develops
the
aix2010driven
workforce
will
require
a
mix
of
technical
and
soft
skills
integrating
ai

areas
will
ensure
that
students
can
adapt
what
they
are
learning
in
any
context
they
find
themselves
in
computational

will
be
a
vital
skill
allowing

and
understand
systems
that
others
build
a
key
component
for
cultivating
innovative

develop
their

survey
that
we
conducted
as
a
pre-cursor
to

artificial
intelligence
is
a
booming
technology
and
is
applied
in
almost
every
domain
of
application
to
design
an
intelligent
system
a
thorough
understanding
of
complex
ai
algorithm
is
required
the
idea
behind
the
ai
algorithm
simulator
was
born
from
the
recognition
that
algorithms
are
a
critical
component
of
a
person’s
computational
thinking
and
programming
abilities
despite
their
complexity
our
ai
algorithm
simulator
seeks
to
make
the
subject
more
accessible
and
engaging
for
learners
the
ai
algorithm
simulator
is
designed
to
be
both
interactive
and
visually
appealing
providing
learners
with
hands-on
experience
in
implementing
algorithms
although
the
research
on
digital
gaming
has
recently
shown
that
collaboration
problem_solving
and
critical_thinking
are
in
evidence
with
k-12
students
who
design
games
researchers
still
need
to
make
the
case
that
digital
game
design
content
meets
rigorous
new
common
core
standards
for
language
arts
and
mathematics
no
class
time
will
be
devoted
to
game
design
unless
proponents
of
digital
gaming
can
develop
and
demonstrate
this
argument
this
preliminary
data
focus
on
a
feasibility
implementation
of
an
assessment
designed
to
embed
these
standards
three
elementary
level
classroom
teachers
and
their
students
used
the
process
and
demonstrated
that
1
teachers
can
learn
to
design
and
use
this
process
and
2
their
students
demonstrate
elements
of
computational
thinking
that
not

includes
the
common

a
high_school
student
probably
gets
frustrated
by
questions
like
these
on
the
ground
that
inquiries
in
arithmetic
the
idea
of
implementing
hacking
on
a
smart
car
should
improve
student’s
interest
and
motivate
them
to
pursue
careers
in
stem-related
areas
however
if
the
same
example
was
demonstrated
to
them
using
a
smart
car
prototype
which
was
hacked
then
there
is
a
good
chance
they
can
get
attracted
towards
technology
and
computing
when
similar
examples
involving
the
various
other
topics
in
their
syllabus
are
shown
they’ll
probably
get
to
see
the
real-life
applications
of
the
topics
they
study
during
high_school
and
after
that
this
paper
introduces
a
new
attempt
that
aims
at
inclining
the
interest
of
high_school

towards
the
courses
in

have
an
escalating

this
paper
provides
the
motivation
for
the
design
of
a

tool
called
agentdesign
a
description
of
its
components
and
a
discussion
of
elementary
students
ability
to
use
it
for
creating
games
the
planning
tool
presented
in
this
paper
was
used
to
engage
elementary
students
in
an
activity
to
design
and
then
create
a
video
game
using
an
agent-based
programming
environment
the
design
of
the
planning
tool
was
informed
by
prior
research
and
literature
on
concept
development
the
tool
scaffolded
the
design
process
by
having
students
1
describe
their
game
2
identify
agents
3
describe
agent
behavior
and
4
use
those
descriptions
to
identify
useful
algorithms
the
set
of
algorithms
used
were
called
computational
thinking
patterns
ctps
and
sample
code
was
provided
for
each
ctp
to
assist
the
programming
process
from
the
information
provided
by
the
student
a
summary
was
created
to
show
needed
agents
and
helpful

to
build
test
and
implement
models
that
are
at
the
center
of
these
financial
activities
in
the
last
decade
computational
finance
cf
has
influenced
the
market
place
extensively
with
enormous
impact
on
wealth
building
employment
opportunities
and
tremendous
economic
growth
this
field
forms
an
ever-expanding
part
of
the
financial
sector
in
numerous
ways
today
the
time
is
therefore
ripe
now
to
bring
together
researchers
in
the
areas
of
finance
using
complicated
financial
models
to
solve
computationally
intensive
problems
and
computer
scientists
having
the
resources
and
solution
methodologies
to
solve
such
problems
the
main
goal
of
this
workshop
is
to
provide
a
timely
forum
for
these
two
groups
to
exchange
and
disseminate
new
ideas
techniques
and
research
in
computational
finance
strong
discussions
will
follow
the
presentations
and
the
experience
could
lead
them
into
the
formulation
implementation
of
the
models
used
by
the
practitioners
in
financial
sector
this
workshop
will
be
a
first
such
effort
in
bringing
together
researchers
in
the
areas
of
finance
and
advanced
computing
i
who
develop
and
employ
parallel
and
distributed
computing
extensively
ii
at
a
venue
where
parallel
distributed
high
performance
computing
is
the
fundamental
thread
of
discussions
and
arguments
most
of
todays
approaches
to
introductory
computer
science
education
reflect
a
1970s
view
of
computer
science
students
typically
create
single-threaded
programs
that
do
local
io
some
of
the
technologies
used
within
these
educational
experiences
include
post-70s
visual
language
elements
like
blocks
to
assist
with
the
syntax
of
programming
but
the
semantics
of
the
programming
have
generally
remained
frozen
in
time
yet
the
field
of
computer
science
has
progressed
enormously
since
the
1970s
multi-core
computing
distributed
systems
and
machine
learning
are
now
ubiquitous
and
have
deep
philosophical
and
practical
ramifications
for
computer
science
education
including
our
definitions
of
what
computational
thinking
is
and
for
how
we
design
new
programming
languages
including
visual
languages
i
will
compare
the
current
state
of
the
art
of
novice
programming
tools
and
theories
to
the
current
state
of
computer
science
and
describe
how
new
conceptual
frameworks
and
visual
programming
tools
could
support
contemporary
computer
science
education
this

the
results
showed
that
the
game-based_learning
in
artificial

courses
could
help
students
to
master
artificial

subject
knowledge
significantly
improved
the
computational

thus
this
study
provides
additional
evidence
that
using
the
game-based_learning
strategies
is
an
effective
learning
method
that
improves
both
learning
performance
and
computational

practices
for
students
majored
in
computer

the
ability
to
have
computational
thinking
is
an
essential
skill
facilitating
computational
thinking
cannot
only
help
students
understand
the
professional
knowledge
and
principles
of
computer
but
also
bring
new
ideas
to
addressing
complex
problems
therefore
many
colleges
and
universities
have
carried
out
computer
professional
curriculum
reform
based
on
computational
thinking
due
to
the
high
degree
of
abstraction
of
computational
thinking
traditional
teaching
methods
will
cause
students
to
understand
computational
thinking
only
at
the
conceptual
level
and
cannot
realize
the
flexible
use
of
computational
thinking
concepts
this
study
takes
the
software
engineering
course
as
an
example
to
explain
how
to
integrate
the
concepts
of
computational
thinking
into
the
original
courses
the
goal
is
to
enable
students
to
understand
software
engineering
contents
problems
from
the
perspective
of
problem-solving
recent
developments
in
pedagogy
have
focused
upon
computational
thinking
computational
thinking
provides
a
way
to
solve
the
problem
and
it
is
a
key
practice
of
science
education
the
importance
of
computational
thinking
is
rarely
found
in
k-12
education
computational
thinking
is
a
an
important
skill
everyone
needs
and
it
is
correlated
with
many
other
concepts
these
factors
have
made
the
development
of
new
tools
and
syllabus
in
this
paper
we
aim
to
show
the
experiments
of
fractal
geometry
using
mit

these
computational
exercises
facilitate
to
learn
many
of
computational
thinking
skills
that
are
very
important
for
the
people
in
the
near
future
based
on
our
experience
with
students
we
claim
that
the
concept
of
fractal
and
its
implementation
in
mit

is
the
best
practices
to
improve
computational

describes
the
shortcomings
of
the
current

which
are
two
key
factors
in
the

has
been
greatly
improved
and
the
teaching

computational
thinking
is
an
urgent
question
in
computer
education
this
paper
analyzes
the
connotation
of
computational

the
embodiment
of
ability
in
assembly
language
and
the
process
of
formation
then
proposes
teaching

in
2009
and
2010
cross-teaching
experiments
have
been
adopted
between
teachers
and

the
feedback
information
from

shows
that
the
introduction
of
computational

computing
can
help
students
to
improve
the
professional
ability
the
teaching
reform
has
achieved
good
results
computational
thinking
is
an
important
concept
that
is
currently
receiving
widespread
attention
in
the
international
computing
community
teaching
programming
is
an
effective
way
to
develop
students
computational
thinking
students
in
adult
colleges
and
universities
face
the
pressure
of
study
and
work
and
there
is
a
need
to
improve
their
computational
thinking
skills
in
this
paper
we
design
and
develop
a
set
of
programming
activities
based
on
computational
thinking
development
for
adult
college
students
and
study
the
changes
in
students
computational
thinking
before
and
after
they
participate
in
the
activities
it
provides
a
reference
for
frontline
teachers
and
related
researchers
to
design
programming
activities
and
conduct
research
in
computational
thinking
as
the
information
age
has
progressed
computational
thinking
ability
to
solve
problems
has
become
an
indispensable
way
of
life
in
life
many
scholars
believe
that
the
process
of
solving
problems
will
be
more
logical
if
they
have
computational
thinking
ability
at
the
same
time
scholars
believe
that
a
good
learning
method
improves
learners
intrinsic
motivation
therefore
in
this
research
we
try
to
use
conceptual
mapping
so
that
students
can
construct
knowledge
when
composing
their
own
images
as
the
focus
of
this
learning
model
and
computational
thinking
is
the
thinking
process
and
the
two
coincide
this
research
intends
to
introduce
the
traditional
programming
robot
course
into
conceptual
mapping
and
measure
whether
there
are
differences
in
computational
thinking
tendencies
problem-solving
tendencies
and
intrinsic
motivations
between
students
who
use
conceptual
mapping
and
those
who
do
not
use
it
the
students
in
the
experimental
group
with
conceptual
mapping
activities
developed
computational
thinking
skills
during
the
program
robotics
course
the
students
in
the
control
group
first
watched
the
computational
thinking
explanation
video
to
explain
the
computational
thinking
skills
to
the
students
and
then
taught
in
the
traditional
programming
robotics
course
computational
thinking
is
advocated
as
a
skill
that
everyone
should
possess
and
stem
content
and
background
can
be
conducive
to
the
learning
of
computational
thinking
this
study
constructed
a
theoretical
model
of
the
impact
of
stem
courses
on
students’
computational
thinking
and
measured
the
mediating
effects
of
problem_solving
skills
and
stem
attitudes
on
stem
courses
and
students’
computational
thinking
the
study
included
a
questionnaire
of
1870
secondary_school
students
and
a
descriptive
correlational
and
mediating
analysis
the
results
show
that
stem
courses
can
predict
students’
computational
thinking
through
students’
problem_solving
ability
and
students’
attitude
towards
stem
the
results
of
this
study
have
a
positive
reference
value
for
discussing
the
factors
affecting
students’
computational

problem-solving
ability
and
enhancing
students’
attitude
towards

critical
and
computational
thinking
in
primary
and
secondary_education
in
recent
years
shows
growing
importance
in
methodical
approaches
used
in
the
classroom
although
many
examples
exist
for
using
critical
and
computational
thinking
in
stem
educational
area
the
social
sciences
ie
non-stem
areas
were
somehow
left
out
due
to
the
relatively
more
difficult
design
of
such
content
especially
in
the
part
of
the
development
of
computational
thinking
in
that
context
in
this
paper
we
present
one
way
of
using
critical
and
computational
thinking
in
non-stem
education
more
specifically
on
the
example
of
historical
data
sources
through
the
use
of
programming
in
python
as
an
example
we
use
historical
data
for
trans-atlantic
slave
trade
routes
that
were
the
largest
long-distance
coerced
movement
of
people
in
history
up
to
the
mid-nineteenth
century
for
connecting
concepts
of
databases
data
science
and
programming
for
development
of
critical
and
computational
thinking
in
context
of
history
science
this
way
of
using
modern
approaches
in
classroom
should
give
teachers
and
pupils
a
broader
picture
of
importance
of
interdisciplinary
education
for
critical
and
computational
thinking
development
through
stem
and
non-stem
classes
that
give
pupils
novel
skills

market
this
work-in-progress
paper
will
explore
the
effectiveness
of
topic
modeling
to
support
the
analysis
of
colombian
teachers
conceptions
of
computational
thinking
in
spanish
in
an
online
professional
development
program
computational
thinking
has
become
a
form
of
literacy
as
it
can
help
individuals
to
solve
problems
consequently
governments
and
bodies
of
accreditation
worldwide
have
supported
educational
initiatives
primarily
at
the
k-12
level
however
curricular
changes
are
not
enough
teachers
need
to
be
prepared
so
they
develop
the
content
knowledge
associated
with
computational
thinking
concepts
practices
and
applications
in
the
classroom
to
contribute
to
professional
development
opportunities
geared
toward
the
development
of
computational

pedagogical
content
knowledge
the
colombian
national
academy
of
exact
physics
and
natural
sciences
and
the
global
center
for
equitable
computer
science
education
implemented
an
open
online
professional
development
program
for
latin
american
early
childhood
and
elementary
educators
more
than
100
teachers
enrolled
in
a
six-week
online
professional
development
program
to
integrate
computational
thinking
activities
from
early_childhood_education
the
program
included
two
modules
focused
on
conceptual
understanding
of
computational
thinking
in
early
childhood
and
four
more
modules
where
the
participants
adapted
designed
implemented
learning
activities
and
reflected
on
what
happened
during
the
implementation
as
part
of
the
participants
weekly
interactions
the
program
included
a
jamboard
space
where
the
teachers
answered
a
set
of
guiding
questions
just
like
a
discussion
forum
but
as
a
post-it
wall
where
they
could
access
all
their
peers
contributions
and
questions
in
a
single
space
this
study
is
a
systematic
review
of
the
effects
of
computational
thinking
on
students’
academic
performance
from
2006
to
2023
the
main
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
explore
whether
computational
thinking
can
promote
students’
academic
performance
and
the
characteristics
of
such
research
after
literature
collection
and
screening
from
three
databases
a
total
of
mathbf2
3
the
primary
objective
of
this
research
was
to
investigate
effective
learning
sequences
starting
with
computational
thinking
programming
or
both
we
experimented
with
and
analyzed
the
learning
sequence
of
students
from
the
department
of
computer
engineering
information
management
and
mechanical
engineering
the
findings
indicated
that
the
students
of
the
department
of
computer
engineering
possessed
prior
experiences
in
programming
or
computational
thinking
their
learning
sequences
limitedly
impacted
learning
outcomes
conversely
for
the
students
of
the
department
of
information
management
learning
computational
thinking
before
programming
did
not
result
in
better
learning
outcomes
emphasizing
the
need
for
coherence
in
courses
the
students
of
the
department
of
mechanical
engineering
showed
the
practical
value
of
computational
thinking
in
non-it
disciplines
particularly
in
using
specialized
software
such
as
matlab
for
students
with
foundational
knowledge
the
learning
sequence
between
learning
computational
thinking
and
programming
was
less
significant
however
for
beginners
or
those
from
non-it
backgrounds
effective
learning
required
the
coherence
and
integration
of
courses
thus
it
is
required
to
maintain
cross-course
coherence
and
establish
links
between
computational
thinking
and
programming
skills
to
offer
a
more
in-depth
learning
experience
existing
literature
presents
many
cases
of
computational
thinking
analysis
through
the
perspective
of
a
skill
set
for
21st
century
however
it
is
important
to
go
deeper
and
understand
how
computational
thinking
activities
fosters
the
cognitive
development
of
the
young
especially
if
we
want
them
to
have
“a
significant
advantage
in
problem_solving”
becoming
innovative
thinkers
1
to
be
innovative
it
is
necessary
that
a
person
use
sophisticated
cognitive
structures
to
reason
over
abstractions
and
deal
with
hypothesis
these
are
the
characteristics
of
the
formal
operational
thinking
2
therefore
this
paper
is
about
the
use
of
formal
thinking
on
computational
thinking
activities
over
a
digital
fabrication
project
developed
in
a
brazilian
makerspace
poalab
fablab
using
a
case
study
we
want
to
show
that
computational
thinking
and
digital
fabrication
projects
demand
the
use
of
formal
thinking
and
since
that
the
importance
of
designing
learning
activities
for
makerspaces
taking
in
mind
the
possibilities
of
cognitive
development
many
undergraduate
students
in
software
engineering
have
trouble
developing
computational
thinking
several
tools
have
been
reported
in
the
literature
to
support
the
development
of
computational
thinking
this
paper
reports
a
systematic
literature
review
to
present
the
characteristics
that
have
made
successful
web
systems
that
support
the
development
of
computational
thinking
in
recent
years
and
the
reported
limitations
eighteen
primary
studies
were
selected
where
the
strategies
used
are
usually
learning
through
lessons
practicing
with
exercises
working
through
games
and
using
feedback
the
systems
found
have
been
used
at
different
elementary
middle
high_school
and
bachelors
degree
levels
finally
the
main
limitations
reported
in
using
these
systems
were
mainly
the
difficulty
of
the
topics
the
previous
knowledge
that
the
students
should
have
the
attitude
that
the
students
showed
and
the
lack
of
motivation
finally
we
make
some
recommendations
to
software
engineering
curriculum
planners
and
programming
teachers
about
systems
for
developing
computational
thinking
recently
higher_education
has
seen
an
increasing
emphasis
on
the
prominent
role
of
computational
thinking
in
all

is
advocated
as
not
only
a
fundamental
skill
or
concept
in
computer
science
but
also
a
core
competency
for
all
disciplines
teaching
students
in
non-computer

majors
computing
thinking
is
challenging
because
students
do
not
have

investigates
the

that
non-computing
major

in
an

by
measuring
their

the
empirical
result
analyzed
using

of
those

seem
to
have
trouble
using
them

computational

is
taken
for
the
fundamental
skills
for
everyone
not
just
computer
scientist
to
learn
and
use
it
remains
to
be
explored
in
many
aspects
how
to
understand
the
essence
of
computational

and
how
cultivate
the
computational

ability
of
students
in
the
view
of

this
paper
discusses
the
perception
of
the
essence
of
computational
thinking
and
presents
a
method
for
the
cultivation
of
the
computational
thinking
ability
by
using
courses
as
carrier
and
a

the
authors
develop
an
ios
software
“n-queens
problem
for

and
discuss
its
application
in
the
promotion
of
computational
thinking
as
it
has
already
been
pointed
out
in
1
and

playing
games
and
solving
puzzles
are
effective
in
cultivating
computational
thinking
and
our
gaming
software
can
be
a
good
tool
to
cultivate
skills
regarding
“generalization
pattern
recognition”
“abstraction
and
“algorithms”
of
computational
thinking
our
software
“n-queens
problem
for
education”
is
based
on
the
well-known
“the
n-queens
puzzle”
which
involves
solving
a
puzzle
of
placing
eight
chess
queens
on
an
n
×
n
chessboard
so
that
they
do
not
attack
one
another
this
puzzle
is
a
good
way
for
students
to
learn
computational
thinking
since
this
software
shows
the
queens
moves
and
evaluates
solutions
you
can
concentrate
on
using
your
brain
without
writing
down
the
moves
or
erasing
wrong
solutions
in
addition
this
software
has
features
such
as
the
symmetry
operations
of
rotation
and
reflection
of
the
board
that
help
users
study
their
solutions

this
article
aims
to
stimulate
computational
thinking
in
children
from
the
first
years
of
elementary_school
ranging
from
the
1
st
to
the

new
challenges
are
added
with
the
use
of

this
project
aims
to
show
the
importance
of
computational
thinking
and
encourage
teachers
to
make
it
increasingly
present
in
the
classroom
computational
thinking
is
a
type
of
analytical
thinking
that
is
developed
intentionally
that
is
under
a
“learned”
approach
and
the
best
way
to
learn
it
is
through
computer
programming
in
this
paper
the
experience
of
using
block-based
programming
environments
such
as
scratch
lightbot
and
the
pselnt
pseudo-code
tool
for
the
understanding
of
computational_concepts
and
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
is
reported
a
quasi-experimental
methodological
design
was
used
since
it
did
not
work
with
a
control
group
a
mixed
exploratory
investigation
was
carried
out
85
first-year
students
from
the
accounting
professional
school
of
the
national
university
of
san
agustin
de
arequipa
participated
in
the
experience
the
results
show
that
in
introductory
programming
courses
of
short
time
period
teaching
with
block-based
programming
environments
compared
to
the
use
of
pseudocode
with
the
pselnt
tool
facilitates
the
appropriation
of
computational_concepts
and
the
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
thus
obtaining
better
learning
results
it
is
concluded
that
block-based
programming
environments
favor
the
construction
of

firstly
then
we
design
the
teaching
activities
based
upon
the
principles
and
strategies
of
computational
thinking
finally
we
offer
a
real

case
the
teaching
evaluations
from
students
indicate
that
the
teaching
method
based
on
computational
thinking
is
very
effective
as
the
process
of
artificial

progresses
it
is
recognized
that
computational

is
one
of
the
basic
skills
for
understanding
and
solving

and
one
of
the
core
literacies
of
the

algorithmic_thinking
and
can
be
helpful
in
wider
aspects
of

there
have
been
various
approaches
to

however
the
technology
is
still
relatively
new
and
has
not

and
numerous

have
been
created
to

including
many
block-based

teaching
computational

has
received
particular
attention
and
more
research
is
needed
on
using
educational

to
directly
teach
computational

skills
we
propose
to
investigate
this
using
dragon
architect
an
educational
block-based

we
are
developing
specifically
we
wish
to
study
ways
of
directly
teaching
computational

strategies
such
as
divide
and
conquer
in
an
educational
game
as
well
as
ways
to
evaluate
our
approaches
this
paper
is
focused
on
the
teachinglearning
process
of
computational
thinking
at
primary
and
secondary
schools
it
is
generally
accepted
that
programming
is
a
complex
task
that
requires
a
long
learning
process
theoretical
knowledge
about
fundamentals
on
algorithms
and
data
structures
as
well
as
on
programming
languages
are
required
but
are
not
enough
practicing
a
lot
is
also
necessary
however
teaching
computer
programming
is
a
hard
job
most
of
the
times
unsuccessful
to
overcome
all
the
difficulties
felt
by
teachers
and
students
an
increasingly
bigger
community
of
researchers
in
computer
science
is
defending
the
importance
of
teaching
computational
thinking
to
young
students
to
train
them
since
very
earlier
in
logic
and
abstract
reasoning
for
problem_solving
our
starting
point
to
approach
this
topic
relies
on
the
use
of
an
ontology
ontocne
that
describes
in
detail
the
concepts
“computational
thinking”
and
“programming”
and
maps
those
concepts
to
different
education
levels
starting
with
the
first
year
we
believe
that
a
person
just
acquires
a
new
way
of
thinking
or
a
new
way
of
behaving
if
he
is
trained
with
the
appropriate
learning
resources
so
a
main
investment
to
educate
people
in
computational
thinking
is
on
the
choicecreation
of
those
convenient
resources
in
particular
we
intended
to
investigate
the
impact
of
augmented
reality
in
the
usefulness
of
the
referred
resources
in
that
direction
we
will
also
discuss
the
development
of
a
web
platform
to
help
on
collecting
and
classifying
according
to
the
referred
ontology
learning
resources
to
be
used
by
teachers
in
computing
classes
on
the
other
hand
the
platform
will
help
on
the
retrieval
from
that
repository
of
the
most
adequate
resources
to
teach
a
specific
subject
to
a
specific
level
game
design
environments
are
traditionally
used
as
means
for
engaging
non-programmers
in
the
learning
process
however
these
environments
lack
specific
support
for
teaching
computational
thinking
to
novices
typically
such
skills
are
acquired
in
ad
hoc
practical
sessions
with
supervision
provided
by
teachers
or
peers
the
usual
scenario
is
where
a
teacher
guides
the
students
in
solving
these
problems
during
a
game
design
session
in
informal
learning
settings
step-by-step
tutorials
for
creating
existing
games
are
used
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of

moreover
it
is
suggested
that
assessments
independent
of

of
the
study
was
to
analyze
the
effects
of
the
approach
in
the
childrens
motivation
and
performance
a
critical
barrier
in
providing
computer
science
learning
opportunities
to
all
is
the
dearth
of
professionals
who
have
the
expertise
to
teach
computer
science
blended
learning
approaches
have
the
potential
to
reduce
this
barrier
by
facilitating
the
distribution
of
expertise
across
distances
in
this
poster
we
present
our
approach
to
understanding
how
to
design
blended
learning
models
for
the
informal
space
that
take
advantage
of
the
expertise
of
adult
mentors
and
computer
science
experts
our
theoretical
framing
is
based
on
nacu
et
al
2014
adult
mentor
roles
which
suggest
that
adults
play
different
roles
eg
encourager
monitor
broker
to
support
students
learning
we
use
minecraft
a
popular
3d
online
multiplayer
game
as
our
study
context
the
poster
presents
two
studies
that
investigate
ways
of
facilitating
mentorship
in
a
blended
learning
environment
to
teach
computational
thinking
study
1
focuses
on
documenting
the
roles
mentors
play
while
facilitating
a
computer
science-related
minecraft
workshop
with
middle
school
students
study
2
focuses
on
understanding
how
these
roles
are
modified
when
online
and
in
person
mentors
work
together
to
facilitate
a
computational
learning
opportunity
our
initial
findings
suggest
that
defining
a
scalable
model
to
support
blended
learning
models
in
informal
spaces
requires
a
variety
of
mentor
roles
additionally
when
coordinating
mentorship
across
mediums
gaps
in
student
support
can
arise
when
there
is
a
lack
of
a
explicit
strategies
of
communication
in
place
between
in-person
and
online
mentors
and
b
clearly
defined
roles
assigned
to
mentors
technological
devices
programmed
through
parallel
computing
are
increasingly
present
in
peoples
daily
lives
they
are
responsible
for
processing
images
that
we
see
on
computers
televisions
cell
phones
and
games
it
is
a
fact
that
parallel
processing
is
a
reality
so
computer
professionals
need
to
know
the
peculiarities
of
this
form
of
programming
however
teaching
parallel
computing
is
not
a
simple
task
the
computational
thinking
parallel
is
quite
different
from
that
for
the
sequential
processing
this
work
then
proposes
a
new
methodology
for
teaching
parallel
computing
for
young
beginners
in
programming
our
technique
is
based
on
principles
of
unplugged
computing
like
to
learn
doing
and
playing
we
believe
that
unplugged
computing
can
be
very
useful
in
teaching
the
difficult
concepts
of
parallel
computing

hence
the

under
the
guidance
of
output-oriented
and
student-centered

concept
we
analyzed
the

learning
how
to
program
has
become
a
trend
in
taiwan
even
for
younger
students
iot
is
a
topic
to
interest
new
learners
in
programming
given
the
fact
that
there
are
already
plenty
of
tools
eg
microbit
and
arduino
designed
to
make
iot
programming
simple
and
full
of
fun
it
is
usually
believed
that
adopting
iot
topics
is
beneficial
for
younger
students
learning
how
to
program
however
younger
students’
learning
performance
in
programming
courses
varies
dramatically
depending
on
the
tools
mentioned
above
there
are
many
metrics
to
predict
the
academic
achievements
of
young
students
among
them
the
operation
span
is
an
objective
one
operation
span
mainly
assesses
one’s
working
memory
capacity
according
to
the
research
results
one’s
working
memory
capacity
predicts
individual
high-level
cognitive
performance
furthermore
students’
cognitive
performance
was
highly
related
to
their
learning
performance
in

nevertheless
the
relationship
between
operation

as
such
understanding
the

is
crucial
for

in
this
subject
we
designed
an

the
central
problem
we
faced
in
restructuring
our
introductory
course
was
finding
a
game
genre
that
could
support
creative
coding
for
beginners
be
motivational
and
recognizable
by
the
students
and
would
work
with
our

are
an
effective
way
to
provide
scaffolding
and
ease
non-technical
students
into

programming
the
genre
has
good
expressive
power
and
the
students
were
motivated
because
they
recognized

our
motivation
is
that
there
are
no
robust
and
scalable
automatic
methods
for
the
analysis
of

the
approach
to
this
problem
supports
the
improvement
of
pc
development
in
primary

secondary_school
students
the
validation
of
the
method
is
performed
through
the
assessment
of
the
answers
of
primary_school
students
to
programming
exercises
using
a
programming
language
called
lie
the
method
assesses
student
answers
using
several
techniques
such
as
the
analysis
of
programming
structures
code
clones
and
the
execution
of
code
based
on
input
and
output
values
defined
during
the
specification
of
the

it
can
be
concluded
that
the
field
of

which
is
focused
on
two

one
is
to
celebrate

is
aimed
to
present
a

is
aimed
on
those
adults
who
want
to
discover
what
possibilities
scratch
brings
in
the
introduction
to

throughout
this
workshop
an
initiation
to

is
developed
in
the
context
of
educational

as
the
most
significant
results
throughout
the
workshop
it
is
clearly
demonstrated
that
scratch
is
an
ideal
tool
for
children
and

there
is
a
strong
movement
asserting
the
importance
of

all
over
the
world
and
for
students
of
all

many
educators
believe
that
in
order
to
achieve
this
21st
century
skills
must
be
taught
and
that
digital
literacy
should
be
coupled
with
rigorous
computer
science
principles
and
computational
thinking
accordingly
this
work
will
describe
a
didactic
experience
in
an
introductory

and
the
main
conclusion
supported
by
qualitative
and
quantitative
data
the
research
questions
focus
on
understanding
which
is
the
best
medium
to
design
algorithms
by
comparing
flow
chart
and
the
scratch
programming
language
and
by
evaluating
whether
using
textual
language
is
worth
the
effort
of
the
syntactic
burden
imposed
by
these
languages
an
analysis
of
quantitative
and
qualitative
data
revealed
that
both
a
visual
programming
and
a
flow-chart
approach
are
suitable
for
algorithm
design
with
no
statistical
difference
in
terms
of
number
of
errors
and
time
taken
to
write
the
corresponding
code
in
a
textual
language
however
the
high
number
of
errors
suggest
that
using
visual
programming
allows
the
student
to
focus
on
the
problem_solving
activities
robotics
and
computational
thinking
are
ideal
tools
for
developing

stem
pedagogy
today
educational
robotics
tools
emerge
with
the
aim
of
promoting
innovation
and
motivation
of
students
during
the
learning
process
robots
are
becoming
more
common
in
our
daily
lives
therefore
it
is
important
to
integrate
robots
into
all
levels
of
our
society
this
demonstrator
focuses
on
driving
the
same
content
through
three
low-cost
robotic
educational
tools
the
first
is
scratch
where
you
can
schedule
interactive
stories
games
and
animations
the
second
tool
is
crumble
an
easy-to-use
programmable
controller
its
programming
interface
uses
a
block_programming
language
that
facilitates
its
use
finally
arduino
is
an
open
source
hardware-
and
software-based
platform
that
is
easy
to
use
and
has
great
potential
for
developing
robotic
applications
this
demonstrator
aims
to
present
the
above
platforms
as
educational
robotics
tools
as
the
first
step
into
the
world
of
robotics
throughout
this
demonstrator
an
introduction
to
educational
robotics
is
developed
there
is
a
strong
worldwide
movement
which
is
pushing
for
the
teaching
of
serious
computer
science
principles
besides
reading
writing
and
basic
numeracy
starting
from
first
grade
and
reaching
all
students
across
all
grades
this
is
being
done
through
both
formal
initiatives
carried
out
by
international
organizations
and
at
the
national
level
by
putting
forward
curricula
some
of
which
are
mandatory
in
order
to
accomplish
this
goal
and
based
on
the
consensus
that
computer
science
is
not
programming
and
that
programming
languages
are
a
tool
visual
languages
have
become
the
preferred
method
for
teaching
introductory
courses
in
computer
science
the
absence
of
rigid
syntactic
rules
makes
them
the
ideal
tool
for
focusing
on
problem_solving
and
computational

pointed
out
the
need
for

programming
is
a
skill
that
nowadays
is
considered
as
an
important
asset
teaching

is
an
activity
that
becomes
more
and
more
popular
in
the
last
few
years
there
are
great
discussions
on
inclusion
of
coding
in
schools
these
initiatives
impacted
the
policy
makers
in
macedonia
to
include
coding
as
a
part
of
a
new
compulsory
subject
for
the
pupils
at
the
age
of
8
in
this
paper
our
focus
is
on
the
newest
change
in
the
macedonian
curriculum
-
the
introduction
of
the
course
logo
turtles
and
hendersons
picture
language
have
long
been
used
to
teach
computational
thinking
by
inspiring
learners
to
construct
programs
that
create
complex
geometric
designs
we
have
developed
visual
blocks-based
versions
of
these
languages
turtleblocks
and
pictureblocks
that
allow
users
to
transform
their
designs
into
tangible
artifacts
produced
by
laser
cutters
and
vinyl
cutters
our
languages
embody
two
novel
features
first
they
use
constructive
area
geometry
to
convert
the
geometric
designs
generated
by
our
programs
into
formats
suitable
for
laser
and
vinyl
cutters
second
they
leverage
static
typing
and
polymorphism
to
provide
a
new
way
to
reference
the
names
of
procedure
parameters
and
local
variables
in
a
blocks
language
steam
education
is
nowadays
a
key
element
for
our
current
digital
society
integrating
steam
and
developing
competences
such
as
computational
thinking
is
highly
demanded
by
the
industry
and
higher_education
institutions
in
order
to
do
so
new
methodological
approaches
are
required
robosteam
project
is
an
erasmus
project
defined
to
address
these
topics
by
using
of
physical
devices
and
robotics
employing
challenge
based
learning
methodology
one
of
the
first
steps
in
the
project
development
is
the
definition
of
current
landscape
in
the
research
field
which
means
to
carry
out
a
literature
mapping
that
considers
previous
applications
of
challenge
based
learning
in
steam
education
and
use
of
robots
and
physical
devices
to
do
so
this
paper
shows
the
mapping
review
process
and
the
main
results
obtained
the
mapping
analyze
242
candidate
works
from
the
most
relevant
bibliographic
sources
and
selected
54
form
them
it
was
possible
to
see
that
there
are
not
many
initiatives
on
stem
education
related
to
challenge
base
learning
and
the
most
of
them
are
specially
focused
on
the
application
of
specific
tools
and
in
the
development
of
concrete
competences
the
pedagogy
of
science
technology
engineering
arts
and
mathematics
steam
can
be
easily
developed
by
using
robotics
and
computational
thinking
tools
also
inclusion
and
integration
of
diverse
groups
of
students
can
be
promoted
using
these
tools
today
we
can
find
many
tools
for
teaching
robotics
this
kind
of
tools
allow
us
to
promote
innovation
and
motivation
of
students
in
this
way
students
will
be
able
to
work
during
the
learning
process
in
an
innovative
and
motivating
way
since
it
is
increasingly
common
to
find
robots
in
our
daily
lives
it
is
important
to
integrate
robots
into
education
as
well
there
are
already
cooking
robots
autonomous
cars
vacuum
cleaner
robots
in
houses
and
gardens
or
prostheses
this
paper
describes
a
course
focused
on
a
combination
of
teaching
methodologies
educational
robotics
tools
and
a
student
learning
management
methodology
all
within
an
inclusive
framework
to
strengthen
the
presence
of
women
and
other
under-represented
groups
in
engineering
introducing
coding
in
early
education
improves
the
logical
and
computational
thinking
in
kids
however
cognitive
skills
are
not
sufficient
for
a
successful
life
understanding
and
managing
the
emotions
of
oneself
is
another
crucial
factor
in
success
the
current
state
of
the
art
teaching
methods
educates
the
kids
about
programming
and
emotional
intelligence
independently
in
our
opinion
it
is
advantageous
to
teach
kids
emotional
intelligence
along
with
the
programming
concepts
however
the
literature
lacks
the
studies
that
make
students
emotionally
aware
while
teaching
them
programming
this
research
aims
to
prepare
students
to
be
cognitively
healthy
as
well
as
emotionally
intelligent
with
the
hypothesis
that
a
kids
emotional
intelligence
can
be
enhanced
while
teaching
them
cognitive
skills
we
proposed
a
computational
model
that
teaches
programming
and
emotional
intelligence
side
by
side
to
students
the
model
provides
a
curriculum
and
related
tools
for
evaluations
five
hundred
students
of
a
public
school
were
involved
in
different
activities
to
find
the
effectiveness
of
the
proposed
model
these
students
were
divided
into
five
groups
a
b
c
d
and
e
each
having
a
mean
age
of
4
5
6
7
and
8
years
respectively
students
performed
multiple
adaptive
scenarios
of
path-finding
that
were
based
on
self-awareness
social-awareness
sharing
and
empathy
emotions
students
provide
the
programming
instructions
such
as
sequencing
conditional
statements
and
looping
to
a
robot
the
children
have
successfully
improved
in
both
fundamental
programming
constructs
and
emotional
intelligence
skills
the
research
also
successfully
reduced
screen
time
problem
by
providing
a
screen-free
student
interface
educational
digital
storytelling
is
widely
recognised
as
a
powerful
approach
in
developing
literary
skills
experiencing
problem-solving
and
computational
thinking
information
and
knowledge
visualisation
building
creativity
and
divergent
thinking
supported
by
technological
solutions
however
educators
feel
that
they
miss
opportunities
skills
and
tools
to
support
pupils
developing
creativity
hence
we
proposed
a
digital
learning
environment
named
novelette
to
support
both
educators
and
learners
in
performing
visual
storytelling
by
scaffolding
them
in
inventing
and
authoring
stories
the
main
novelty
of
our
approach
lies
in
embedding
literary
artifices
widely
explored
in
learning
settings
into
a
digital
learning
environment
such
as
the
opportunity
to
continue
someone
else’s
story
and
the
suggestion
mechanism
to
explore
analogies
or
synonyms
starting
from
a
word
of
interest
novelette
has
been
ideated
not
only
as
a
learning
environment
for
educators
but
with
educators
as
it
results
from
a
user-centered
and
participatory
design
methodology
to
involve
them
in
the
entire
design
and
development
process
actively
this
paper
focuses
on
the
assessment
of
novelette
usability
according
to
both
educators
and
pupils
as
a
conclusive
step
of
the
co-design
approach
developers
tested
the
resulting
usability
according
to
educators
in
a
controlled
environment
moreover
it
reports
usability
according
to
learners
in
real
settings
at
school
results
demonstrate
that
novelette
is
considered
usable
by
both
target
groups
and
it
is
perceived
as
a
powerful
approach
in
developing
creativity
both
according
to
quantitative
insight
offered
by
the
system
usability
scale
aka
sus
and
qualitative
interpretations
enabled
with
direct
observations
and
structured
after
scenario
questionnaires
we
can
conclude
that
novelette
is
a
pleasant
and
usable
tool
to
invent
and
author
stories
and
seems
to
be
a
promising
approach
to
develop
creativity
game-based_learning
using
interactive
environments
to
impart
theoretical
and
applied
knowledge
for
introductory
programming
courses
is
divided
in
two
popular
approaches
“game
making”
and
“game
playing”
various
studies
have
been
conducted
following
greatly
the
former
approach
in
secondary
and
tertiary
education
with
controversial
results
however
there
has
been
relatively
little
research
shown
about
how
game
playing
can
be
associated
with
the
development
of
computational
thinking
and
how
fundamental
programming
concepts
can
be
supported
by
playing
games
this
work
investigates
how
a
simulation
game
should
be
designed
to
support
the
development
of
computational
problem-solving
strategies
through
the
medium
of
learning
fundamental
computer
science
concepts
by
proposing
a
theoretical
game
playing
framework
from
time
immemorial
stories
have
caught
the
fascination
of
young
and
old
rural
children
in
india
in
particular
have
a
natural
way
of
telling
stories
that
are
rooted
in
their
heritage
of
social
norms
values
and
belief
systems
that
are
compelling
and
emotionally
engaging
the
process
of
writing
and
narrating
their
own
stories
enhances
their
verbal
proficiency
and
makes
them
reflect
deeply
upon
the
story
theme
thereby
enabling
them
to
develop
higher-order
thinking
in
this
research
study
the
author
used
stories
to
introduce
physical
computing
and
robotics
to
children
in
rural
india
in
a
personally
meaningful
manner
children
created
interactive
cultural
dioramas
based
on
classical
stories
from
indian
folklore
with
robotic
puppets
that
they
programmed
using
the
scratch
programming
language
they
learned
21st-century
skills
of
creativity
communication
collaboration
and
critical_thinking
by
working
in
groups
wherein
they
learned
to
divide

work
together
debate
the
pros
and

the
author
observed
that
such
an
intervention
improved
the
childrens
sense
of
agency
and
their
interest
in
robotics
and
computational
thinking
the
author
presents
her
results
from
pilot
studies
conducted
in
2019
from
two
semi-urban
schools
in
india
on
the
childrens
perception
of
creating
robots
programming
tinkering
with
electronics
career
in

and
the
workshop
experience
itself
-
all
of
which
suggests
that
the
children
were
deeply
engaged
and
enthusiastic
throughout
the
workshop
making
the
entire
learning
experience
a
meaningful
and
joyful
one
for
all
the
results
indicate
that
such
culturally
sensitive
interventions
can
help
children
from
collectivistic
cultures
embrace
technology
while
preserving
their
traditional
identities
and
cultural
cohesion
difficulties
in
teaching
and
learning
introductory
programming
have
been
studied
over
the
years
the
students’
difficulties
lead
to
failure
lack
of
motivation
and
abandonment
of
courses
the
problem
is
more
significant
in
computer
courses
where
learning
programming
is
essential
programming
is
difficult
and
requires
a
lot
of
work
from
teachers
and
students
programming
is
a
process
of
transforming
a
mental
plan
into
a
computer
program
the
main
goal
of
teaching
programming
is
for
students
to
develop
their
skills
to
create
computer
programs
that
solve
real
problems
there
are
several
factors
that
can
be
at
the
origin
of
the
problem
such
as
the
abstract
concepts
that
programming
implies
the
skills
needed
to
solve
problems
the
mental
skills
needed
to
decompose
problems
many
of
the
students
never
had
the
opportunity
to
practice
computational
thinking
or
programming
students
must
know
the
syntax
semantics
and
structure
of
a
new
unnatural
language
in
a
short
period
of
time
in
this
work
we
present
a
set
of
strategies
included
in
an
application
with
the
objective
of
helping
teachers
and
students
early
identification
of
potential
problems
and
prompt
response
is
critical
to
preventing
student
failure
and
reducing
dropout
rates
this
work
also
describes
a
predictive
machine
learning
neural
network
model
of
student
failure
based
on
the
student
profile
which
is
built
over
the
course
of
programming
lessons
by
continuously
monitoring
and
evaluating
student
activities
thousands
of
videos
are
posted
online
every
day
the
affordability
of
video
editing
tools
and
social
networks
has
facilitated
the
creation
and
spread
of
videos
carrying
disinformation
ie
fake
videos
previous
attempts
to
categorize
disinformation
have
focused
on
content
analysis
and
ascertaining
the
intention
of
creators
to
extend
these
approaches
it
is
beneficial
to
incorporate
the
perspective
of
other
fields
that
study
the
trustworthiness
of
records
such
as
archival
science
to
help
detect
and
categorize
fake
videos
this
paper
proposes
to
leverage
archival
science
in
combination
with
computer
engineering
to
devise
a
new
framework
for
detecting
and
categorizing
fake
videos
in
doing
so
the
paper
offers
a
case
study
of
the
way
in
which
computational
archival
science
which
blends
archival
and
computational
thinking
can
be
used
to
contribute
to
a
novel
approach
towards
solving
the
problem
of
fake
videos
many
educational
institutions
have
modified
their
curricula
to
include
computational
thinking
and
coding
courses
for
all
students
however
it
is
not
always
easy
to
engage
non-cs
students
in
coding
hackathons
are
often
suggested
as
tools
for
exposing
people
to
fun
real
challenges
promoting
alternative
ways
of
learning
and
increasing
their
interest
in
coding
and
cs
in
general
thus
we
ask
could
a
hackathon
be
used
specifically
within
a
cs1
class
to
motivate
students
and
boost
their
performance
measured
in
grades
in
this
article
we
analyze
data
from
1253
students
before
and
after
an
educational
hackathon
observing
changes
in
motivation
towards
the
class
and
ultimately
the
students’
grades
we
discovered
that
although
there
are
variations
in
motivation
and
performance
on
those
attending
the
pyweekend
either
as
participants
or
attendants
general
public
it
is
difficult
to
conclude
that
those
variations
are
solely
caused
by
the
hackathon
we
also
include
suggestions
as
how
to
extend
this
study
to
further
understand
the
effects
of
hackathons
on
the
motivation
and
grades
of

one
of
the
biggest
challenges
in
education
is
the
transfer
of
innovations
and
new
didactic
approaches
into
the

to
ensure
a
high
standard
of

it
is
essential
that
the

as
well
as
digital

are
continuously
improved

in
different

short-
middle-
and
long
term
with
advantages
and
disadvantages
two
aspects
that
correlate
positively
are
the
costs
and
the
sustainable
outcome
of
these
trainings
with
these
aspects
in
mind
the
educational
pyramid
scheme
eps
is
currently
being
developed
and
implemented
as
part
of
an
erasmus
plus
project
it
is
an
innovative
concept
that
aims
at
spreading
new
learning
contents
and
methods
in
a
relatively
short
time
within
the
school
system
with
low
costs
and
high
effect
it
is
inspired
by
the
economical
pyramid
scheme
which
is
designed
to
create
value
through
the
exploitation
of

the
transaction
content
of
the
educational

scheme
refers
to
methods
or
strategies
that
are
being
exchanged
and
to
the
resources
and
capabilities
that
are
required
to
enable
the
exchange
according
to
a
train-the-trainer
principle
teachers
and
pupils
will
be
qualified
to
be
trainers
who
then
spread
their

this
paper
describes
the
development
of
the
eps
and
its
first
implementation
in
the
framework
of
the
austrian
mandatory
curriculum
the
idea
behind
this
work
is
to
start
exploring
the
application
of
data
analytics
and
explainable
machine
learning
techniques
to
better
understand
games
and
discover
new
features
that
will
possibly
help
in
effectively
exploiting
them
in
different
socially
useful
domains
we
prove
the
feasibility
of
the
idea
by
i
collecting
a
large
dataset
of
board
game
information
ii
designing
and
testing
an
information
processing
pipeline
for
automatically
discovering
game
categories
and
game
mechanics
with
some
first
encouraging
results
in
the
future
we
plan
to
further
generalize
this
approach
for
different
kinds
of
games
and
for
discovering
currently
unknown
but
useful
aspects
eg
games
or
game
features
that
could
better
foster
computational
thinking
in
education
those
better
suited
to
be
applied
in
social
distancing
contexts
and
so
on
whilst
there
has
been
growing
interest
in
the
use
of
social
robots
in
educational
settings
the
majority
of
this
research
focuses
on
learning
outcomes
with
less
emphasis
on
the
social
processes
surrounding
these
interactions
one
such
understudied
factor
is
children’s
trust
in
the
robot
as
a
teacher
trust
is
a
relevant
domain
in
that
if
and
how
children
trust
a
robot
could
influence
their
subsequent
learning
outcomes
the
extent
to
which
the
robot’s
behaviour
including
making
errors
influences
trust
is
yet
to
be
fully
explored
consequently
the
goal
of
this
research
is
to
determine
the
role
of
trust
in
children’s
learning
from
social
robots
we
report
a
pilot
study
investigating
the
conceptualisation
and
measurement
of
chil-dren’s
trust
in
robots
33
children
aged
between
4-9
completed
a
computational
thinking
learning
task
with
a
nao
robot
at
a
science
festival
observations
of
the
interactions
in
terms
of
developing
tasks
and
measurements
for
child
robot
interaction
are
discussed
the
findings
tentatively
suggest
children’s
trust
in
the
robot
can
be
divided
into
two
parts
social
affiliation
towards
the
robot
and
perceived
competencereliability
of
the
robot
nowadays
it
is
increasing
the
importance
of
developing
skills
related
to
the
computational
thinking
at
earlier
stages
of
education
and
the
adoption
of
tools
that
implement
the
visual
programming
paradigm
has
been
well
succeeded
in
presenting
introductory
notions
of
programming
from
kindergarten
to
college
such
tools
allows
the
user
to
program
while
manipulating
blocks
that
represent
programming
languages
instructions
ivprog
is
among
this
class
of
tools
and
was
firstly
implemented
in
java
and
could
be
integrated
to
moodle
using
iassign
due
to
technological
evolution
ivprog
also
evolved
to
ivprogh
and
its
integration
to
moodle
is
still
possible
by
using
the
new
version
of
iassign
that
allow
the
integration
of
html
stack
packages
to
moodle
in
this
paper
we
describe
how
this
evolution
takes
place
and
presents
ivprogh
functionalities
as
well
as
iassign
extension
to
include
html
packages
into
moodle
in
addition
we
give
some
teaching
support
whenever
integrated
using
ivprogh
with
moodle
using
iassign
we
report
on
the
content
and
early
evaluation
of
a
new
introductory

mpct
is
integrated
into
a
freshman-level
program
designed
for
under-prepared
students
with
interests
in
a
stem
discipline
it
is
intended
to
reduce
attrition
rates
by
fostering
student
intuition
in
appreciation
of
and
confidence
about
basic
pre-calculus
concepts
the
mpct
curriculum
is
problem-driven
with
analytical

exercises
that
are
intended
to
motivate

and
to
illustrate
the

are
encouraging
-
students
from

report
that
the

are
fundamental
concerns
in

stem

in
spite
of
this
in
the
chilean
higher_education
system
as
in
most
parts
of
the
world
teaching

is
a
challenging
endeavor
partly
because
the
majority
of

in
stem
undergraduate
programs
have
not
been
introduced
to
the
fundamentals
of
the

and
its

therefore
students
attitudes
engagement
and
autonomous

can
make
a
difference
in
how
students
in
stem
disciplines
in
higher_education
face
their
first

course
in
the
present

we
carried
out

quite
difficult
for

in
this

then
on
the

we
put

this
paper
outlines
a
new
kind
of
degree
that
has
technology
at
its
core
but
is
transdisciplinary
in
nature
rather
than
students
learning
knowledge
in
discrete
disciplinary
blocks
they
are
exposed
to
ideas
and
practices
from
a
wide
variety
of
disciplines
and
use
these
to
create
new
ways
of
working
that
are
underpinned
by
capabilities
in
computational
thinking
complex
systems
data
and
reasoning
in
advance
to
the
present
study
the
authors
introduced
a
method
which
makes
it
possible
to
calculate
the
entropy
of
natural
language
digital
texts
focusing
on
word-processed
texts
presentations
and
webpages
this
entropy
reveals
that
the
more
underdeveloped
documents
are
the
more
demanding
their
content-related
modification
becomes
it
was
also
found
that
the
time
and
data
required
to
complete
a
modification
task
in
an
erroneous
document
is
several
times
more
than
in
its
correct
counterpart
this
finding
leads
to
the
end-user
paradox
the
less
trained
end-users
are
the
more
errors
they
make
and
the
modification
of
their
documents
requires
more
resources
to
resolve
these
discrepancies
the
present
study
defines
the
sustainability
rate
of
natural
language
digital
texts
which
calculates
the
losses
–
the
waste
of
human
resources
time
workspace
computers
energy
frustration
working
in
bees
losing
data
–
generated
by
negligent
text
management
furthermore
we
present
examples
of
how
manual
and
enumerated
lists
behave
to
modifications
in
a
213-page
long
document
and
conclude
from
our
investigations
that
while
the
waste
of
human
and
machine
resources
occurs
repeatedly
in
erroneous
documents
the
sustainability
rate
remains
low
to
prove
the
necessity
of
correction
we
cleared
the
sample
document
which
took
approximately
67
hours
of
two
experts
of
our
research
group
2times67
hours
with
this
method
we
found
that
the
correction
of
errors
can
be
extremely
demanding
but
uses
resources
only
once
and
further
modifications
in
the
now
correct
document
need
only
the
content-required
amount
of
time
activities
entropy
and
resources
in
accordance
with
the
expectations
of
the
person
intended
to
update
the
document
to
correct
documents
we
present
the
error
recognition
model
which
is
proved
effective
and
efficient
in
digital
education
all
our
findings
indicate
that
both
education
and
industry
should
adapt
the
presented
approach
1
to
develop
students’
and
end-users’
computational
thinking
skills
2
to
manage
and
take
advantage
of
errors
3
to
recognize
connections
between
the
structure
of
the
text
and
the
complex
word
processing
tools
4
to
pay
attention
to
digital
sustainability
–
beyond
hardware
and
software
development
and
recycling
–
with
a
focus
on
the
human
factor
recently
the
error
recognition
model
is
a
reactive
problem-solving
approach
whose
effectiveness
is
justified
however
the
near
future
is
to
run
parallel
the
reactive
and
proactive
uses
of
this
approach
while
if
we
look
far
into
the
future
the
proactive
use
to
digital
born
natural
language
texts
should
dominate
as
the
number
of
teachers
teaching
computer
science
grows
it
is
increasingly
important
to
be
mindful
of
the
training
they
receive
with
respect
to
broadening
participation

have
trained
over
50

as
well
as
increasing
awareness
about
the

of
the

with
respect
to

their

for

this
is
in
contrast
to

however

placing
a
limit
on

levels
of

paradigm
this
limitation
is
imposed
by
the

this
paper
discusses
the
idea
of
adding
language
features
to
spreadsheets
enabling
the
gradual
structuring
of
free-form
spreadsheets
to
more
structured
models
we
propose
that
this
concept
is
termed
gradual
structuring
and
is
analogous
to
the
programming
language
concept
of
gradual
typing
in
this
analogy
spreadsheets
take
the
place
of
dynamic
programming
and
structured
modelling
of
static
programming
in
programming
languages
gradual
typing
allows
dynamic
programming
to
be
mixed
with
static
programming
it
is
our
contention
that
dynamic
programming
is
more
learnable
while
static
programming
is
more
expressive
and
abstract
gradual
typing
could
be
used
to
mitigate
the
issues
in
the
teaching
of
traditional
programming
likewise
gradual
structuring
can
mitigate
the
conceptual
limits
that
can
be
taught
using
current
spreadsheets
the
key
language
feature
required
to
enable
gradual
structuring
is
the
ability
to
logically
group
cells
together
so
that
a
single
formula
can
be
applied
to
the
grouped
cells
this
concept
termed
cell
grouping
diminishes
and
can
even
eliminate
the
need
for
the
ubiquitous
and
error-prone
use
of
copy-pasted
in
spreadsheets
moreover
it
makes
the
structure
present
in
spreadsheet
models
explicit
cell
grouping
requires
a
cascade
of
other
new
languages
features
namely
a
more
expressive
referencing
style
which
in
turned
requires
enabling
labels
to
be
moved
to
the
row
and
column
headers
and
the
hierarchical
structuring
of
these
headers
respectively
these
language
features
are
termed
enhanced
referencing
and
semantic
axes
the
ongoing
research
focusses
on
the
usability
and
learnability
of
these
language
features
spreadsheet
applications
exist
that
contain
aspects
of
the
features
mentioned
however
these
applications
do
not
enable
gradual
structuring
and
have
taken
a
mainly
technical
not
human
behavioural
approach
to
evolving
the
spreadsheet
most
countries
in
the
southern
africa
development
community
sadc
have
adopted
national
development
plans
that
recognize
ict
as
the
main
driver
for
economic
development
for
ict
to
effectively
contribute
to
the
national

agenda
however
there
is
a
need
to
ensure
that
citizens
are
ict
literate
as
a
result
a
number
of
countries
have
developed
subject
policy
guidelines
aimed
at
introducing
computer
studies
at
secondary_school
level
while
most
of
these
guidelines
are
carefully
crafted
actual

has
proved
troublesome
having
under-maintained

along
with
inadequately

as
major
obstacles

full
paper
presents
a
literature
review
on
introductory
cs
assessments
as
computer
science
cs
becomes
increasingly
popular
in
the
world
of
big
data
more
college
students
are
taking
introductory
cs
courses
to
follow
the
trend
however
students
have
different
levels
of
exposure
to
cs
when
they
start
cs
in
college
varying
from
no
experience
to
years
of
coding
experience
this
disparity
in
the
amount
of
exposure
can
pose
many
problems
in
the
same
intro-level
class
some
students
may
think
they
do
not
learn
anything
new
while
others
believe
the
professor
goes
through
concepts
so
fast
that
they
cannot
follow
the
pace
cs
professors
may
also
feel
confused
about
how
to
control
the
pace
and
content
of
introductory
courses
therefore
cs
departments
need
an
assessment
to
measure
students’
cs
knowledge
and
then
assign
them
to
the
appropriate
cs
introductory
courses
though
a
vast
number
of
research
papers
discuss
cs
introductory
courses
few
of
them
focus
on
developing
and
validating
assessments
that
evaluate
students’
background

ie

this

aims
to
conduct
a
systematic

to
gain
an
overview
of
the
most
important
introductory

that
need
to
be

understanding
of
introductory
cs
concepts
and
some

by
reviewing
relevant

over
the

15
years
we
selected
48

we
collected

we
found
that

digitization
is
becoming
part
of
almost
everyone’s
life
ranging
from
smartphones

automatically
collecting

to
tools
and

languages
that
are
widely
available
and
easy
to

this
has
recently
been
reflected
in
various
university
curricula
where
courses
such
as
computational
thinking
and
basic
programming
classes
are
now
included
in
a
broader
range
of
non-computer-science
programs
however
these
programs
often
face
challenges
in
such
courses
due
to
their
diverse
student
body
with
students
often
lacking
profound
digital
competencies
and
technical
background
while
gender
diversity
aspects
have
been
broadly
studied
in
the
past
other
diversity
dimensions
such
as
ethnicity
age
or
educational
background
have
largely
been
neglected
thus
far
in
this
paper
we
report
on
our
experiences
in
teaching
an
introductory
programming
course
to
first-year
business
informatics
bachelor
students
after
undergoing
fundamental
changes
in
our
teaching
concepts
and
the
provided
learning
material
we
explore
what
diversity
factors
play
an
important
role
when
teaching
programming
to
non-computer
science
students
and
how
diversity
is
perceived
by
lecturers
and
tutors
our
analysis
confirms
that
a
collaborative
teaching
concept
positively
supports
female
students
and
students
with
language
barriers
computational
thinking
is
an
important
part
of
a
modern
education
and
robotics
provides
a
powerful
tool
for
teaching
programming
logic
in
an
interactive
and
engaging
way
the
robot
garden
presented
in
this
paper
is
a
distributed
multi-robot
system
capable
of
running
autonomously
or
under
user
control
from
a
simple
graphical

actuated
with
leds
and
printed

motors
and
are
deployed
in
a
modular

techniques
to
create
a
scalable

can
be
used
to
teach

the
black

is
a
system
with
the
internal
organization
and

about

the
observer
has
no

however
it
is
possible
to
impact
the
whole
system
via
its
inputs
and
observe
its
reactions
via
its
outputs
the
paper
is
concerned
with
the
implementation
of
“black
box”
type
of
activities
to
teach
computational
thinking
the
main
idea
is
to
give
the
students
the
puzzles
and
ask
them
to
“play”
with
the
inputs
and
observe
the
outputs
enough
to
determine
the
internal
mechanisms
or
principles
that
produce
particular
outputs
from
given
inputs
first
year
students
were
asked
to
define
a
formula
or
describe
a
principle
based
on
which
the
input
transforms
itself
into
the
output
there
were
four
different
types
of
answers
the
student
could
be
able
1
to
state
a
formal

2
to
state
a

3
to
state
a
basic
concept
of
algorithms
or
4
not
to
state
any
type
of
correct
solution
we
found
out
that
a
lot
of
the
students
were
not
able
to
think
about
the
concept
of
the
application
functioning
and
were
not
able
to
create
any
formal
description
of

we
present
an
educational
design
for
an
undergraduate
university
course
meant
to
engage
geography
majors
with
computing
and
computational

for
that
matter
we
use
the
pedagogical
principle
of
contextualization
relating
computing
topics
to
the
discipline
of
geography
using
climate
change
modeling
with
geographic
information
systems
as
a
context
following
a
design-based
research
approach
we
first
present
considerations
and
arguments
that
form
the

then
discuss
initial

and
focuses
on
the
evaluation
of
different

in
a
serious

that
is
developed
for

fundamental
programming
concepts
teaching
programming
is
a
topic
that
has
generated
a
high
level
of
interest
among
researchers
in
recent
decades
in
particular
multiple
approaches
to
teaching
visual
programming
have
been
explored
from
the
use
of
tools
such
as
scratch
robots
unplugged
programming
or
activities
for
the
development
of
computational
thinking
despite
the
wide
range
of
resources
used
students
generally
tend
to
perform
poorly
academically
and
perceive
learning
visual
programming
as
a
complex
and
demotivating
task
in
this
article
the
tutoapp
system
is
proposed
together
with
a
new
methodology
based
on
“learning
by
teaching”
where
students
create
tutorials
on
their
mobile
devices
to
explain
programming
concepts
to
their
peers
the
hypothesis
of
this
article
is
that
the
use
of
this
tool
improves
learning
outcomes
and
the
level
of
student
satisfaction
an
experiment
with
a
pre–posttest
design
has
been
carried
out
with
57
university
students
in
an
introductory
programming
course
30
belonging
to
a
control
group
did
not
use
tutoapp
and
27
belonging
to
the
experimental
group
used
tutoapp
the
findings
indicate
that
the
creation
of
tutorials
with
tutoapp
significantly
improved
students
academic
performance
over
those
who
did
not
use
it
specifically
in
learning
the
loops
and
conditional
control_structures
however
it
was
observed
that
anxiety
increased
in
all
students
while
learning
visual
programming
the
results
of
this
study
open
the
door
to
the
validation
of
the
use
of
systems
and
methodologies
for
creating
tutorials
for
teaching
visual
programming
to
university
students
role-based
collaboration
rbc
is
a
computational

methodology
where
roles
provide
an
underlying
mechanism
to
facilitate
abstraction
classification
separation
of
concerns
dynamics
and

from
a
meta
theoretical
perspective
the
specification
of

is
a
critical
element
of
rbc
in
consideration
of
the
relationships
and
hierarchies
faced
by
groups
roles
and

we
propose
a
minimal
role
playing
logic
system
mrpl
through
substructural
logic
which
is
polynomial
in
complexity
in
support
of
rbc
from

extending
from
it
there
are
three
levels
of
application
ie
the
global

governing
how

to
form
a

the
concatenative
level
for

assignment
with
respect
to

and
the
operational
level
governing
properties

and
structures
that
should
appear
in

can
extend
it

the
effects
of
flipped

on
the
learning

of
primary_school
students
enrolled
in
a
block-based
programming
course
technology
development
has
increased
the
importance
of
information
technology-related
competencies
for
the
new
generation
programming
skills
are
essential
in
various
industries
nowadays
thus
programming
education
has
become
necessary
to
cultivate
students
relevant
abilities
to
meet
the
rapid
pace
of
development
programming
learning
encourages
students
to
think
logically
and
systematically
solve
problems
effectively
and
develop
computational
thinking
skills
however
learning
programming
is
challenging
for
many
students
for
different
reasons
such
as
its
inherent
complexity
inadequate
study
methods
and
pedagogical
approaches
unsuited
to
promote
programming
learning
traditional
teaching
methods
are
often
impersonalized
and
only
suitable
for
some
learning
styles
present
in
class
moreover
the
challenges
encountered
by
the
students
as
novice
programmers
are
attributed
to
their
low
learning
motivation
to
learn
to
program
students
must
comprehend
different
syntactic
conventions
complex
instructions
and
logical
operators
and
actively
engage
in
practical
learning
activities
often
facing
difficulties
this
may
reduce
their
learning
motivation
leading
to
failure
and
dropout
to
accommodate
different
learning
styles
and
increase
students
motivation
this
study
employed
the
arcs
motivation
model
to
design
various
innovative
activities
in
a
flipped_classroom
setting
to
increase
students
motivation
and
improve
teachers
teaching
effectiveness
the
study
utilized
a
pretest-posttest
method
with
two
groups
of
grade
five
students
to
compare
the
effectiveness
of
teaching
and
learning
between
the
flipped
and
traditional
classroom
students
the
studys
findings
revealed
that
the
flipped_classroom
experimental
group
showed
significantly
higher
learning
motivation
than
the
students
in
the
control
group
moreover
it
was
found
that
different
flipped_classroom
activities
including
the
use
of
gamification
flipped
videos
self-study
self-questioning
self-assessment
split
programming
tasks
group
cooperation
and

activities
had
a
positive
influence
on

presents
a
pilot
test
framed
in
educational
robotics
where
parents
and
child
work
together
during
the
same
session
in
recent
years
an
educational
movement
has
emerged
that
is
related
to
the
introduction
of
computational
thinking
programming
and
robotics
in
schools
educational
robotics
is
presented
as
one
more
resource
that
serves
as
a
support
in
the
different
curricular
subjects
and
facilitates
the
emergence
of
skills
such
as
socialization
creative
spirit
and
personal
initiative
allowing
participants
to
find
answers
to
the
problems
that
may
arise
in
their
reality
it
is
for
this
reason
that
a
pilot
test
was
carried
out
where
we
included
the
participants
parents
in
a
session
to
do
this
we
used
the
crumble
controller
a
platform
that
is
programmed
using
block_programming
language
this
platform
also
allows
making
electrical
connections
in
an
amazingly
simple
way
from
the
mechanical
point
of
view
we
use
materials
that
can
be
easily
machined
both
by
children
and
by
inexperienced
people
at
the
end
of
the
experience
the
assistants
completed
the
assembly
of
their
own

the
article
contains
a
study
of
the
state
of
the
art
of
using
educational
robotics
it
also
includes
an
analysis
of
the
different
tools
mostly
used
in
educational

also
throughout
the
article
the
learning
methodology
used
the
different
educational

and
the
results
obtained
from
the

are
described
this
paper
presents
a
proposal
and
an
experience
report
of
an
educational
robotics
course
integrated
to
the
process
of
resocialization
of
youngsters
and
teenagers
in
socio-educational
measures
this
proposal
adopts
a
teaching
approach
oriented
to
the
development
of
comprehension
analysis
logical
reasoning
creativity
and
collaboration
skills
in
order
to
develop
in
these
young
people
real
world
problem_solving
skills
the
main
challenge
of
this
proposal
is
to
favor
the
assimilation
of
the
contents
and
the
development
of
robotics
practice
outside
the
classroom
since
in
accommodation
no
course
material
is
accessible
from
paper
and
pencil
to
robotics
practice
instruments
thus
the
main
differential
of
this
work
is
literally
working
the
computational
thinking
in
spaces
of
deprivation
of
liberty
in
order
to
develop
ideas
for
problem_solving
tasks
the
results
of
this
developed
experience
point
to
excellent
opportunities
for
resocialization
and
professional
orientation
of
young
people
in
socio-educational
measures
through

analyzing
students
perspectives
regarding
the
inclusion
of

in
the

program
of
a

central-european
university
revealed
that
less
than
half
of
the

who
were
at
an
advanced
stage
in
their
studies
felt
sufficiently
prepared
to
impart
digital
competences
in
their
daily
teaching
given
the
importance
of
being
digitally
competent
in
the
modern
digital
era
the
question
arises
how
digital
competences
can
be
sustainably
included
in
the
curriculum
of
a

analyzes
interviews
with
five
faculty

with

didactics
of
geography
in
order
to
identify
best

the
first
author
asked
our

partners
to
provide
insight
into
the
content
they
mediated
the
integration
of
digital
competences
and
tools
in
their
courses
how
their
teaching
could
be
further
improved
and
what
challenges
they
encounter
eventually
we
looked
for
best
practices
and
collected
instructors
thoughts
on
improvements
on
a
curricular
level
and
examples
of
transferring
the
good
practices
to
other
subjects
such
that
future
students
could
benefit
from
a
better
integration
of
digital
competences
for
this
paper
we
analyzed
the
data
with
a
mixture
of
narrative
analysis
and
thematic
analysis
improving
the
mediating
of
digital
skills
and
competences
in
a
wider
range
of
subjects
at
the
university
level
should
eventually
help
students
and
ultimately
their
students
to
implement
digital
know-how
such
as
modern
teaching
tools
into
their
courses
making
teaching
more
effective
and
computational
thinking
as
well
as
related
fields
of
computing
more
accessible
to
academic
as
well
as
secondary
and
younger
students
the
research
so
far
has
shown
promising
results
considering
examples
of
tools
that
can
be
used
on
a
broad
spectrum
of
subjects
and
lead
to
a
factor
of
learned
new
digital
competences
if
used
properly
on
the
other
hand
lecturers
also
warned
about
relying
too
much
on
technology
in
specific
tasks
such
as
orientation
on
a
map
or
analyzing
statistical
data
we
conclude
that
combining
existing
approaches
with
new
more
modern
didactics
can
be
the
key
to
transferring
the
competencies
required
for
our
students

this
document
presents
a
systematic
review
of
visual
programming
tools
for
the
arduino
board
the
arduino
board
is
an
embedded
platform
that
focus
on
enabling
an
easy
way
to
teach
embedded
systems
but
due
to
its
success
it
ended
up
being
used
in
different
teaching
levels
ranging
from
primary
to
university
the
board
was
also
applied
in
the
teaching
of
robotics
and
other
contexts
since
it
is
relatively
cheap
easy
to
program
and
its
community
has
produced
a
considerable
amount
of
free
educational
material
even
though
arduino
is
a
success
it
is
still
maturing
in
terms
of
educational
purposes
aside
the
electronic
knowledge
that
needs
to
be
explored
the
board
is
programmed
by
default
with
c
which
is
considered
not
friendly
to
computer
thinking
beginners
trying
to
solve
this
problem
many
solutions
apply
visual
programming
which
is
proven
to
make
it
easy
for
unexperienced
and
even
children
to
learn
the
basis
of
computational
thinking
in
the
educational
context
with
arduino
even
though
there
are
many
solutions
applying
visual
programming
for
arduino
there
are
no
systematic
review
or
survey
on
this
subject
meaning
that
it
is
hard
to
identify
where
are
the
gaps
and
which
are
the
problems
that
are
already
solved
therefore
on
this
paper
it
was
performed
a
systematic
review
on
the
subject
the
method
found
372
papers
which
31
were
selected
for
full
review
the
reviewed
solutions
where
discussed
and
categorized
we
expect
that
the
presented
results
could
be
used
as
guideline
for

the
area
and
by
educators
and
companies

undergraduate
software
engineering
courses
typically
require
students
to
work
on
team-based
projects
that
reinforce
disciplinary
content
and
soft
skills
at
the
same
time
these
students
particularly
those
at
liberal
arts
institutions
are
required
to
take
courses
that
focus
on
civic
issues
including
on
racial
and
ethnic
inequality
often
students
perceive
these
courses
to
be
outside
their
disciplinary
areas
and
may
not
comprehend
how
these
topics
are
applicable
to
computer

this
paper
reports
on
the
experience
of
pulimood
and
leigey
as
they
and
their
students
grappled
with
issues
of
racial
injustice
in
the
criminal

system
and
drew
upon
their
own

to
apply
computational

principles
to
help
the

better
understand
these

teaching
faces
several
challenges
including
students’
difficulty
in
understanding
abstract
concepts
and
lack
of
motivation
to
address
these
problems
the
use
of
virtual

vr
has
been
explored
as
an
innovative
and
potentially
effective
educational
tool
however
so
far
the

of
vr
applications
and
the
perception
of
their
use
lack
a
clear
and
effective
approach
to
be
used
to
support

the
importance
of
addressing
this
problem
lies
in
the
need
to
improve
the
quality
of

it
is
for
this

that
it
is
important
to
find

this
paper
focuses
on
the
effects
of
gender
and
abstract
thinking
abilities
of
adolescents
on
understanding
computer
programs
also
we
examine
if
there
is
any
difference
in
teaching
between
adolescents
and
college
students
in
order
to
achieve
our
research
goals
we
surveyed
on
the
abstract
thinking
level
and
then
measured
program
understanding
ability
for
300
academic
high_school
students
who
had
learned
c
language
from
this
research
we
found
that
the
abstract
thinking
affects
more
complex
program
understanding
positively
also
we
found
that
the
language
experience
before
learning
brought
the
difference
in
program
understanding
however
we
could
not
find
statistical
differences
in
program
understanding
between
two
genders
from
this
research
we
can
provide
a
new
point
of
view
to
improve
adolescents
programming
ability
with
abstract
thinking
and
gender
factors
there
is
a
saying
“everything
changes
but
nothing
changes”
we
are
realizing
a
rapid
technological
revolution
in
the
development
deployment
and
application
of
computing
technologies
within
every
discipline
and
every
sector
of
society
yet
our
ability
to
respond
to
the
well-documented
need
for
a
large
diverse
computationally
literate
workforce
remains
a
challenge
we
summarize
our
35
years
of
lessons
learned
for
preparing
the
workforce
that
can
inform
efforts
to
address
this
challenge
we
have
pursued
a
multiprong
approach
to
reach
instructors
researchers
professionals
and
students
on
a
national
scale
our
efforts
in
scaling
up
and
sustaining
activities
range
from
teaching
computational
thinking
through
imparting
hpc
skills
we
have
been
able
to
scale
up
these
activities
through
community
efforts
to
share
cooperate
and
collaborate
the
potential
for
providing
life-long
learning
to
everyone
wishing
to
expand
their
computational
knowledge
and
skills
is
greater
than
any
organization
can
achieve
on
its
own
cloud
adoption
in
industrial
sectors
such
as
process
manufacturing
health
care
and
finance
is
steadily
rising
but
as
it
grows
the
risk
of
targeted
cyberattacks
has
increased
hence
effectively
defending
against
such
attacks
necessitates
skilled
cybersecurity
professionals
traditional
human-based
cyber-physical
education
is
resource
intensive
and
faces
challenges
in
keeping
pace
with
rapidly
evolving
technologies
this
research
focuses
on
the
main
advantages
of
incorporating
large
language
models
into
cyber-physical
education
the
chatgpt
platform
serves
as
an
online
tool
to
educate
students
on
fundamentals
cyberattacks
and
defense
concepts
fostering
the
development
of
a
new
generation
cybersecurity
experts
the
proposed
learning
approach
adheres
to
the
chatgpt-assisted
learn–apply–create
model
responding
to
prompts
provided
by
the
learners
the
learning
phase
engages
in
conceptual
learning
the
applying
phase
involves
mathematical
modeling
of
various
cyberattacks
and
the
creating
phase
develops
matlab
program
to
incorporate
attacks
into
sensor
measurements
for
the
experiment
and
entails
developing
the
necessary
attack
detection
approaches
the
effectiveness
of
the
detection
method
developed
by
chatgpt
is
assessed
in
both
the
simulation
and
real-time
scenarios
using
a
j-type
thermocouple
the
impact
of
the
proposed
learning
platform
over
traditional
learning
methods
is
evaluated
through
an
extensive
comparative
feedback
analysis
on
the
learners
foundational
concepts
computational

programming
efficacy
and
motivation
the
study
proved
that
integrating
chatgpt
into
engineering
education
enables
students
to
swiftly
learn
cyber-physical
fundamentals
comprehend
and
model
cyberattacks
create
new
attack
signatures
and
contribute
to
developing
detection
algorithms
such

which
supports
the
sharing
of

can
be
lost
due
to
academic
retirement
when
no

consequently
novice

are
currently
facing
critical
challenges
when
delivering

knowledge
that
relates
to

programming
and
the
development
of
computational

experience
after
a

it
could
be
seen
that
far
too
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
capturing
and
sharing
of
tps
which
are
not
easily
expressed
or
communicated
in

thus
we
design
and
then
demonstrate
a

tpms
which
supports
the
capturing
of

a
quantitative
and
a

shows
that
instructors
are
satisfied
with

improving
their
health
literacy
and
consequently
taking
care
of
their
own
well-being
the
implementation
of
these
activities
in
the
classroom
requires
not
only
the
knowledge
and
skills
of
informatics
and
biology
but
also
the
collaboration
of
teachers
of
both
subjects
these
activities
are
implemented
in
phases
starting
in
biology
lesson
and
continuing
in
informatics
lesson
the
first
activity
tests
the
level
of
sensitivity
of
people
to
colour
differences
the
second
activity
trains
human
adaptation
to
psychological
stress
the
third
activity
is
focused
on
creation
of
compensatory
aid
that
compensates
for
colour

disorder
the
design
and
programming
of
students’
steam
applications
is
a
meaningful
way
to
use
informatics
in
problem_solving
using
and
experimenting
with
these
applications
helps
students
to
better
understand
the
biological

steam
approach
strengthens
students’
orientation
towards
interdisciplinary
studies
eg
bioinformatics
at
the
higher_education
level
and
helps
them
to
be
more

a
new
avenue
for

students
need
to
develop
computational

skills
to
help
make
sense
of
this
data
but
existing
data
science
environments
designed
with
textual

languages
create
a
significant
barrier
to
entry
to
bridge
this
gap
we
introduce
octave
an
end-user

environment
designed
to
help
non-expert
programmers
analyze
spatiotemporal
data
eg
as
gathered
by
a
gps

to
aid
exploration
and
understanding
octaves
design
incorporates
a
high
degree
of
liveness
highlighting
the
interconnection
between
data
computation
and
visualization
we
share
the
underlying
design
principles
behind
octave
and
details
about
the
system
design
and
implementation
to
evaluate
octave
we
conducted
a
usability
study
with
students
studying
construction
the
results
show
that
non-programmer
construction
students
were
able
to
learn
octave
easily
and
were
able
to
effectively
use
it
to
solve
domain-specific
problems
from
construction
education
the
participants
appreciated
octaves
liveness
and
felt
they
could
easily
connect
it
to
real-life
problems
in
their
field
our
work
informs
the
design
of
future

there
have
been
several
explanations
advanced
to

this

paper
describes
the
mathematics
teacher
knowledge
transformation
when
computer

concepts
are
integrated
with

during
the
last
decade
schools
and
educators
made
a
significant
effort
to
introduce

ct
in
k-12
while
this
effort
produced
some
positive
results
in
schools
where
resources
and
specialized
educators
are
available
there
are
school
districts
where
creating
new
classes
andor
hiring
specialized
teachers
is
not
a
sustainable
option
this
creates
a
need
for
teachers
that
are
specialized
in
one
subject
area
to
expand
their
knowledge
into
cs
and
ct
and
teach
these
concepts
in
their

this
knowledge
expansion
and
integration
should
result
in
creating
integrated
curricula
using
their
subject
matter
knowledge
and
the
newly
acquired
cs
knowledge
this
implies
that
the
teacher
should
be
able
to
identify
the
intersection
of
concepts
between
the
two
fields
and
leverage
their
difference
and

to
promote
deep

is
a
three-day
intervention
in
a
graduate

secondary
mathematics
education
methods
course
where
utilizing
math
cs
integrated
modules
we
infuse
cs
concepts
into
mathematics
the
already
known
mathematics
context
reduced
the
cognitive
load
for
familiarizing
the
teacher
candidates
with
cs
and
the
integration
of
the
cs
concepts
provided
a
different
perspective
for
thinking
about
mathematics
and
teaching
after
having
the
teacher
candidates
reflecting
on
the
concepts
of

finally
the

is
considered
the
main
problem
for
first-year

from
the
perspective
of
licentiate
computer

students
and
whether
their

can
improve
their

and
abilities
in
analyzing

a
total
of
16
students

three
professors
from
four
disciplines
participated
in
the

highlighted
important
feedback
from
undergraduate

students
which
provides
an
opportunity
to
apply
their

tries
to
find
out
the
learners
who
needs
help
by
grasping
the
learners’
development
of
understanding
using
tests
that
require
knowledge
however
in
reality
not
many
learners
will
acquire
the
skill
of
writing

this
kind
of
current
situation
implies
that
programming
ability
of
learners
cannot
be
measured
by
tests
that
require

this
paper
focuses
on
not
only
the
knowledge
items
required
for

but
also
the
programming
thinking
computational
thinking
which
is
the
ability
to
combine
the
constituent
elements
of
the
program
in
this
paper
we
propose
a
method
to
estimate
the
learner’s
understanding
from
the
learner’s
process
to
solve
the
code
puzzles
that
require
programming
thinking
as
well
as
knowledge
we
developed
the
interface
to
realize
the
proposed
method
the
experimental
result
with
the

showed
that
the
proposed
method
could
estimate

more
the
push

these
opportunities
have
become
increasingly
present
across
contexts
and
have
expanded
the
possibilities
for
introducing
and
sustaining
student
participation
in

however
while
these
experiences
tend
to
be
effective
ways
for
engaging
new
participants
and
new
forms
of
participation
we
must
be
careful
to
not
overlook
how
’high-stakes’
these
experiences
might
be
for

to
explore
this
tension
this

suggests
that
the

take
steps
to
ensure
that
the
language
and
actions
associated
with

high-stakes
are
reflective
of
learner

and
that
we
design

areas
such
as

highlight
the
need
for
further
discourse
among

these
distinctions
must
be
addressed
before
formalizing

this
paper
also
initiates
efforts
to
integrate

by
bridging
the
cas
and
interpares

emphasizing
the
value
of
complementary
perspectives
from
both
professional

we
argue
that
such
integration
is
essential
for
developing
robust
competency
frameworks
in
archival
education
particularly
within
higher_educations
professional

ai
becomes
increasingly
prevalent
in

offers
unique
opportunities
to
enhance

this
paper
explores
the
application
of
ai
specifically
machine
learning
in
biology
education
through
the
classification
of
edible
and
poisonous
mushrooms
leveraging
a
dataset
of
gilled
mushrooms
from
the
agaricus
and
lepiota
families
this
study
demonstrates
how
ai
techniques
can
be
used
to
classify
species
based
on
morphological
features
such
as
cap
shape
gill
attachment
and
color
the
use
of
ai
not
only
improves
students
understanding
of
species
identification
and
biological
classification
but
also
introduces
them
to
key
concepts
in
data
science
such
as
feature
selection
model
training
and
validation
by
implementing
machine
learning
algorithms
like
decision
trees
and
support
vector
machines
students
can
engage
in
interactive
learning
experiences
that
merge
biology
with
modern
technological
tools
the
results
show
that
integrating
ai
into
biology
curricula
can
foster
both
scientific
literacy
and
computational
thinking
offering
a
more
comprehensive
and
engaging
approach
to

in
this

report
we
present
student
perceptions
of
a
new
first-year
engineering
programming
class
that
was
designed
by
informed
research
practices
while
the
college
of
engineering
at
the
participating
university
saw
a
lot
of
major
switching
in
the
first
year
there
were
not
many
students
switching
into
computer
science
cs
this
could
have
been
because
other
engineering
major
classes
did
not
transfer
well
to
cs
or
that
students
would
be
a
year
behind
in
the
programming
classes
in
either
case
the
participating
university
felt
that
computational
thinking
and
programming
were
an
important
part
of
first-year
engineering
exploration
and
believed
that
all
21st
century
engineering
majors
should
learn
to
program
in
a
general
purpose
language
such
as
python
or
c
past
research
found
that
prior
programming
experience
knowledge
organization
self-efficacy
and
class
size
were
factors
impacting
student
performance
in
early
programming
courses
and
learning
about
programming
enhanced
students
problem-solving
skills
and
improved
perceptions
about

many
other
research
studies
showed
that
the
context
in
which
programming
material
was
presented
to
non-majors
was
important
for
their
learning
and
interest
and
themed
mixed-context
courses
with
real-world

worked
well
therefore
in

12
100-person
sections

this

we
hypothesized
that
engineering
students
would
say
that
the

should
be
required
for
all
engineering
majors
but
we
wanted
to
know
why
we
believed
that
student
prior

experience
engineering
major
and
other
demographics
would
play
a
role
in
their
responses
we
thematically
analyzed
student
justifications
to
identify

themes
and
we
used
a
mixed-method
approach
to
correlate
themes
to
different
student
demographics

major
interest
and

the
majority
of

agreed
that
the
first-year

should
be
required
and
prior

on
the

fundamental
to
computer
science
thinking
like
a
computer
scientist
means
more
than
being
able
to
program
a

it
requires
the
ability
to
abstract
and
thus
to
think
at
multiple
levels
of
abstraction
in
this
talk
i
will
give
many
examples
of
computational
thinking
argue
that
it
has
already
influenced
other

and
promote
the
idea
that
teaching
computational

can
not
only
inspire
future
generations
to
enter
the
field
of
computer
science
but
benefit
people
in
all
fields
information
technologies
are
the
base
of
the

infrastructure
in
this
social
context
education
like
any
productive
or
service
sector
is
affected
by
technology
faced
with
this
reality
educational
systems
must
prepare
our
young
people
to
live
in
the
digital
world
for
which
they
must
be
proficient
in
a
new
language
without
which
they
will
become
digital
illiterates
therefore
in
school
we
should
not
only
train
in
linguistic
and
numerical
literacy
but
also
in
digital
literacy
so
far
the
effort
has
been
oriented
mainly
to
convert
our
young
people
into
users
of
computer
tools
this
has
gone
from
being
necessary
to
being
insufficient
because
the
use
of
software
applications
means
to
manage
a
digital
language
that
is
obsolete
in
a
time
that
is
not
proportional
in
effort
to
the
time
that
has
been
invested
in
acquiring
these
skills
therefore
the
challenge
is
to
prepare
our
young
people
to
face
the
world
in
which
they
live
giving
them
the
necessary
cognitive
tools
to
succeed
in
the
digital
world
that
is
instead
of
teaching
students
only
the
syntax
of
a
changing
language
they
should
be
instructed
in
the
rules
that
allow
them
to
know
how
the
digital
language
is
constructed
thus
computational
thinking
emerges
as
a
paradigm
of
work
and
the
programming
is
stablished
as
the
tool
to
solve
problems
summary

different
motivations
different
approaches
to
the
task
of
programming
and
different
expectations
about
the
outcomes
this
talk
reports
results
from
a
10
year
programme
of
research
engaging
with
collaborators
who
have
been
sought
out
precisely
because
their
motivations
work
methods
and
intentions
are
as
different
as
possible
from
typical
engineering
programmers
these
investigations
have
involved
the
development
of
a
wide
range
of
novel
programmable
systems
and
notations
designed
for
use
by
choreographers
composers
musicians
and
visual
artists
the
findings
extend
previous
analyses
of
computational
experience
such
as
the
attention
investment
model
of
abstraction
use
and
the
cognitive
dimensions
of
notations
drawing
attention
to
ways
of
programming
that
are
not
only
utilitarian
but
playful
and
engaging
research
of
this
kind
also
helps
us
to
understand
that
there
are
not
necessarily
different
kinds
of
people
in
the
world
-
those
who
are
creative
or
not
-
but
rather
different
ways
of
engaging
with
technology
available
to
all

how
the

arent
only
reflections

and
now
find
ourselves
in

there
have
been
many
periods
in

history
when
we
have
asserted
that
it
was
possible
to

be
known
ignoring
the
pragmatic
reality
of

an
ever-expanding

one
must
understand
that
such
a

is
further
complicated
by
cultural

situational
bias
what

important
in

the
concept
of
computational
thinking
is
timely
it
is
widely
agreed
that
in
order
to
benefit
and
thrive
in
a
digital
world
more
than
digital
literacy
is
required
computational
thinking
promises
understanding
of
information
technology
and
its
utilization
without
necessarily
knowing
how
to
write
code
according
to
many
authors
skills
in
computational
thinking
include
the
ability
to
evaluate
and
design
solutions
to
problems
however
the
vision
for
computational
thinking
laid
out
by
a
number
of
scholars
is
even
bigger
than
this
it
proposes
that
thinking
habits
from
computer
science
are
beneficial
for
any
kind
of
problem_solving
and
that
those
thinking
habits
form
a
central
part
of
modern
sciences
it
might
be
that
components
of
computational
thinking
are
indeed
useful
in
problem_solving
and
that
they
play
an
important
part
in
other
sciences
however
computer
science
combines
three
types
of
thinking
traditions
theoretical
mathematical
tradition
engineering
tradition
and
scientific
tradition
and
it
is
important
to
differentiate
between
what
is
an
aspect
in
one
or
more
of
these
traditions
and
what
is
unique
for
computer
science
this
clarification
will
support
the
application
and
teaching
of
computational
thinking
this
paper
explores
the
uniqueness
of
computational
thinking
and
its
roots
in
theoretical
engineering
and
scientific
traditions
of
computing
with
the
introduction
of
computer
programming
in
schools
around
the
world
scratch
has
risen
in
prominence
for
its
thinkable
meaningful
and
social
aiming
to
assessing
the
computational
thinking
skills
of
a
scratch
program
we
design
and
implement
a
new
scratch
program
analysis
tool
based
on
antlr
to
solve
some
flaws
eg
high
failure
rate
and
low
efficiency
in
dr
scratch
which
is
the
most
relevant
tool
to
assess
computational
thinking
skills
of
scratch
programs
we
choose
the
recognition
tool
antlr
to
design
the
system
module
and
the
assessing
flow
and
then
we
customize
more
than
200
lexical
and
syntax
parser
rules
in
antlr
furthermore
we
expand
the
grading
standard
of
assessing
computational
thinking
skills
in
dr
scratch
some
fundamental
concepts
in
computer
science
such
as
stack
queue
and
recursion
method
are
involved
in
our
grading
standard
experiment
results
show
the
performance
eg
success
rate
execution
time
of
sat
is
superior
to
that
of
dr
scratch
in
recent
years
engineering
education
has
become
one
of
the
challenging
issues
in
thailand
education
by
teaching
and
learning
subjects
independently
students
are
limited
to
subject-oriented
problems
which
are
not
in
reality
to
address
these
flaws
integrating
knowledge
across
disciplines
becomes
significantly
necessary
in
the
past
years
stem
has
been
accepted
as
one
of
the
effective
strategies
to
bridge
the
difference
in
nature
of
each
field
to
construct
more
practical
projects
and
innovations
moreover
the
educational
robot
can
be
employed
as
a
learning
tool
in
that
strategy
since
it
not
only
provides
challenging
learning
missions
but
also
promotes
computational
thinking
for
the
students
therefore
this
research
study
proposed
stem
learning
activities
on
three-day
workshop
to
lay
out
the
foundation
to
the
high-school
science-and-technology
students
who
are
becoming
the
engineering
students
the
workshop
comprises
of
eight
phases
to
facilitate
their
learning
inquiry
process
with
hands-on
experience
moreover
the
activities
were
designed
in
consideration
of
promoting
computational
thinking
with
challenging
learning
missions
the
findings
of
this
study
showed
that
the
proposed
workshop
activities
are
beneficial
for
the
students
who
outperformed
on
robotics
with
higher
computational
thinking
meanwhile
they
could
provide
more
relevant
responses
regarding
the
proposed
learning
activities
fundamental
skills
acquired
by
undergraduate
students
during
their
academic
play
a
crucial
role
in
their
career
one
such
skill
is
computational
thinking
ct
which
will
help
to
solve
problems
algorithmically
using
computers
computational
thinking
will
improve
their
problem_solving
skills
in
a
non-conventional
manner
as
this
leads
the
student
to
think
in
multiple
paths
to
reach
the
solution
however
it
is
a
challenge
in
computing
education
to
develop
students
ability
to
solve
problems
in
an
algorithmic
way
the
aim
of
this
paper
is
to
introduce
a
potential
and
pragmatic
approach
to
develop
computational
thinking
skills
in
novices
recent
trends
in
science

stem
education
are
focused
on
developing
problem-solving
skills
and
computational

and
empowering
students
with
the
stem
disciplines
knowledge
to
solve
real-world

stem
incorporates
an
interdisciplinary
approach
that
includes
inquiry

and
cooperative

technological
advancements
are
offering
new
ways
to
integrate
new
tools
such
as
drones
robotics
and
gaming
in
teaching
and
learning
practices
and
modify
the
pedagogical
approaches
that
are
more
appealing
and
engaging
this
paper
presents
an
innovative
pedagogical
approach
and
practice
that
integrate
drone
technology
and
block-based
programming
to
foster
students
computation
thinking
in
a
stem
context
the
block-based
visual
programming
languages
provide
an
interactive
environment
to
connect
the
blocks
and
write
programs
the
study
was
conducted
in
six
australian
schools
students
were
assigned
projects
to
automate
drones
using
the
droneblocks
app
and
make
programs
to
fly
the
drone
in
different
geometrical
patterns
straight
line
arch
rectangle
triangles
and
zig-zag
and
integrate
the
various
manoeuvres
bounce
8d
flips
and
throw
go
along
flight
paths
students
computational
thinking
development
was
examined
with
an
emphasis
on
their
performance
in
formulating
and
problem-solving
results
have
shown
that
integrated
drone
and
programming
pedagogy
contributed
significantly
to
students
learning
of
developing
computational
thinking
for
problem-solving
and
decomposing
a
problem
into
smaller
parts
in
a
sequence
that
includes
mathematical
algorithms
to
write
programs
studies
with
augmented
reality
show
that
while
the
technology
helps
the
student
learn
it
may
end
up
disturbing
other
points
showing
that
more
research
is
needed
with
the
use
of
augmented
reality
also
a
topic
that
is
growing
within
education
is
computational
thinking
which
says
that
the
thinking
like
computer
scientists
is
necessary
for
the
21st
century
and
should
be
disseminated
mainly
in
schools
during
basic
education
in
the
face
of
this
this
work
created
an
augmented
reality
android
application
that
tracks
physical
tiles
and
creates
3d
maps
for
the
user
also
giving
a
character
that
can
be
programmed
to
walk
on
this
created
map
simulating
a
programming
toy
finally
tests
carried
out
with
the
application
have
shown
that
augmented
reality
currently
has
performance
problems
when
multiple
targets
are
used
so
devices
with
low
processing
have
problems
at
map
tracking
these
issues
affected
the
tests
with
the
children
which
made
it
difficult
for
them
to
track
the
map
like
they
wanted
but
they
still
liked
the
app
even
after
it
that
shows
that
the
acceptance
of
the
technology
by
the
children
is
good
which
can
help
developing
computational
thinking
but
the
technology
limitation
is
still
a
problem
these
obstacles
while
currently
hindering
the
use
of
augmented
reality
in
education
may
in
the
future
be
irrelevant
due
to
the
constant
advancement
of
technology
this
papers
main
contribution
is
showing
one
possibility
of
using
ar
with
computational
thinking
and
what
needs
to
evolve
for
it
to
be
used
by
the
usable
by
the
children
complex
problem_solving
is
one
of
the
key
skills
for
future
jobs
but
it
has
not
been
clearly
operationalized
we
hypothesized
that
it
is
a
construct
of
inquiry
computational
thinking
and
mathematical
problem_solving
the
hypothesis
was
empirically
tested
by
administering
tests
to
261
high_school
students
for
assessing
three
inquiry
skills
two
dimensions
of
computational
thinking
and
five
mathematical
problem_solving
skills
confirmatory_factor_analysis
showed
a
three
factor
model
of
inquiry
skills
and
two
factor
model
of
computational
thinking
skills
to
have
a
good
fit
mathematical
problem_solving
skills
were
characterized
with
a
two
factor
model
these
factors
were
combined
in
a
higher-order
factor
model
into
one
construct
that
could
be
defined
as
a
complex
problem_solving
skill
this
article
is
intended
to
present
a
systematic
review
of
the
development
of
computational
thinking
in
the
regular
basic
education
of
south
american
countries
for
this
study
the
following
topics
were
investigated
educational
studies
and
policies
methodologies
designed
for
the
teaching
of
computational
thinking
languages
and
tools
used
and
the
techniques
or
methods
for
assessment
of
computational
thinking
in
the
regular
basic
education
both
computational
thinking
and
practical
thinking
are
important
concepts
of
great
concern
to
the
international
computer
community
they
are
also
hot
topics
needed
to
be
studied
in
education
inspired
by
these
two
kinds
of
thinking
we
expound
how
to
better
carry
out
teaching
practice
the
teaching
process
is
task-oriented
teacher-led
and
student-centered
in
the
whole
teaching
process
teachers
use
the
way
of
integrating
computational
thinking
with
practical
thinking
to
prepare
courses
design
tasks
and
guide
students
to
complete
learning
tasks
compared
with
the
traditional
teaching
mode
the
teaching
mode
of
integrating
computational
thinking
and
practical
thinking
has
made
great
progress
in
training
students
computer
practical
ability
and
innovation
ability
it
can
not
only
improve
learning
efficiency
but
also
train
students
computer
practical
ability
finally
the
feasibility
and
efficiency
of
this
method
are
verified
by
java
web
course
design
due
to
the
international
and
domestic
education
and
computer
industries
and
so
on
computational

computational
thinking
has
become
a
interesting
subject
and
important
concept
in
education
throughout
the
nation
computational
thinking
ct
has
been
defined
as
an
important
skill
as
digital
literacy
that
must
be
learned
by
next
generation
along
with
the
need
to
make
an
agreed
definition
of
ct
many
countries
are
still
in
the
process
of
or
have
not
started
introducing
ct
into
the
curriculum
at
all
levels
of

it
was
also
found
in

could
be
the
most
obvious
place
to
teach
ct
has
not
been
the
main

this
research
aim
is
to
design
an
alternative
ct
learning

to
study
interestingly
and
effectively
computational

which
consists
of
4

application
product
is
equipped
with
an
educational
game
based
on
computational

the
media
has
several
features
such
as
presentation
of
material
and
examples
of
problems
and
the
solution
and
small
challenges
in
a
games
consisting
of
3
stages
the
subjects
of
this
study
were
students
of
k-12
the
data
used
for

was
collected
in
several
ways
including
observation
questionnaire
pre-test
and
post-test
in
similar
question
the
result
is
the
use
of
ct
learning

is
very
helpful
to
improve
students
understanding
of
ct
in
problem_solving
even
in
different
topics
with
the
coming
of
the
digital
intelligence
era
contemporary
middle
school
students
should
have
the
key
literacy
and
ability
to
quickly
adapt
to
the
current
social
development
computational
thinking
as
a
critical
problem-solving
skill
in
the
era
of
artificial
intelligence
has
also
become
a
basic
literacy
for
students
to
face
the
future
however
the
traditional
“duck
and
filler”
teaching
mode
is
ineffective
in
developing
computational
thinking
skills
while
the
gamified
learning
approach
allows
learners
to
interact
with
games
in
an
immersive
way
therefore
this
study
combines
games
and
programming
teaching
builds
a
teaching
model
of
gamified
text
programming
and
develops
a
series
of
programming
courses
it
can
develop
not
only
computational
thinking
skills
and
improve
students
programming
ability
but
also
effectively
avoid
the
limitations
of
traditional
programming
teaching
with
the
development
of
digital
technologies
teaching
computational
thinking
and
relative
skills
in
the
k-12
curriculum
can
benefit
students
in
thinking
and
create
in
the
digital
area
this
study
designed
a
programming
course
to
help
students
develop
computational
thinking
and
relative
skills
and
conducted
a
practice
in
a

however
there
is
currently
no

and
it
is
considered
as
an
important
way
to
carry
out
university
computer

reform
this
paper
firstly
analyzes
the
existing
problems
in
university
computer
teaching
for
non-computer
majors
and
then
it
discusses
a
series
of
teaching
practices
that
integrate
computational

into
university
computer
teaching
including
1
students
are
divided
into
different
classes
according
to
their
computer
proficiency
2
we
abandon
the
concept
of
“narrow
instrumentalism”
and
teach
the
most
essential
knowledge
of
computer
foundation
3
we
propose
the
“data”
as
the
mainline
and
then
reconstruct
teaching
content
according
to
the
mainline
4
we
also
reconstruct
experimental
content
with
the
mainline
and
separate
experimental
teaching
into
a
single
course
the
practices
has
proved
that
the
teaching
methods
put
forward
in
this
paper
yield
good
results
and
it
provides
a
new
model
for
university
computer
foundation
teaching
which
aims
at
improving
students’
computational
thinking
computational
thinking
is
one
of
the
fundamental
skills
of
the
21st
century
and
will
be
a
necessary
part
of
all
future
work
so
it
is
essential
that
children
learn
it
in
school
one
way
to
work
on
computational
thinking
is
through
data
visualization
this
paper
presents
the
motivation
design
and
implementation
of
a
platform
called
alfadatizando
through
which
it
is
possible
to
work
with
data
visualization
activities
to
promote
the
skill
of
computational
thinking
in
digital
humanities
alfadatizando
allows
the
creation
resolution
and
feedback
of
data
visualization
activities
without
the
need
to
use
another
platform
it
also
allows
sharing
didactic
sequences
and
data
sources
with
the
educational
community
registered
in
the
platform
alfadatizando
is
still
in
an
early
stage
of

steam
education
and
computational

emphasize
interdisciplinary
integrated
learning
however
the
steam

scheme
designed
for
the
art
domain
is
limited
therefore
this
study
develops
an
interactive
picture
storybook
scheme
for
lower-grade
elementary
students
to
learn
music
and
computational

it
combines
picture

to
provide

with
interactive
digital

that
offers
interactive

and
hands-on
activities
enhancing

project
targeting
disadvantaged

as
we
shift
to
emphasize
computational

more
explicitly
we
speculate
that
these
skills
could
complement
and
perhaps
eventually
displace
some
elements
of
maths
as
the
dominant
driver
of

the
confluence
of
better
tools
open
service

and
the
rapid
spread
of
handsets
and

into
marginalized

is
an
opportunity
to
build
more
widespread
computational

this
could
in
turn
facilitate
a

here
who
engaged
me
in
edifying
conversations
about

the
development
of
computational

skills
through
computer
programming
is
a
major
topic
in
education
as
governments
around
the
world
are
introducing
these
skills
in
the
school
curriculum
in
consequence
educators
and
students
are
facing
this
discipline
for
the
first
time
although
there
are
many
technologies
that
assist
teachers
and
learners
in
the
learning
of
this
competence
there
is
a
lack
of
tools
that
support
them
in
the
assessment
tasks
this
paper
compares
the
computational

score
provided
by
dr
scratch
a

software
assessment
tool
for

with
mccabes
cyclomatic

metrics
two
classic
software
engineering
metrics
that
are
globally
recognized
as
a
valid
measurement
for
the
complexity
of
a
software

the
findings
which
prove
positive
significant
moderate
to
strong
correlations
between
them
could
be
therefore
considered
as
a
validation
of
the
complexity
assessment
process
of
dr

in
recent
years
we
are
witnessing
movements
around
the
world
to
bring
computer
programming
to
schools
lots
of
these
initiatives
however
have
been
conceived
to
address
the
shortage
of
professionals
in
the
technology
sector
an
approach
that
is
encouraged
by
the
software
industry
on
the
contrary
this
article
argues
that
the
focus
should
swift
towards
computational
thinking
an
ability
that
goes
far
beyond
computer
science
or
technology
fostering
fundamental
skills
for
the
citizens
of
the
twenty-first
century
in
this
paper
we
summarize
the
findings
of
recent
investigations
that
study
computational
thinking
from
different
perspectives
explaining
what
this
new
skill
is
made
of
presenting
outcomes
of
school
interventions
showing
relationships
between
the
development
of
this
ability
and
improvements
in
different
subjects
and
soft
skills
presenting
technologies
to
foster
its
development
and
reviewing
tools
that
support
educators
in
the
assessment
of
this
skill
the
aim
of
this
paper
is
to
discuss
the
importance
of
computational
thinking
and
how
to
include
techniques
to
teach
this
kind
of
ability
in
schools
in
brazil
first
we
discuss
what
computational
thinking
is
and
the
importance
of
teaching
such
skill
in
school
then
we
list
some
of
the
challenges
that
are
involved
in
introducing
this
discipline
in
school
curricula
programming
is
one
of
the
key
assets
in
the
modern
society
in
addition
to
teaching
programming
to
future
programmers
it
has
become
more
and
more
important
to
teach
it
alongside
computational
thinking
to
all
students
we
designed
and
implemented
a
programming
course
aimed
for
teacher
students
at
our
university
the
goal
of
the
course
was
to
teach
programming
computational
thinking
and
the
methods
and
tools
used
in
programming
education
the
course
was
divided
into
two
parts
first
the
students
were
taught
basic
programming
skills
by
utilizing
tutorial-based
learning
with
automatically
assessed
electronic
exercises
and
play-based
programming
tasks
in
the
second
part
the
students
utilized
the
acquired
skills
by
teaching
programming
integrated
into
mathematics
to
children
at
elementary_school
level
the
students
worked
really
hard
throughout
the
course
completing
more
than
90
of
all
tasks
in
average
moreover
the
feedback
from
the
tutorial
sessions
and
the
practice
lessons
at
schools
was
mainly
positive
this
work-in-progress
study
focuses
on
computational
thinking
ct
in
children
women
minorities
and
persons
with
disabilities
are
currently
underrepresented
in
stem
education
and
careers
however
providing
appropriate
early
ct
learning
opportunities
can
potentially
help
learners
develop
both
interest
and
self-efficacy
in
computer
science
and
stem
fieldsour
research
aims
to
characterize
computational
thinking
and
engineering
thinking
for
k-2
aged
children
in
this
paper
we
report
on
our
findings
of
children
exploring
a
recently
installed
exhibit
at
a
local
midwestern
science
center
the
exhibit
was
designed
to
help
children
learn
about
engineering
careers
and
ct
and
provides
different
learning
activities
to
elicit
ct
in
children
from
diverse
learning
groups
the
exhibit
provides
information
about
different
engineering
disciplinesfields
and
examples
of
engineers
from
diverse
groups
ie
it
includes
images
of
people
of
different
races
ethnicities
gender
and
abilityin
this
study
we
audio-
and
video-recorded
families
while
they
explored
the
exhibit
they
then
participated
in
interviews
and
completed
surveys
the
video
data
provided
evidence
that
children
can
engage
in
a
range
of
ct
competencies
in
the
computer-supported
coding
game
our
findings
can
help
us
further
consider
how
families
can
support
children
as
they
learn
ct
skills
in
out-of-school
environments
identifying
engaging
programming
tasks
to
teach
computational
thinking
and
programming
skills
especially
to
students
of
post-secondary_education
is
a
challenging
problem
for
lecturers
physical
computing
is
a
potential
solution
that
provides
ample
opportunities
for
creative
development
of
such
skills
the
availability
of
pre-assembled
physical
computing
tool
kits
often
do
not
offer
the
right
level
of
abstraction
and
flexibility
to
suit
educators
needs
consequently
this
paper
presents
the
design
of
a
custom
physical

th
some
curriculum
of
making
computer
games
were
developed
to
engage
students
in
digital
game-making
activities
so
as
to
enhance
their
computational
thinking
skills
during
the
last
few
years
the
findings
of
those
studies
are
quite
positive
especially
concerning
the
promotion
of
computational
thinking
skills
however
many
students
seem
to
face
difficulties
in
the
processes
of
the
game
development
such
as
debugging
applying
mathematics
or
physics
subjects
additionally
students
often
have
solved
the
problems
and
understood
concepts
mainly
math
formulas
and
physics
concepts
alone
while
creating
their
games
this
study
presents
an
innovative
curriculum
design
that
suggests
two
students
playing
different
role
to
make
motion-based
touchless
games
ie
games
that
are
based
on
natural
user
interaction
technologies
like
the
microsoft
kinect
camera
or
leap
motion
based
on
the
requirements
of
the
innovative
curriculum
and
interaction
technologies
students
can
naturally
fulfill
the
ideal
of
pair_programming
and
get
various
benefits
from
each
other
with
the
rapid
development
of
information
and
educational
technology
computational

has
become
one
of
the
basic
qualities
and
abilities
that
all

should
possess

also
serves
to
introduce
transversely

to
many
students
of

and
moodle
as
the
learning
platform
at
present
the
course
is
being
implemented
in
public
schools
in
the
dominican
republic
the
essence
of
computational
thinking
is
thinking
about
data
and
ideas
and
using
and
combining
these
resources
to
solve
problems
the
internal
requirement
of
the
programming
courses
is
to
cultivate
the
students
the
ability
to
use
programming
language
for
problem
analysis
and
problem_solving
according
to
the
characteristics
of
the
courses
themselves
this
paper
proposes
a
course
teaching
system
built
on
the
core
of
computational
thinking
ability

and
related
reform
method
which
emphasizes
the
problem_solving
and

and
determines
the
relationship
between
object-oriented
method
and
procedure-oriented
method
in
theoretical
teaching
and
designs
multi-layer
experiments
and
project-based

organization
this
teaching
strategy
proves
effective
through
teaching
practice
the
need
to
attract
learners
and
improve
retention
in
computational
thinking
classes
has
never
been
greater
than
presently
alarmingly
research
suggests
that
the
relative
popularity
of
computer
science
in
k-12
and
colleges
is
not
increasing
while
other
stem
subjects
are
witnessing
substantial
rise
in

moreover
more
than
one
third
of
those
who
choose
computer

drop
out
or
fail
the
first

class
dashing
hopes
of
building
a
computationally
savvy
workforce
for
the
emerging
global
economy
in
this
paper
we
introduce
a
novel
social

system
called
openschool
for

alike
which
is
able
to
double
as
a

assessed
a
20-hour
professional
development
program
with
21
teachers
from
public
middle

in
antioquia
colombia
the
program
introduced
the
concepts

and
discussed
why
these
are
relevant
for

learning
process
at
the
end
of
the

the
teachers
completed
a
survey
regarding
their

preliminary
results
indicate
that
the
participating

increased
their
knowledge
and
interest
to
integrate
computational

the

an
important
core
course
for

however
the
traditional

method
only
focuses
on
the
teaching
of
technical
knowledge
but
ignores
the
importance
of

ability
in
order
to
develop

the
computer
science
industry
suffers
from
a
significant
gender
gap
this
situation
likely
hinders
the
creation
of
inclusive
and
user-friendly
systems
due
to
a
bias
in
perspectives
to
narrow
this
gender
gap
this
study
investigates
how
females
program
to
increase
interest
in
computer
sciences
specifically
60
open
scratch
projects
on
the
web
are
analyzed
to
clarify
differences
in
the
computational
thinking
scores
with
respect
to
gender
the
difference
in
the
computational
thinking
score
by
gender
suggests
that
the
gap
may
be
due
to
the
lack
of
the
synchronization
element
in
female
users’
projects
a
deeper
understanding
of
how
people
program
based
on
gender
should
support
creating
an
effective

environment
and
allow
educators
to
create

materials
that
attract
both
genders
equally
into

as
part
of
this
initiative
we
develop
computational

we
made
our
puzzles
accessible

our
research
reveals
that
the
traditional
surface
approach
methods
for
teaching
spreadsheeting
do
not
provide
long
lasting
reliable
knowledge
which
would
provide
students
and
end-users
with
effective
problem-solving
strategies
while
sprego
does
beyond
this
finding
the
project
proves
that
sprego
supports
schema
construction
and
extended
abstraction
which
is
one
of
the
major
hiatus
points
of
traditional
surface
navigation
methods
the
project
also
reveals
that
developing
computational
thinking
skills
should
not
be
downgraded
and
the
misconceptions
of
self-taught
end-users
and
user-friendly
applications
should
be
reconsidered
especially
their
application
in
educational
environments
gaining
effective
computer
problem-solving
skills
and
knowledge-transfer
abilities
is
not
magic
but
a
time-consuming
process
which
requires
consciously
developed
and
effective
methods
and
teachers
who
accept
the
incremental
nature
of
the
sciences
nowadays
the
ability
to
code
is
becoming
increasingly
important
in
industry
and
is
often
mentioned
as
a
crucial
skill
for
future
employment
in
maker
culture
the
ability
to
program
along
with
other
technical
skills
often
exceeds
this
limitation
and
also
includes
fun
activities
through
personally
fabricated
projects
in
this
paper
we
examine
computational
design
projects
that
are
intended
to
be
3d
printed
and
could
potentially
introduce
coding
learning
actions
to
find
computationally
rich
designs
that
are
appealing
to
learners
we
conducted
data
analysis
on
an
online
makerspace
which
exploits
computational
design
tools
for
personal
fabrication
we
found
the
most
liked
designs
of
the
online
makerspace
and
examined
which
of
them
included
programming
features
iterations
conditional
statements
and
functionsmodules
and
could
foster
computational
thinking
elements
such
as
abstract
and
algorithmic_thinking
pattern
recognition
and
decomposition
the
most
liked
category
of
designs
was
figures
of
animals
and
popular
animation
characters
among
other
things
which
surprisingly
often
also
included
programming
features
we
discuss
the
implications
of
our
research
for
technologists
academics
and

who
wish
to
include
3d

fundamental
to

beyond
however
as
a
cross-domain

design
and

remain
equivocal
indeed
the

of
the

have
a
predominant

and
neglecting

it
is
necessary
to
integrate
diverse

model
to
measure
ct
we
invited
13
experts
to
participate
in
three
rounds
of
the
delphi
method
and
constructed
a
ct

model
based
on
the
digital

had
good
consistency
and
was
divided
into
four
primary

namely
“analysis”
“design”
“iteration”
and
“generalization”
which
were
weighted
as
026
011
024
and
039
respectively
and
14
secondary
indicators
taken
together
the
study
demonstrated
the
feasibility
to
expand
from
traditional
assessment
methods
to
integrating
digital

in
a
comprehensive
manner
this

investigates
the
practicality
of
incorporating
computational
thinking
ct
education
into
secondary_school
curricula
aiming
to
equip
students
with
essential
21st-century
skills
the
study
assesses
the
readiness
of
educational
institutions
teachers
and
students
to
embrace
ct
as
an
integral
part
of
their
learning
journey
identifying
potential
challenges
and
barriers
to
successful
implementation
to
achieve
these
objectives
the
research
examines
the

and
explores
resource
requirements
and
best
practices
from
around
the
world
as
part
of
this
investigation
an
immersive

approach
will
be
integrated
a
five-day

was
implemented
featuring
a
comprehensive
curriculum
that
covered
key
ct
concepts
problem-solving
techniques

and
problem-based_learning
aligned
with
sustainable

the
program
included
pre-and
post-surveys
to
measure
students’
understanding
of
ct
concepts
and
practical
projects
to
apply
their
learning
results
showed
consistent
improvement
in
students’
self-reported
understanding
of
ct
skills
and
their
ability
to
apply
these
concepts
to
real-world
problems
the
study
reveals
that
integrating
ct
into
secondary_education
is
not
only
necessary
but
also
highly
beneficial
the
study
emphasizes
that
a
holistic
educational
reform
incorporating

is
essential
for
the

in
conclusion
this
study
provides
valuable
insights
and
recommendations
for
educational
policymakers
administrators
and

interested
in
enhancing
ct
skills
in
secondary

computational

ct
has
been
described
as
a
set
of
valuable
skills
for
tackling
complex
problems
to
foster
ct
among
k-12
students
different
initiatives
have
been
introduced
by
governmental
and
non-governmental
entities
and
numerous
studies
have
been
carried
out
by
researchers
to
define
and
integrate
ct
into
school
curriculum
however
previous
studies
has
shown
little
agreement
among
researchers
governmental
and
non-governmental
sectors
about
a
unified
ct
definition
these
dissensions
have
introduced
challenges
in
formulating
a
definition
for
ct
at
the
k-12
level
the
absence
of
a
unified
definition
may
increase
the
challenges
for
teachers
to
teach
and
integrate
ct
into
school
curriculum
to
foster
ct
among
k-12
students
we
introduce
a
definition
and
framework
for
ct
we
evaluated
39
articles
and
extracted
the
most
common
elements
used
in
the
literature
to
frame
ct
definition
and
describe
its
elements
several
studies
have
discussed
as
well
as
investigated
the
significance
of
conceptualizing
and
comprehending
the
interaction
and
dependency
relationships
among
computational
objects
however
our
literature
review
discovered
that
little
attention
has
been
dedicated
to
the
concept
of
dependency
in
the
ct
body
of
knowledge
based
on
the
literature
review
we
define
ct
as
the
thought
process
used
for
solving
problems
and
it
encompasses
the
elements
of
problem
decomposition
abstraction
and
algorithmic_thinking
we
conjecture
the
ct
definition
is
missing
the
element
of
dependency
in
the
context
of
ct
we
define
dependency
as
the
knowledge
of
comprehending
the
interrelationships
between
different
sections
of
a
decomposed
problem
we
present
our
approach
and
experiences
in
teaching
computational
thinking
problem_solving
team-work
and
project
management
skills
to
several
elementary
level
children
using
lego
mindstorms
ev3
robotics
education
kit
we
taught
students
how
to
design
construct
and
program
robots
using
components
such
as
motors
sensors
wheels
axles
beams
connectors
and
gears
students
also
gained
knowledge
on
basic
programming
constructs
such
as
control
flow
loops
branches
and
conditions
using
a
visual
programming
environment
we
carefully
observed
how
students
performed
various
tasks
and
solved
problems
we
present
experimental
results
which
demonstrates
that
our
teaching
methodology
consisting
of
both
the
course
content
and
pedagogy
was
useful
in
imparting
the
desired
skills
and
knowledge
to
elementary
level
children
the
computational
thinking
view
recognizes
that
underlying
computing
concepts
are
integral
to
our
everyday
lives
and
pervasive
in
many
disciplines
of
study
computer
science
information
systems
computer
engineering
informatics
software
engineering-these
are
among
the
smorgasbord
of
choices
available
to
college
students
interested
in
a
computing
career
the
choices
for
noncomputing-oriented
students
who
want
to
learn
about
the
field
are
even
more
confounding
indeed
the
established
term
computing
in
schools
has
gained
momentum
in
the
last
two
years
resulting
in
gcses
in
computing
and
teachers
looking
to
up
skill
from
digital
literacy
ict
for
many
students
the
subject
of
computer
science
concerns
software
code
but
writing
code
can
be
challenging
due
to
specific
requirements
on
syntax
and
spelling
with
new
ways
of
thinking
required
not
only
do
many
undergraduate
students
lack
these
ways
of
thinking
but
there
is
a
general
misrepresentation
of
computing
in
education
were
computing
taught
as
a
more
serious
subject
like
science
and
mathematics
public
understanding
of
the
complexities
of
computer
systems
would
increase
enabling
those
not
directly
involved
with
it
make
better
informed
decisions
and
avoid
incidents
such
as
over
budget
and
underperforming
systems
we
present
our
exploration
into
teaching
a
variety
of
computing
skills
most
significantly
in
this
pilot
study
we
created
and
evaluated
a
new
version
of
the
techcheck
computational
thinking
ct
assessment
designed
specifically
for
kindergarten
students
the
original
version
of
techcheck
was
validated
in
first
and
second
graders
and
consists
of
15
multiple
choice
unplugged
challenges
drawn
from
six
ct
domains
the
kindergarten
version
called
techcheck-k
consists
of
similar
unplugged
challenges
but
reduces
the
number
of
response
choices
from
four
to
three
and
uses
exclusively
non-verbal
material
in
the
responses
to
accommodate
younger
pre-literate
children
we
administered
techcheck-k
to
n
89
kindergarten
students
from
four
schools
including
45
boys
and
44
girls
with
no
coding
experience
participants
completed
the
assessment
in
an
average
of
2343
minutes
techcheck-k
scores
were
normally
distributed
m

mean
scores
were
numerically
higher
in

m
871
sd
269
than

m
805
sd
207
the
difference
between
genders
was
not
significant
the
pattern
of
correct
responses
to
the
15
techcheck-k
items
correlated
r
76
with
the
pattern
observed
in
first
and
second
graders
on
the
original
techcheck
providing
evidence
that
comparable
ct
constructs
are
measured
by
the
two
versions
of
the
instrument
results
of
this
pilot
study
indicate
that
techcheck-k
has
acceptable
characteristics
for
assessment
of
ct
in
kindergarten
children
computational-thinking
skills
are
an
essential
intellectual
amplifier
for
all
scientific
and
professional
disciplines
embedding
these
skills
in
the
k-12
and
university
curricula
is
necessary
for
training
the
next
generation
of
thinkers
a
widely
adopted
approach
to
doing
so
is
through
simple
and
visual
programming
languages
like
scratch
and
engaging
assignments
like
video-game
construction
in
this
work
we
report
on
an
empirical
study
we
conducted
with
senior
undergraduate
education
students
aiming
to
understand
how
prior
experience
enables
students
to
better
develop
their
computation-thinking
skills
through
a
scratch-based
video-game
assignment
currently
the
education
sector
has
been
transformed
because
of
the
incorporation
of
information
and
communication
technologies
as
a
valuable
support
for
the
formation
of
digital
skills
and
significant
learning
in
this
article
we
present
how
educational
robotics
can
be
integrated
into
a
school
environment
allowing
the
achievement
of
curricular
objectives
and
the
development
of
programming
skills
and
computational
thinking
the
study
was
oriented
towards
a
population
of
131

belonging
to
a
concerted
educational

of
the

describes
the

shows
what
was
the
acceptance
expressed
by
teachers
and
students
about
the
incorporation
of
educational
robotics
in
the
classroom
for
a
number
of
years
various
games
have
been
used
as
an
educational
tool
at
different
academic
levels
especially
in
primary_education
however
only
recently
games
that
teach
coding
and
algorithmic_thinking
or
even
broader
computational
thinking
emerged
initiatives
like
hour
of
code
and
similar
online
activities
or
block-based
programming
games
popularized
the
field
while
at
the
same
time
projects
like
csunplugged
showed
that
the
“idea
of
programming”
can
be
learned
even
without
using
the
computer
in
this
paper
we
present
our
experience
so
far
in
creating
and
implementing
different
unplugged_activities
that
teach
students
of
different
age
levels
from
early
primary_school

indicated
that

we
also
received
a
number
of
useful
feedback

as
to
expand

the
discipline
of

is
rapidly
changing
most
contemporary
records

created
stored
maintained
used

preserved
in
digital

most
graduate

and
continuing
education
programs
in
archival
studies
address
this
challenge
by
introducing
students
to
information
technology
as
it
relates
to
digital
records
we
propose
an
approach
to
addressing
this
challenge
based
on
introducing
computational
thinking
into
the
graduate
archival
studies
curriculum
this
paper
is
about
various
aspects
of
the
computational
thinking
and
problem_solving
course
offered
to
entry-level
undergraduate
engineering
students
across
7
engineering
disciplines
at

india
the
various
aspects
include
the
motivations
for
offering
the
course
aims
and
objectives
of
the
course
course
design
as
well
as
the
delivery
and
assessment
of
the
course
the
paper
also
shares
the
experience
of
conducting
the
course
to
a
very
large
number
of
students
and
the
lessons
learnt
during
the
process
computational
thinking
ct
does
not
require
profound
knowledge
of
computer
science
cs
vice
versa
it
helps
students
organize
and
build
up
new
knowledge
around
the
core
cs
concepts
they
encounter
on
the
daily
basis
furthermore
ct
provides
a
set
of
problem-solving
skills
and
enhances
analytical
abilities
that
are
crucial
for
the
young
generation
to
succeed
in
modern
world
pervaded
with
technology
teaching
the
principles
of
computing
to
students
with
non-computing
tracks
of
study
provides
them
with
a
competitive
advantage
and
breaks
down
stereotypes
around
cs
our
approach
is
to
introduce
a
topic
related
to
world
issues
and
students
interests
while
concealing
its
relation
to
cs
until
students
interest
and
attention
are
captured
the
approach
takes
advantage
of
pattern-matching
abilities
that
are
naturally
wired
in
our
brain
to
improve
understanding
and
make
the
obtained
knowledge
persist
in
memory
the
paper
discusses
some
of
the
modules
developed
as
part
of
the
inspire-ct
project
that
can
be
delivered
in

aims
to
cultivate
the
scientific
computational

mode
and
the
ability
of
solving

for
students
who
are
not
the
computer
majors
in
this
study
a
new
pedagogical
method
named
pbl-vp
combining
the
problem-based_learning
pbl
and
the
visual
programming
blockly
was
applied
to
computer

this
paper
described
a
classical
example
about
problem_solving
to
explain
the
teaching
process
of
the
pbl-vp
in
detail
the
process
of
problem_solving
was
divided
into
several
operable
steps
to
gradually
guide
students
to
analyze
problems
provide
solutions
and
establish
scientific
logic
thinking
blockly
was
introduced
to
obscure
the
grammar
of
programming
language
and
implement
the
algorithm
visually
finally
we
evaluated
the
effectiveness
of
the
pbl-vp
teaching
method
on
student
learning
by
a
contrast
test
the
empirical
results
proved
that
students
in
the
class
with
pbl-vp
earned
higher
final
grades
and
the
teaching
method
we
proposed
played
a
positive
role
in
computer
general
education
while
computational
thinking
ct
has
been
identified
as
one
of
the
fundamental
21st
century
skills
that
can
be
applied
to
different
domains
school
students
usually
show
negative
attitude
toward
learning
ct
educational
games
have
been
applied
by
several
researchers
to
address
related
issues
faced
for
promoting
ct
even
though
such
games
have
shown
some
success
in
promoting
ct
they
fall
short
when
it
comes
to
acquisition
of
ct
skills
they
rather
promote
abstract
and
conceptual
knowledge
and
offering
adaptivity
to
each
player
to
address
these
issues
and
improve
the
existing
games
we
developed
an
adaptive
game
called
autothinking
for
teaching
both
ct
concepts
and
skills
engaging
students
with
individually
tailored
gameplay
and
learning
we
conducted
a
qualitative
study
aimed
at
understanding
the
cognitive
and
affective
experiences
of
estonian
primary_school
children
the
findings
showed
that
autothinking
is
making
children
feel
challenged
happy
and
confident
while
activating
their
thinking
process
during
the
gameplay
all
children
perceived
the
game
positively
and
found
it
to
be
a
good
tool
for
learning
computational
thinking
ct
can
amplify
learners
skill
sets
so
that
they
become
excellent

way
the
framework
stands
out
by
including
collaborative_learning
features
defined
in
the
main
literature
also
the
strategy
was
developed
specifically
to
fit
the
games
dynamics
the
approach
was
evaluated
via
metacognitive
and
transactive
analysis
and
by
a
survey
the
results
showed
evidence
that
the
method
is
able
to
stimulate
interaction
among

to
apply
problem-solving
strategies
in
todays

one
of
the

the
premise
of
integrating
ct
with
other
subjects
is
to
promote
school
teachers
with
high
self-efficacy
in
ct
towards
this
we
developed
a
three-week

course
based
on
mit
ct
framework
then
implemented
an
online
training
among
84
primary

teachers
from
different
subjects
including
chinese

revealed
that
the
online

this
paper
aims
to
study
the
potential
of
th
computational

ct
has
been
described
as
the
use
of

skills
for

thus
becoming
a
set
of
fundamental

for
the
21st

many
initiatives
have
emerged
to
promote
early
development
of

however
to
date
there
are
no
studies
in
which
ct
is
developed
in
minority
groups
such
as
individuals
with

in
this

we
present
the
design
and
evaluation
of
a

aimed
at
teenagers
with

disorders
an
analysis
of
the
artifacts
produced
by
the
participants
of
a
pilot
offering
of
the

was
performed
using
a

the
results
showed
that
the
participants
all
of
them
with
high-functioning
autism
and
no
previous
experience
with

acquired
intermediate

skills
related
to
ct
while
there
has
been
a
rising
interest
in
computational

ct
and
a
push
to
include
it
into
the
k-12
curriculum
there
is
little
empirical
evidence
that
a
class
that
teaches
ct
will
have
any
measurable
long-term
effects
on
student
performance
using
robotics
as
an
example
of

i
propose
to
examine
a

face
challenges
in

we
infused

we
integrated
ct
with

teaching
general
problem-solving
techniques
with
a
flowchart-based
programming
environment
and
without
using

our
aim
here
is
not

also
to

the
different

identify
appropriate
factors
which
relate
to
the
learners
motivation
for
supporting
the
computational

this
is
importance
because

and
to
make

ct
is
the
new
way
of
learning
experience
in
this
21st
century
learning
it
has
been
integrated
through

in
other
developing
countries
like
australia

and
uk
in
order
for
students
and
teachers
in

to
be
equipped
with
this
new
skill
this
research
study
has
employed
action
research
and
qualitative
research
methodologies
a
new
framework
known
as
cicp
has
been
constructed
to
integrate
ct
in
higher
educational
curriculum
this
research
study
has
also
shown
two
different
components
of
students
learning
experience
computational
thinking
ct
concept
is
a
problem-solving
approach
that
includes
logical
ordering
analyzing
data
and
preparing
solutions
with
the
help
of
different
visualization
tools
like
flowcharts
graphs
pie

etc
ct
is
not
just
used
by
computer
programmer
but
it
can
also
be
used
by
students
and
teachers
in
any
classroom
so
that
teaching
learning
process
becomes
successful
ct
is
an
important
element
for
the
expansion
of
computer
software
along
with
providing
the
huge
support
to
problem_solving
skills
across
all
disciplines
of
education
like
engineering

and
k12
education
it
gives
a
logical
idea
to
the
students
to
solve
a

systematically
using
algorithm
development
flowchart
design
and
programming
and
problem-solving
skills
ct
increases
the
confidence
among

in
dealing
with
complexity
of
difficult

the
capacity
to
handle
complex

and
collaborate
with

in
this
research
paper
authors
discuss
the
impact
of
ct
among
the
students
of
different
specialization
of
engineering
and
k12
by
using
different
problem-solving
techniques
and
strategies
such
as
modeling
making
sub
goals
pruning
and
searching
so
that
students
will
be
able
to
think
differently
towards
new
problems
block-oriented
programming
environments
such
as
scratch
and
appinventor
have
become
mainstream
and
have
helped
introduce
non-programmers
to
algorithmic_thinking
that
is
to
computational

ct
skills
in
various
experiments
referenced
in
this

we
observed
how

tui
objects
-
can
help
develop
ct
skills
we
investigate
which
paradigm
can
be
used
to
introduce
ct
skills
with
tuis
by
drawing
on
past
experience
we
conclude
that
block-oriented
programming
provides
a
suitable
answer
to
our
research
questions
furthermore
we
introduce
a
framework
for
implementing
block-oriented
programmable
objects
that
we
believe
can
help
end-users
learn
ct
skills
the
essence
of

and
adopting
the

have
been
improved
which
provides
a

for
the

education
in

computational

ct
is
a
set
of
abilities
which
has
lately
acquired
great
relevance
because
it
brings
to
students
the
components
to
handle

and
develop
analytical

which
allows
them
to
perform
ac-cording
to
todays
society
in
this

the
authors
describe
the
development
of

presents
a
method
of

an

rubric
is
proposed
to
identify
the
level
of

the
rubric
was
applied
by
computer

teachers
in
the
evaluation
of

of
the
cs
unplugged
project
it
was
possible
to
observe
that
all
concepts
of
the
ct
were
present
in
the
unplugged_activities
but
without
reaching
the
maximum
score
of
the
rubric
various
didactic
strategies
to
develop
computational

ct
skills
have
been
successful
in
terms
of
student
engagement
and
educational
outcomes
however
monitoring
the
learning
progress
of
students
is
still
a
hurdle
to
teachers
and
researchers
in
this
context
we
explore
the
use
of
self-organizing
maps
for
analyzing
games
produced
in
a
game
building
workshop
offered
simultaneously
to
technical
education
students
in
brazil
and
to
undergraduate
students
in
computer
engineering
in
chile
metrics
from
seven
ct
features
present
in
the
games
were
extracted
with
the
dr
scratch
tool
and
used
as
an
input
in
the
training
process
the
results
allowed
a
clustering
analysis
considering
the
identified
features
and
the
correlation
between
learning
behaviors
the
organization
of
the
map
reflected
a
progressive
skill
acquisition
identified
by
features
present
in
the
developed
games
also
it
could
be
identified
that
students
of
both
educational
levels
reached
similar
levels
of
ct
skill
development
computational
thinking
ct
is
considered
a
necessary
21st-century
competence
that
should
be
introduced
to
school
education
as
a
vital
ingredient
however
the
lack
of
a
consensual
definition
of
ct
and
the
confusion
with
other
similar
terms
made
it
a
big
challenge
for
researchers
and
practitioners
to
understand
this
concept
the
purpose
of
this
work-in-progress
wip
is
to
identify
and
compare
the
existing
definitions
of
ct
proposed
by
various
members
of
the
education
or
research
community
and
ultimately
to
give
educators
and
researchers
suggestions
on
understanding
this
concept
for
particular
purposes
or
situations
we
conducted
a
systematic
review
of
the
definitions
of
ct
from
the
source
of
academic
articles
and
categorized
the
definitions
based
on
their
approaches
dimensions
and
contexts
forty-one
unique
and
original
concepts
were
extracted
from
the
search
results
indicate
that
the
existing
definitions
of
ct
were
mostly
formulated

with
a
prototype
approach
2
for
the
generic
purpose
of
use
3
in
the
context
of
k-12
education
4
based
on
the
subject
of
computer
science
these
results
provide
sufficient
granularity
to
allow
us
to
come
up
with
suggestions
on
how
to
choose
appropriate
and
pragmatic
ct
definitions
broadening
participation
and
increasing
equity
in
computer

cs
have
been
goals
of
the
computing
field
for
decades
initiatives
seeking
to
increase
access
to
cs
have
led
to
an
increase
in
elementary

teaching
computational
thinking
ct
but
students
are
often
instructed
by
classroom
teachers
who
have
no
formal
training
in
ct
or
cs
our
project
prepares
in-service
and
pre-service
elementary
teachers
to
integrate
ct
into
their
science
lessons
while
our
overall
goal
was
to
increase
ct
access
for
all
students
we
found
some
teachers
enacted
ct
in
ways
that
did
not
always
provide
equal
access
to
all
students
although
our
professional
development
adopted
a
cs
for
all
approach
without
explicit
supports
a
group
of
teachers
implemented
ct
in
ways
often
upholding
the
current
trends
of
inequity
and
power
structures
within
cs
our
findings
suggest
teachers
would
benefit
from
explicit
support
to
provide
opportunities
for
students
currently
underrepresented
in
cs
and
to
offer
more
equitable
opportunities
to
students
regardless

ct
has
been
stated
as
a
fundamental
skill
for

not
just
for

the
concept
of

is
very
important
to
be
taught
to

so
that
it
can
be
applied
as
early
as
possible
in

now
the
suitable
ct

we
encountered
several
challenges
recruiting
and
retaining

and
found
that
computer

do
not
fall
into
the
stereotype
of
most
computer

participation
of

was
higher
than

a
disconnect
appeared
between
the
pedagogical

high_school
level
and
those
being
practiced
at

in
the
potential
of
using
more
student-centered
instruction
not
only
for
high_school
instruction
but
also
for
their

an
area
of
disconnect
also
emerged
in
the
programming

as
all
the

were
comfortable
with

all
were
unfamiliar

ct
in

has
increased
over

years
games
are
recognized
as
a
good
strategy
for
presenting
ct
and
for
engaging

to
the
learning
of
its
concepts
hand

are
a
form
of

widely
used
in
video-games
however
few
studies
have
been
conducted
to
investigate
how
children
feel
and
interact
when
using
hand
gestures
in
the
context
of

tools
and
this
number
decrease
in
studies
about
ct
learning
in
this
paper
we
explore
the
feedback
of
29
children
about
their
interaction
by
using
hand
gestures
in
a
game
to
stimulate
the
ct
which
we
called
ct
game
we
also
compare
this
type
of
interaction
to
touch
additionally
we
examine
how
both
hand
gestures
and
touch
can
impact
on
accomplishing
of
the
goals
of
the
game
phases
our
findings
revealed
the
children
kept
more
engaged
when
using
hand
gestures
and
consequently
this
affected
their
concentration
on
the
game
purpose
current
information
technology
courses
have
problems
such
as
insufficient
attention
from
students
unclear
training
goals
and
single

methods
traditional
teaching
can
no
longer
meet
the
needs
of
modern
education
and
the
teaching
reform
of
information

courses
is
imperative
therefore
this
article
proposes
to
apply
gamification
teaching
to
information
technology
courses
to
increase
students’
interest
in

and
cultivate
students’
computational
thinking
that
is
the
ability
to
use
the
basic
concepts
of
computer

to
solve
complex

this
article
takes
the
secondary
vocational
information
technology
course
as
an
example
to
study
the
specific
application
of
gamification
teaching
and
proposes
a
case
of
“gobang

to
provide
a

the
framework
is
expected
to
aid

this
is
particularly
important
in

disciplines
where
logical
reasoning
is
essential
for
addressing
complex
real-world

past
two
years
at
our
institute
to
teach
ct
in
a
gateway
course
to
students
with
different

the
approach
involved
designing
specific
learning
modules
on
abstraction
decomposition
pattern
recognition
and
algorithmic_thinking
and
integrating
them
into
the
lms
after
studying
these
learning
modules
the
students
were
exposed
to
specific
assignments
that
required
the
application
of
related
ct
skills
pre

post
surveys
were
employed
by
using
standard
ct
tests
to
measure
the
impact
of

ct
levels
the
results
indicated
an
improvement
in

post-intervention
this
two-year
study
on
improving
ct
skills
has
yielded
promising
results
moving

the
research
aims
to
enhance
the
existing
modules
further
and
distribute
them
to
a
broader
range
of
introductory-level
stem
courses
in
other
universities
this
future
direction
aligns
with
the
goal
of
expanding
the
impact
of
ct
education
and
integrating
it
more
widely
into
stem
curricula
this
document
describes
the
development
of
a
stem
course
intended
to
improve
the
computational
thinking
of
university
students
ct
the
main
instructional
tool
for
this
course
is
the
beam
robot
a
robotics
paradigm
that
proposes
simple
robots
whose
behavior
can
be
controlled
without
software
programming
the
programming
of
this
robot
is
implicit
in
its
morphology
so
its
actions
and
goals
are
codified
from
its
construction
a
three-phase
curriculum
is
designed
to
achieve
the
objective
propaedeutic
robot
assembly
and
ct
on
the
basis
of
these
phases
the
course
is
constructed
modularly
and
implemented
virtually
while
students
receive
construction
kits
each
phase
aims
to
foster
the
many
facets
of
ct
such
as
decomposition
abstraction
algorithm
debugging
iteration
and
generalization
students’
responses
to
pre-and
post-course
surveys
as
well
as
evaluation
activities
and
logs
are
analyzed
to
determine
the
course’s
impact
on
them
in
addition
to
other
stem
disciplines
electrical
electronic
mechanical
and
weee
the
course
substantially
improves
the
ct
the
development
of
computer
science
has
led
to
an
increase
in
programming
education
for
younger
people
many
countries
have
begun
programming
education
in
elementary
schools
as
is
a
relatively
new
subject
in
elementary
education
the
course
design
and
textbooks
for
programming
education
remain
under
development
the
growth
trend
in
computational
thinking
ct
is
helpful
for
educators
to
teach
suitable
programming
concepts
to
students
scratch
which
is
mostly
used
as
an
introductory
programming
language
for
elementary_school
students
can
be
evaluated
to
reflect
students’
ct
in
this
work-in-progress
research
we
conducted
a
data-driven
analysis
on
fourth-grade
students’
ct
growth
in
their
first
3
years
of
programming
learning
by
evaluating
their
scratch
projects
a
preliminary
result
shows
that
ct
grows
rapidly
in
the
first
2
years
and
tends
to
be
stable
in
the
third
year
the
reasons
for
the
difference
in
growth
of
specific
ct
concepts
are
discussed
developing

are
interactive
engaging
and
help
learners
build
problem-solving
and
logical

this
is
however
one
part
of
the
equation
for

the
other
part
of

addresses
this
perspective
to
aid
in
the
understanding

the
study
aims
to
examine
the
effectiveness
of
flipped-classroom
instruction
on
college
students’
computational

skills
cts
participants
were
enrolled
in
the
basic
computer
course
from
two
classes
at
a
university
in
central
china
one
class
as
an
experimental
group
was
chosen
for
the
flipped-classroom
instruction
method
n55
the
other
as
a
control
group
used
the
traditional
lecture-based
instruction
method
n54
the
results
show
that
learning
through
the
flipped-classroom
approach
can
significantly
promote
students’
levels
of
creativity
algorithmic_thinking
cooperativity
and
critical_thinking
compared
with
the
traditional
lecture-based

approach
the
findings
of
this
research
suggest
that
instructors
should
be
encouraged
to
take
the
flipped-classroom

method
to
teach
cs
for

is
a
new
education
initiative
launched
in
2016
to
empower
a
generation
of
american
students
with
the
computer
science
skills
they
need
to
thrive
in
a
digital
economy
in
order
to
keep
up
with
trends
in
the
growing
technology-driven
world
students
should
have
the
ability
to
analyze
and
consider
the
consequences
of
computing
problems
critically
however
introducing
cs
and
computational
thinking
skills
to
the
first
year
students
in
college
is
a
difficult
task
because
the
nature
of
the
subject
tends
to
be
dry
and
conceptual
thus
we
introduce
a
computer
science
course
that
helps
all
undergraduate
students
to
prepare
for
digital
life
as
well
as
enhance
their
critical_thinking
skills
through
hands-on
learning
experiences
the
course
contents
introduce
the
general
concept
of
computer
science
such
as
computing
system
basic
networking
algorithms
and
programming
with
scratch
and
mbot
robot
exercises
our
student
feedback
shows
a
high
level
of
enthusiasm
and
engagement
among
the
students
the
strong
hands-on
learning
nature
of
the
course
helped
our
students
to
have
more
engaging
and
interactive
classroom
experiences
game-based_learning
gbl
can
motivate

and
enable
them
to
engage
in
their

additionally
the
popularity
of
gbl
has
grown
in
computer

and
programming
courses
where
it
can
be
used
to
develop

ct
is
critical_thinking
used
to
apply
fundamental
concepts
and
reasoning
derived
from

research
has
shown
that
digital
gbl
can
improve
critical_thinking
skills
and
help
learners
understand
programming
concepts
structures
and
problem-solving
strategies
despite
the
popularity
of
digital
gbl
analog
card
games
and
bingo
games
are
still
valuable
and
effective
tools
for
learning
however
most
studies
on
gbl
that
aim
to
train
critical_thinking
skills
have
focused
on
digital
approaches
this
indicates
a
gap
in
the
body
of
knowledge
because
few
studies
have
explored
the
effectiveness
of
analog
games
for
developing
ct
skills
through
gbl
the
theoretical
framework
of
this
study
is
grounded
in
two
learning
theories
constructivist
theory
frames
learning
as
the
construction
of
knowledge
through
a
process
of
action
reflection
and
construction
constructionist
learning
theory
calls
for

during
the
process
to
investigate
the
design
of
gbl
for
developing

and
to
generate
discourse
for
its
widespread
adoption
the
current

majors
by
addressing
the

the
research
question
posed
is
how
can
we
optimize
ct
learning
through
gbl
based
on
learner
experiences
and
learning
theories
prior
to
this
study
the
instructor
used
gbl
in
which
learners
played
an
analog
three-dimensional
tic-tac-toe
game
with
ping
pong
balls
and
then
wrote
a
computer
program
that
simulated
that
game
we
chose
to
conduct
dbr
to
strengthen
the

associated
with
this
activity
dbr
uses
iterative
designs
to
develop
knowledge
that
improves
educational
practices
in
the
spring
of
2023
we
assessed
the
extent
to
which
the
non-digital
game
and
programming
the
simulated
game
enhanced
learners
ct
skills
by
analyzing
their
experiences
with

this
involved
collecting
and
analyzing
learner
surveys
to
gain

years
old
for
this
purpose
a
quasi-experiment
with
52
children

was
performed
the
obtained

this
highlights
the
fact
that

serve
as
an
instrument
to

the
disappointing
results
that

been
showing
in
external

cause
us
concern
technologies

it
is
therefore
necessary
in
some
way
to
change
this
paradigm
with
regard
to
the
role
that
the

plays
from
consumer

this
extremely
complex
scenery
this

intends
to
show
how
a
proposal
launched
in

combined
aspects
of
gamification
and
computational

aiming
to
bring
another
look
at

of
gamified
activity
in
the
style
of
a
game
known
as
“escape

was
presented
using
the

we
note
that
insecurity
with
technological
tools
or
lack
of
knowledge
about
some
features
of
these
same
tools
is
still
a
factor
that
causes
many
concerns
among
teachers
we
concluded
that
reflection
on
ourpractice
is
fundamental
and
in
a
way
we
realize
that
we
have
managed
to
broaden
our
horizons
about
the
use
of
certain
technological
tools
in
this

we
summarize
results
of
our

came
across
with

the
linkage
and
necessity
of

and
relevance
with

is
obvious
but
out
of
scope
of
this

this
systematic
review
aims
to
explore
how

we
developed
30

work-in-progress
paper
discusses
a
next-generation
learning
system
for
k-12
students
to
educate
them
on
scientific
concepts
surrounding
the
human
body
specifically
our
gamified
learning
system
is
designed
to
make
learning
more
fun
engaging
and
effective
through
game
and
experiment
elements
that
align
with
science
and
math
learning
standards
it
will
also
increase
systematic
problem-solving
and
algorithmic
reasoning
for
k-12
students
since
the
human
body
can
be
thought
of
as
a
combination
of
interacting
systems
the
game
also
introduces
students
to
computational
thinking
by
introducing
internal
body
functions
to
achieve
these
goals
this
project
has
two
components
first
an
educational
virtual
reality
game
will
be
built
according
to
the
natural
human
body
structure
during
the
game
process
students
will
experience
the
same
as
the
human
body
functions
travel
along
the
blood
circulation
help
with
the
heartbeat
and
participate
in
oxygen
exchange
while
students
are
playing
the
game
our
gamified
adaptive
learning
system
tracks
and
controls
the
students
learning
progress
as
the
ai
component
collects
student
data
and
uses
this
information
our
system
adjusts
game
content
and
addresses
possible
learner
issues
to
refine
the
learning
curriculum
for
a
faster
and
more
effective
learning
experience
second
a
series
of
hands-on
activities
will
be
conducted
based
on
the
functions
of
the
human
body
eg
developing
an
artificial
heart
and
experiencing
how
the
heart
works
through
this
project
an
attractive
and
efficient
next-generation
learning
system
will
be
developed
and
used
to
expose
k-12
students
to
this
learning
system
the
education
of
students
will
be
accomplished
in
different
dimensions
through
games
and
hands-on
practice
respectively
additionally
compared
to
traditional
learning
methods
our
learning
system
not
only
increases
students
interest
in
learning
but
also
makes
it
more
personalized
compared
to
the
conventional
learning
process
likewise
we
will
refer
to
the
results
of
self-efficacy
surveys
administered
to
students
and
teachers
separately
to
test
their
perceptions
of
their
abilities
and
the
new
system
blockpy
is
a
block-based
program
language
which
has
both
block-based
interface
and
traditional
text-based
interface
it
fills
the
gap
between
block-based
programming
and
language
coding
but
there
is
little
work
that
focuses
on
the
computational
thinkingct
evaluation
of
blockpy
programs
in
this
paper
we
design
and
implement
a
blockpy
analysis
tool
to
assess
the
ct
skills
of
blockpy
programs
automatically
we
use
pythons
built-in
ast
module
to
analyse
each
node
in
the
abstract
syntax
treeast
of
each
blockpy
program
then
considering
the
characteristics
of
python
language
we
propose
a
new
ct
evaluation
criteria
based
on
scratch
analysis
toolsat
under
the
guidance
of
the
ct
evaluation
criteria
we
propose
a
detailed
scoring
program
to
analyze
each

of
the

and
get

therefore
the

is
a

that
at
first
sight
has
not
much
to
do
with
language
learning
however
as
demanded
by
jeannette

in
2006
it
should
be
taught
to
everyone
like
reading

by
introducing

computational
thinking
has
recently
been
widely
recognized
as
a
fundamental
skill
that
should
be
cultivated
for
everyone
and
in
every
field
although
there
is
an
increasing
interest
in

in
recent

an
engaging

is
yet
to
be
built
for
teaching

and
applying
computational

online
to
this
end
we
have
developed

the
main
contributions
of
this

we
developed
a
new
effective
online
learning
model
for
computational
thinking
based
on
our
previous
widely-applied
r2d2
model
a
signature
characteristic
of
this
new
model
is
being
interactive
and
learner-centered
thus
the
call
for
innovative
talents
in
the
information
age
is
imminent
with
the
promulgation
of
the
domestic
high_school
information
technology
curriculum
standards
in
2017
the
formulation
and
positioning
requirements
of
the
core

computational

as
one
of
the
four
core

is
the
thinking
ability
that
everyone
should
have
many
foreign
educational

studies
have
shown
that
mind

can
effectively
promote
students
cognitive
development
and
knowledge
construction
however
the
domestic
educational
application
research
is
relatively
lacking
in
this
aspect
and
there
is
little
research
on
the
comprehensive
and
in-depth
combination
of
it
and
the
core
literacy
“computational
thinking”
of
the
specific
information

discipline
to
this
end
based
on
the
research
status
at
home
and
abroad
this
paper
attempts
to
use
the
concept
map
tool
to
represent
several
important
functions
of
computational
thinking
for
the
last
two
decades
the
world
of
pre-academic
and
academic
education
has
been
occupied
with
ways
of
developing
computational
thinking
responding
to
the
common
perception
to
develop
those
thinking
skills
in
all
learners
and
indeed
in
the
entire
population
we
developed
a
mooc
on
computational
thinking
the
course
advocates
the
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
in
every
human
being
at
any
age
and
in
any
subject
matter
emphasizing
the
common
essential
computational

skills
problem
decomposition
abstraction
and
generalization
based
on
our
belief
in
the
importance
of
the
application
of
computational
thinking
skills
when
using
computerized
environments
and
the
importance
of
its
significant
application
in
developing
an
understanding
of
any
discipline
the
course
is
based
on
the
development
of
simulations
of
computational
processes
in
any
area
of
knowledge
we
widely
discuss
the
pedagogical
challenges
of
developing
a
mooc
on
thinking
skills
without
teacher-learner
interaction
and
share
how
we
overcame
these
challenges
by
implementing
the
four
pedagogies
for
developing
computational
thinking
4p4ct
framework
which
integrates
the
pedagogies
of
active

project-based_learning
product-based
learning
and
context-based
learning
we
present
preliminary
findings
from
research
we
conducted
during
the
first
two
mooc
cycles
with
about
1600
learners
specifically
quantitative
and
qualitative

of
students
learning
processes
are
discussed
reflecting
the
students
multi-faceted
and
deep
engagement
in
the
mooc
the
era
of
big
data
witnesses
that
‘computing’
has
become
an
indispensable
tool
for
medical
development
in
many
aspects
of
medicine
domain
the
ability
of
computational
thinking
is
of
great
significance
to
medical
students
engaging
in
basic
research
and
clinical
diagnosis
and
treatment
in
the
future
however
medical
students
are
lack
of
this
strategy
in
dealing
with
problems
at
present
meanwhile
there
is
also
a
problem
of
‘insufficient
skills
and
no
training’
in
computer
learning
in
this
article
we
recommend
training
students’
computational
thinking
from
three
aspects
first
students
can
learn
the
basic
concepts
of
computational
thinking
and
different
thinking
modes
of
computer
scientists
through
computer
courses
in
both
theory
and
practice
in
order
to
train
their
computational
thinking
second
in
the
process
of
thinking
students
can
directly
carry
out
divergent
thinking
logical
integration
and
practice
the
thinking
methods
of
scientists
such
as
abstraction
and
simplification
through
the
mind
maps
produced
by
imindmap
software
third
during
the
practice
of
modeling
and
programming
after
using
mind
maps
to
make
the
problem
abstract
and
sort
out
the
content
of
the
creation
to
draw
a
flowchart
students
start
modeling
and
systematic
design
through

software
at
last
under
the
help
of
matlab
some
specific
medical
cases
enable
students
to
apply
computational
thinking
to
practice
comprehensively
our
practice
in

shows
that
these
training
methods
has
positive
influence
in
improving
students
computational
thinking
with
the
concept
of

this

presents
findings
from

at

efforts
to

in

have
revealed
the
need
for
a
deeper
theoretical
and
empirical
understanding
of
how
girls
of

form
computing

in
this
paper
we
use
the
concept
of
identities-in-practice
as
an
analytical
frame
to
examine
how
girls
of

engage
in
computational

practices
our
research
investigates
how
the

can
be
leveraged
as
funds
of

and
asks
the
following
research
question
how
does

impact

of
the

results
from
our
pilot
year
demonstrate
that
integrating
identity
exploration
into
a
computational

results
in
a
mutually
reinforcing
relationship
where
girls
of
color
experience
reflective
identity
development
while
simultaneously
increasing
their
understanding
of

we
present
our
approach
as
a
promising
avenue
for
connecting
computing
knowledge
and
skills
to
girls
identities
and
lived
experiences
by
focusing
on
the
girls
identities
the
program
re-imagines
computational
experiences
by
fostering
interactions
with
computational

from
a
personal
perspective
ultimately
we
argue
that
centering
girls
identities
should
be
viewed
as
an
integral
part
of
the
learning
process
and
not
tangential
the
traditional

there
are

however
the

the
different

a

the

reveal
that

are
the
most

pedagogical
approaches
to
promote

ii
multiple

are
involved
in

are
the
most

this

points
out
to
the
fact
that
there
are
open

for

developing
new

for
promoting

to
acquire
these

being
one
of
the
most
popular
ones
similar
to
professional

learners
also
copy

paste
their

resulting
in

in
this
paper
we
present
the
findings
of
correlating
the
assessment
of
the
ct
skills
of
learners
with
the
presence
of
software
clones
in
over
230000
projects
obtained
from
the
scratch
platform
specifically
we
investigate
i
if
software
cloning
is
an
extended
practice
in
scratch
projects
ii
if
the
presence
of
code
cloning
is
independent
of
the
programming
mastery
of
learners
iii
if
code
cloning
can
be
found
more
frequently
in
scratch
projects
that
require
specific
skills
as
parallelism
or
logical_thinking
and
iv
if
learners
who
have
the
skills
to
avoid
software
cloning
really
do
so
the
results
show
that
i
software
cloning
can
be
commonly
found
in

projects
that
ii
it
becomes
more
frequent
as
learners
work
on
projects
that
require
advanced
skills
that
iii
no
ct
dimension
is
to
be
found
more
related
to
the
absence
of
software
clones
than
others
and
iv
that
learners
-even
if
they
potentially
know
how
to
avoid
cloning-
still
copy
and
paste
frequently
the
insights
from
this
paper
could
be
used
by

to
determine
when
it
is
pedagogically
more
effective
to
address
software
cloning
by
educational
programming
platform
developers
to
adapt
their
systems
and
by
learning
assessment
tools
to
provide
better
evaluations
in
the
last
years
many
didactic
activities
have
been
proposed
to
develop
computational
thinking
ct
skills
in
children
and
adolescents
among
these
activities
the
digital
game
programming
stands
out
as
a
promising
alternative
considering
that
it
is
related
to
a
familiar
and
motivating
context
for
students
these
initiatives
are
not
specifically
aimed
at
individuals
with
special
needs
such
as
the
autism
spectrum
disorder
asd
children
and
adolescents
with
asd
usually
have
some
limitations
related
to
communication
cognitive
flexibility
and
interpersonal
relationships
however
it
seems
natural
that
the
skills
potentially
developed
through
game
programming
activities
are
especially
beneficial
for
the
public
with
asd
in
this
paper
we
describe
the
offering
and
evaluation
of
a

adapted
to

with
this
condition
the
guidelines
used
to
define
the
workshop
activities
are
described
an
assessment
based
on
the
classroom
observation
and
analysis
of
produced
artifacts
indicate
that
the
participants
acquired
ct
skills
related
to
programming
at
a
high
level
in
addition
the
collaborative
nature
of
the
activities
offered
a
stimulating
and
welcoming

we
planned

carried
out
systematic
mapping
of
the
literature
the
results
show
that
through
er
ct
is
approached
through
the
teaching
of
programming
languages
in
a
collaborative
way
in
early
childhood
and
high_school
the
most
ct
skills
observed
are
related
to
programming
such
as
sequencing
algorithm
loop
generalization
decomposition
and
debugging
the
main
instruments
for
assessing
students
are
tests
and
the
most
significant
difficulty
is
the
limitation
of
class
hours
finally
lego®
is
the
most
used
technology
in
class
given
the
pervasive
reliance
on
technology
in
modern
society
teaching
computational
thinking
ct
abilities
is
becoming
increasingly
relevant
these
abilities
such
as
modeling
and
coding
have
become
crucial
for
a
larger
audience
of
students
not
only
those
who
wish
to
become
software
engineers
or
computer
scientists
recent
advances
in
large
language
models
llms
such
as
chatgpt
provide
powerful
assistance
to
complete
computational
tasks
by
simplifying
code
generation
and
debugging
and
potentially
enhancing
interactive
learning
however
it
is
not
clear
if
these
advances
make
ct
tasks
more
accessible
and
inclusive
for
all
students
or
if
they
further
contribute
to
a
digital
skills
divide
favoring
the
top
students
to
address
this
gap
we
have
created
and
evaluated
a
novel
learning
scenario
for
transversal
ct
skills
that
leveraged
llms
as
assistants
we
conducted
an
exploratory
field
study
during
the
spring
semester
of
2022
to
assess
the
effectiveness
and
user
experience
of
llm-augmented
learning
our
results
indicate
that
the
usage
of
chatgpt
as
a
learning
assistant
improves
learning
outcomes
furthermore
contrary
to
our
predictions
the
usage
of
chatgpt
by
students
does
not
depend
on
prior
ct
capabilities
and
as
such
does
not
seem
to
exacerbate
prior
inequalities
promoting
computational
thinking
is
one
of
the
top
priorities
in
cs
education
as
well
as
in
other
stem
and
non-stem
disciplines
our
innovative
nsf-funded
ic2think
project
blends
computational
thinking
with
creative
thinking
so
that
students
leverage
their
creative
thinking
skills
to
“unlock”
their
understanding
of
computational
thinking
in
fall
2012
we
deployed
creative
exercises
designed
to
engage
epsteins
creative
competencies
surrounding
capturing

and
broadening
in
introductory

cs
courses
targeting
four
different
groups
cs
engineering
combined

majors
students
combined
hands-on
problem_solving
with
guided
analysis
and
reflection
to
connect
their
creative
activities
to
cs
topics
such
as
conditionals
and
arrays
and
to
real-world
cs
applications
evaluation
results
approximately
150

found
that

these
findings
support
our
belief
that
the
addition
of
creative

exercises
to
csce
courses
improves
the
learning
of
computational
knowledge
and
skills
todays
digital
society
has
turned
the
development
of
students
computational
thinking
capabilities
into
a
critical
factor
for
their
future
success
as
higher_education
institutions
we
need
to
take
responsibility
for
this
development
in
every
degree
course
we
offer
and
provide
students
with
the
kind
of
subjects
and
activities
that
best
contribute
to
this
aim
in
this
paper
we
study
the
impact
of
following
an
introductory
programming
course
on
the
development
of
the
computational
thinking
capabilities
of
university
students
in
order
to
achieve
this
aim
a
concurrent
cohort
observational
study
was
carried
out
in
which
we
measured
both
the
subjective
and
objective
computational
thinking
capabilities
of
104
participants
50
first
year
students
enrolled
on
a
bachelors
degree
course
in
psychology
at
the
catholic
university
of
murcia
ucam
and
54
first
year
students
enrolled
on
a
bachelors
degree
course
in
health
information
systems
at
the
university
of
alicante
ua
the
statistical
procedures
applied
to
test
our
hypotheses
were
a
two-way
mixed
anova
a
paired-sample
t-test
and
an
independent-sample
t-test
the
data
shows
that
the
group
at
ua
had
an
initial
higher
subjective
perception
of
their
computational
capabilities
than
the
group
at
ucam
this
perception
was
supported
by
their
objective
scores
which
were
also
significantly
higher
however
the
subjective
assessment
of
computational
capability
of
the
ua
group
diminished
after
exposure
to
the
programming
course
contrasting
with
the
fact
that
their
objective
computational
capabilities
improved
significantly
in
the
ucam
group
both
subjective
and
objective
capabilities
remained
constant
over
time
based
on
these
results
we
can
conclude
that
computational
thinking
capabilities
are
not
developed
naturally
but
need
to
be
trained
providing
such
training
to
all
our
students
and
not
only
to
those
enrolled
on
undergraduate
degrees
in
engineering
is
of
paramount
importance
to
allow
them
to
face
the
challenges
of
their
future
professions
this
paper
empirically
demonstrates
the
extent
to
which
exposing
subjects
to
a
programming
course
may
contribute
to
this
aim
computational
thinking
is
a
core
capability
for
most
engineers
the
term
summarizes
a
set
of
skills
needed
to
transform
real-life
challenges
into
problems
that
can
be
solved
with
the
help
of
a
computer
and
to
apply
computer-based
solutions
to
questions
at
hand
this
mindset
is
fundamental
to
almost
every
engineering
task
however
teaching
computational
thinking
is
a
great
challenge
for
educators
worldwide
in
designing
and
implementing
university
curricula
one
has
to
take
an
increasing
number
of
arguments
into
consideration
technological
progress
requires
the
design
creation
and
analysis
of
increasingly
large
and
complex
systems
engineering
working
environments
and
tasks
demand
interdisciplinary
teams
and
close
communication
between
involved
groups
in
designing
engineering
curricula
these
factors
need
to
be
considered
and
the
necessary
skills
must
be
implicitly
or
explicitly
developed
this
paper
highlights
three
examples
of
classes
and
projects
aimed
at
enabling
students
to
develop
and
increase
computational
thinking
through
systematic
introduction
of
computational
tools
from
these
successful
case
studies
the
paper
derives
six
best
practices
for
fostering
computational
thinking
in
engineering
education
a
review
of
several
examples
is
given
that
are
used
to
highlight
and
extract
best
practices
this
provides
a
comprehensive
overview
of
the
relationships
and
simplifies
the
application
of
the
aforementioned
principles
to
course
and

the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
look
at
how
a
music
programming
course
affects
the
development
of
computational

procedural
graphical
and
logic
quizzes
while
creativity
is
evaluated
through
a
qualitative
grading
of
the

results
show
a
general
perceived
improvement
of
the
students’
attitudes
toward
the
four
c’s
as
well
as
a
good
ability
to
convert

into
musical
creativity
however
more
effort
is
needed
in
order
to
guarantee
an
overall
improvement
in
the
students’
actual
computational
thinking
abilities
computational
thinking
has
been
widely
regarded
as
an
important
ability
to
adapt
to
the
future
college
students
use
the
knowledge
they
have
learned
to
help
elementary
students
in
the
community
learn
computational
thinking
thereby
enhancing
the
motivation
and
achievement
of

software
tools
to
support
the
learning
of
computational
thinking
in
addition
to
cultivating
students’
basic
knowledge
and
abilities
it
also
assists
the
lack
of
learning
resources
in
community
elementary
schools
through
practical
actions
of
service
learning
so
that
students
can
focus
their
learning
on
task-base
purposes
comprehensive
research
and
analysis
are
conducted
based
on
the
evaluation
of
the

the
results
show
that
it
helps
to
stimulate
students
desire
to
learn
thereby
significantly
improving
academic
performance
and
learning
motivation
at
the
same
time
it
makes
students
have
self-confidence
and
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
makes
learners
aware
of
the
inadequacy
of
self-learning
and
promotes
their
willingness
to
learn
from
passive
to
active
with
the
wide
use
of

and
find
the
appropriate
methods
to
solve

chatgpt
has
received
considerable
attention
in
education
particularly
in
programming
education
because
of
its
capabilities
in
automated
code
generation
and
program
repairing
and
scoring
however
few
empirical
studies
have
investigated
the
use
of
chatgpt
to
customize
a
learning
system
for
scaffolding
students’
computational
thinking
therefore
this
article
proposes
an
intelligent
programming
scaffolding
system
using
chatgpt
following
the
theoretical
framework
of
computational
thinking
and
scaffolding
a
mixed-method
study
was
conducted
to
investigate
the
affordance
of
the
scaffolding
system
using
chatgpt
and
the
findings
show
that
most
students
had
positive
attitudes
about
the
proposed
system
and
it
was
effective
in
improving
their
computational
thinking
generally
but
not
their
problem-solving
skills
therefore
more
scaffolding
strategies
are
discussed
with
the
aim
of
improving
student
computational
thinking
especially
regarding
problem-solving
skills
the
findings
of
this
study
are
expected
to
guide
future
designs
of
generative
artificial
intelligence
tools
embedded
in
intelligent
learning
systems
to
foster
students’
computational

this
work
aims
to
explore
the
application
of
the
physical

as
a
computational

instrument
to
support
learning
and
exercise
proportional
reasoning
at
the

reveal
that
the

is
made
towards
the
end
of

is
formally
introduced
into

the
notion
of

is
very
transversal
and
it
is
one
of
the
fundamental
concepts
of
the
stem

the
consequences
of
an

the
digital
twin
concept
is
becoming
one
of
the
central
instruments
of
digital
transformation
in
this
paper
we
propose
using
computational
thinking
to
help
the
understanding
of
proportional
thinking
using
a
physical
and
digital
twin
pair
in
2022
computational
thinking
was
introduced
into
the
spanish
and
catalan
educational
systems
early
childhood
primary
and
secondary_education
curricula
it
includes
programming
with
block
languages
such
as
scratch
or
snap
a
digital
twin
of
the
system
has
also
been
implemented
in
snap
through
the
collaboration
of
a
primary_school
a
workshop
has
been
prepared
in
which
they
exercise
the
concepts
of
proportional
reasoning
such
as
ratio
proportion
scale
or
percentage
the
approach
followed
has
consisted
of
developing
a
physical
system
of
a
floating
ball
controlling
the
electric
motors
power
with
an
electronic
system
based
on
low-cost
elements
from
the
maker
world
we
have
designed
a
very
easy-to-use
system
for
any
teacher
and
its
open-source
nature
ensures
its
transparency
and
documentation
the
foam
ball
rises
and
remains
floating
at
a
height
determined
by
the
power
supplied
to
the
motor
the
control
of
the
system
is
carried
out
with
snap
it
will
be
assumed
that
the
engine
revolutions
are
proportional
to
the
power
setpoint
the
physical
system
generates
a
high
level
of
expectation
and
attention
in
the
students
facilitating
the
process
of
its
abstraction
the
range
of
options
of
the
developed
system
allows
experimenting
with
the
actual
system
and
a
schematic
digital
twin
with
sound
effects
in
all
cases
the
same
computational
thinking
tools
have
been
used
to
exercise
the
concepts
and
powerful
ideas
of
proportional
reasoning
at
the
end
of
the
workshop
the
understanding
of
the
concepts
exercised
and
the
assessment
of
their
personal
experience
were
evaluated
this
gave
us
helpful
information
to
motivate
students
of
these
ages
and
below
to
maintain
their
stem
vocation
this

is
an
outstanding
way
to

it
has
been
taken
programming
as
a

way
for

with
an
affirmative
and
quantifiable
effect
on
juniors’
achievement
not
only
in
areas
such
as
math
and
science
but
also
in
language
skills
creativity
interpersonal
skills
and
social
emotional
interaction
we
recommend
using
the
term
computation
in
conjunction
with
a
well-defined
model
of
computation
whose
semantics
is
clear
and
which
matches
the
problem
being
investigated
computer
science
already
has
a
number
of
useful
clearly
defined
models
of
computation
whose
behaviors
and
capabilities
are
well
understood
we
should
use
such
models
as
part
of
any
definition
of
the
term
computation
however
for
new
domains
of
investigation
where
there
are
no
appropriate
models
it
may
be
necessary
to
invent
new
formalisms
to
represent
the
systems
under
study
programming
is
considered
a
skill
to
arouse
and
inspire
learners
potential
learning
to
program
is
a
complex
process
that
requires
students
to
write
grammar
and
instructions
the
structure
of
a
programming
language
does
not
cause
impose
problems
to
students
the
real
obstacle
is
how
to
apply
these
learned
grammars
and
present
them
in
a
complete
and
correct
program
code
for
problem_solving
in
this

a
deep

system
was
developed
which
includes
augmented

is
provided
for

and
the
students
participating
in

although
computer
science
has
grown
to
become
one
of
the
most
highly
demanded
professional
careers
every
year
only
a
small
percentage
of
students
choose
a
degree
directly
related
to
computer

perhaps
the
problem
lies
in
the
lack
of
information
that
society
has
about
computer
science
itself
and
particularly
about
the
work
computer
scientists
do
no
one
doubts
the
role
of
mathematics
or
languages
as
core
subjects
in
every
primary
and
secondary_education
syllabus
however
computer
science
plays
a
negligible
role
in
most
current
syllabuses
only
in
a
few
countries
have
governments
paid
special
attention
to
content
related
to
computer

and
to
learning
to
analyze
and

the
way
computer

we
present
piens
computacionullmente
a
project
that
provides
a
methodology
to
promote
computer

through
computational

activities
among
primary

secondary_education
students
the
results
obtained
from
an
exhaustive
statistical
analysis
of
the
data
we
collected
demonstrate
that
the
perception
of
computer
science
that
pre-university
students
have
can
be
improved
through
specific
training
moreover
we
can
also
confirm
that
the
performance
of
pre-university
students
involving
computational
thinking
skills
is
independent
of
gender
particularly
at
the
primary_education
level
computational
thinking
is
an
essential
skill
that
allows
humans
to
solve
a
complex
problem
that
later
on
can
be
understood
by
computers
and
humans
abstraction
and
automation
are
the
core
of
computational
thinking
therefore
ct
is
the
key
skill
in
industry
40
however
in
malaysias
manufacturing
only
50
percent
of
smes
deploy
automation
automation
can
make
the
company
more
efficient
more
accurate
and
decrease
human
error
ct
was
built
based
on
4
basic
pillars
which
are
abstraction
decomposition
algorithm
and
pattern
recognition
these
pillars
will
encourage
automation
efficiency
and
innovation
moreover
one
of
the
benefits
of
ct
for
nonprogrammer
is
the
formulated
problem
can
be
passed
on
to
information-processing

understands
that
it
is
fundamental
and
strategic
for
brazil
that
computer

present
research-to-practice
full-paper
the
learning
reasoning
and
problem-solving
processes
in
engineering
students
have
been
analyzed
from
different
approaches
one
of
them
is
the
computational
thinking
process
where
most
of
the
activities
must
be
performed
as
a
computer
does
and
the
reasoning
is
developed
with
the
well-oriented
activities
realized
by
them
in
many
of
the
engineering
career
programs
the
physics
courses
are
fundamental
and
because
of
the
diversity
in
contexts
they
have
not
been
seen
as
a
subject
where
students
can
develop
the
computational
thinking
process
present
work
describes
an
empirical
study
based
on
the
learning
of
the
rigid
body
concept
in
physics
with
the
use
of
spreadsheets
as
an
electronic
tool
for
promoting
the
learning
with
the
programming
of
all
the
dynamical
system
describing
the
evolution
generating
and
analyzing
graphics
and
explaining
the
physical
phenomena
with
a
high
comprehension
and
transfer
of
knowledge
at
the
end
students
identified
where
the
concept
can
be
applied
in
their
professional
context
with
the
use
of
a
simulation
the
learning
sequence
was
implemented
in
three
sessions
of
15
hours
each
one
two
diagnostic
tests
were
applied
one
for
identifying
the
previous
knowledge
and
use
of
electronic

the
second
one
used
as
a
pretest
and
post-test
it
was
focused
on
the
main
concepts
of
the
rigid
body
system
like
forces
kinematics
and
circular
movement
the
sequence
was
implemented
with
n
77
students
session
1
started
with
the
introduction
of
electronic
spreadsheets
for
their
use
in
science
and
engineering
some
examples
in
physics
and
mathematics
were
described
with
their
respect
feedbacking
for
students
for
session
two
the
rigid
body
concept
was
described
with
the
support
of
electronic
spreadsheets
all
the
dynamics
equations
plotting
of
the
results
and
the
relationships
of
all
variables
were
described
for
reinforcing
the
concept
learned
students
were
asked
to
solve
two
more
similar
exercises
with
the
use
of
the
spreadsheets
as
homework
and
finally
they
were
asked
to
record
in
groups
of
three
students
a
video
with
the
solution
of
the
problem
assigned
in
the
video
they
must
present
the
problem
description
equations
and
dynamics
involved
in
the
solutions
and
explaining
all
the
programming
steps
needed
to
perform
the
solution
in
an
electronic
spreadsheet
with
its
graphical
representation
and
interpretation
of
the
variables
and
a
description
of
implications
in
the
changing
values
of
the
variables
in
the
mathematical
model
at
the
end
of
the
sequence
in
session
three
a
virtual
simulation
related
to
their
professional
context
was
used
for
the
reinforcement
of
all
the
concepts
learned
for
analyzing
the
impact
in
their
learning
process
the
normalized
conceptual
gain
was
used
in
the
pre-test
and
post-test
results
showed
a
g
085
which
represents
a
high
learning
and
normalized
conceptual
gain
finally
the
results
showed
that
the
computational
thinking
process
can
be
developed
by
students
as
they
must
program
equations
analyze
data
understand
it
and
identify
graphically
the
variables
involved
linking
the
learning
of
a
physical
concept
with
a
computational
tool
that
let
them
understand
in
a
more
clear
specific
and
ordered
thinking
the
solution
of
a
typical
programming
task
involves
algorithmic_thinking
pattern
recognition
decomposition
and
abstraction
skills
these
skills
are
basic
pillars
of
computational
thinking
ct
and
are
essential
for
a
computer
programmer
therefore
a
programming
teacher
needs
to
take
these
skills
into
account
for
the
evaluation
of
students
existing
methods
for
improving
programming
competency
don’t
consider
the
computational
thinking
of
students
and
perform
grading
of
students
without
taking
these
skills
into
account
due
to
this
limitation
deficiencies
of
these
skills
in
students
remain
unrevealed
posing
difficulties
for
educators
to
provide
need-oriented
feedback
the
performance
of
programming
students
is
thus
hindered
by
a
lack
of
interventions
this
study
proposes
a
method
to
evaluate
programming
students
in
terms
of
ct
skill
components
and
group
them
based
on
their
skill
set
in
this
study
780
students
of
object-oriented
programming
oop
class
were
given
programming
assignments
for
assessment
of
programming
competencies
these
students
were
then
given
small
programming
tasks
requiring
different
computational
thinking
skill
components
for
their
solutions
a
machine
learning
approach
was
used
to
perform
grouping
of
these
students
based
on
their
scores
six
groups
of
programming
students
each
having
its
own
set
of
skill
deficiencies
were
identified
as
a
result
of
clustering
one
of
the
groups
had
an
empty
set
of
skill
deficiencies
and
consisted
of
students
proficient
in
programming
each
of
the
other
five
groups
had
a
non-empty
set
of
skill
deficiencies
and
comprised
non-proficient
programming
students
a
group-specific
skill
development
plan
was
built
for
the
groups
having
skill
deficiencies
it
was
found
that
such
feedback
was
very
effective
and
improved
the
ct
skill
deficiencies
of
82
of
students
this

examine
a
new
method
of
learning
to
solve
problems
using
the
concepts
of
computer
science
named
computational
thinking
which
is
a
new
term
emerged
in
the
last
decade
and
was
the
subject
of
experts
researchers
associations
scientific
bodies
and
academic
institutions
we
will
study
the
approach
of
computational
thinking
and
then
we
will
develop
this
approach
through
a
descriptive
methodology
based
mainly
on
the
specification
and
algorithms
and
achieve
the
concepts
of
computational
thinking
called
relational
algorithmic
approach
and
highlight
the
effectiveness
of
this
methodology
in
education
computational
thinking
is
one
barrier
to
enculturating
as
a
professional
engineer
we
created
the
engineering
computational
thinking
diagnostic
ectd
as
an
instructional
tool
that
can
identify
at-risk
first-year
engineering
students
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
provide
construct
validity
internal
consistency
reliability
item
characteristics
and
criterion
validity
evidence
for
this
diagnostic
from
fall
2020
to
fall
2021
469
students
from
three
institutions
in
the
united
states
took
the
diagnostic
the
data
from
152
students
at
one
institution
was
used
to
provide
evidence
of
predictive
validity
exploratory
and
confirmatory
factor
analyses
resulted
in
20
items
loading
onto
one

cronbach
alpha
of
086
from
item
analyses
based
on
classical_test_theory
the
diagnostic
items
on
average
tended
to
be
slightly
easy
but
had
sufficient
discrimination
power
the
correlation
matrix
for
criterion
validity
evidence
indicated
that
the
diagnostic
functions
well
to
differentiate
students’
computational
thinking
ability
by
prior
computer
science
course
experience
as
well
as
by
first-generation
status
predictive
validity
evidence
from
regression
analyses
revealed
the
statistically
significant
effect
of
students’
diagnostic
scores
assessed
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
semester
on
predicting
their
end
of
semester
course
grades
the
ectd
can
have
a
broad
impact
because
it
provides
a
tool
to
gauge
the
entry-level
skills
of
students
enabling
early
curriculum
interventions
to
help
retention
and
persistence
to
graduation
we
make
the
case
that
the
ectd
could
contribute
to
the
development
of
a
more
diverse
workforce
in
engineering
based
on
the
analysis
of
some
famous
instructional
cases
in
programming
education
and
in-depth
interviews
with
primary_school
teachers
who
are
engaged
in

this
paper
focuses
on
the
instructional
procedure
and
strategies
of
primary_school
programming

this
examination
reveals
the
current
situation
and
possible

the
article
founds
that
the
instructional
procedure
of
cultivating
computational
thinking
in
programming
education
generally
involves
five
major
stages
knowledge
review
new
knowledge
exploration

and
the
stage
of

and
more
finally
the
paper
concludes
with
the
problems
that
appeared
in
teaching
especially
in
the
stage
of
new
knowledge
exploration
unplugged

and
pair-programming
we
conducted
a
systematic
review
of
studies
aimed
at
exploring
the
state
of
parental
involvement
in
computational
thinking
ct
education
to
facilitate
students’
efficiency
in
learning
computational
thinking
in
this
review
we
started
with
reviewing
theories
of
parental
involvement
then
we
investigated
and
categorized
types
of
parental
involvement
parent
roles
and
parents’
psychological
factors
in
the
parenting
process
we
also
supplemented
a
new
involvement
form
in
level
2
of
hoover-dempsey
and
sandler’s
model
of
parental
involvement
in
ct
education
namely
parents’
support
with
concerns
about
using
technology
and
ct
tools
we
proposed
the
model
of
parental
involvement
in
computational
thinking
education
we
conducted
comprehensive
research
of
related
studies
on
parental
involvement
in
ct
education
and
identified
the
research
gap
in
involving
parents
in
children’s
ct
learning
computational
thinking
is
considered
an
important
skill
set
for
21st-century
learners
and
became
a
subject
of
focus
in
k-12
education
in
recent
years
it
cultivates
problem-solving
and
algorithmic_thinking
and
can
be
helpful
in
wider
aspects
of
everyday
life
besides
programming
and
computer
science
in
this
paper
we
investigated
what
is
the
greek
primary
and
secondary_school
teachers’
understanding
and
awareness
as
far
as
computational
thinking
is
concerned
since
teachers
are
the
agents
of
change
it
is
critical
to
find
out
how
familiar
andor
skilled
they
are
with
the
computational
thinking
notion
thus
we
applied
a
qualitative
questionnaire
all
over
the
whole
greek
state
where
406
teachers
answered
the
study
led
to
a
number
of
interesting
conclusions
regarding
the
teacher’s
readiness
as
well
as
more
generic
aspects
according
to
their
profile
and
faculty
computational
thinking
ct
is
considered
as
the
skill
of
21st
century
the
fundamental
ct
concepts
include
abstraction
algorithm
design
decomposition
pattern
recognition
and
data
representation
or
generalization
ct
assessment
is
required
to
improve
the
understanding
of
the
cognitive
abilities
and
to
relate
them
in
related
areas
such
as
introductory
programming
in
computer
science
assessing
computational
thinking
skills
however
is
a
challenging
issue
since
it
measures
latent
variables
that
cannot
be
directly
observed
in
addition
according
to
psychometrics
appropriate
test
requires
a
validation
process
before
it
can
be
effectively
used
as
a
measuring
instrument
thus
high
quality
tools
for
measuring
student
learning
in
introductory
programming
have
been
under-developed
and
under-researched
the
objective
of
this
work
is
to
determine
the
psychometric
properties
item
validity
reliability
discrimination
difficulty
and
distractors
of
the
developed
multiple-choice
questions
of
computational
thinking
in
introductory
programming
by
exploring
classical_test_theory
and
item_response_theory
which
has
not
been
deeply
investigated
by
previous
studies
the
analysis
results
reveal
that
most
of
items
are
valid
and
the
items
are
generally
adequate
reliable
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
some
items
are
suggested
to
be
revised
since
the

the
distribution
of

and
distractor
points
are
less

has
been
integrated
into
teaching
of
engineering
and
computer

this
study
proposes
a

to
promote
the
infusion
of

or
the
problem-solving
process
driven
by
computer

concepts
has
been
acclaimed
as
a
basic
skill
of
the
21st
century
in
this
context
several
researches
have
been
developed
to
insert
computational

the
objective
of
this
work
is
to
investigate
the
use
of
tools
to
support
the
teaching-learning
of
computational
thinking
in
the
national
scenario
for
this
a
systematic
mapping
of
the
literature
was
carried
out
using
articles
published
in
events
and
periodical
of
national
relevance
for
the
analysis
21
papers
published
between
2014
and
2017
were
selected
the
results
of
this
mapping
are
a
the
identification
of
the
tools
used
b
what
resources
are
required
for
the
development
of
such
tools
and
c
what
benefits
students
have
been
reported
in
using
the
tools
sorting
is
an
algorithmic
concept
that
is
covered
in
every
fundamental
computer
science
and
engineering
course
and
included
in
most
if
not
all
programming
competitions
it
is
an
everyday
task
self-taught
and
done
naturally
even
by
a
small
child
in
spite
of
its
ingenuousness
mastering
sorting
algorithms
turns
out
to
be
not
so
simple
for
many
first-time
programmers
this
happens
because
how
humans
perform
sorting
is
far
from
being
straightforwardly
aligned
with
machine
instructions
we
have
developed
an
unplugged
game-based_learning
activity
that
aims
not
only
to
tackle
this
difficult
dilemma
but
also
to
promote
computational
thinking
practice
our
game
robustly
challenges
audiences
to
complete
a
fun
sorting
task
algorithmically
and
the
building
blocks
of
the
exercise
are
methodologically
grounded
in
the
four
cornerstones
of
computational
thinking
participants
are
gently
guided
through
solving
a
problem
by
decomposing
it
recognizing
patterns
applying
abstraction
writing
step-by-step
instructions
and
finally
arriving
at
a
programmable
solution
our
design
is
largely
flexible
the
game
can
be
played
in
small
groups
or
larger
ones
it
uses
only
common
readily
accessible
materials
and
is
easily
adaptable
to
different
levels
of
audiences
from
the
interested
general
public
to
secondary_school
students
and
teachers
to
non-computer
science
undergraduates
and
those
majoring
in
engineering
or
information
technology
related
subjects
we
have
implemented
this
activity
in
our
classrooms
and
conducted
several
workshops
responses
were
markedly
positive
engaged
from
the
beginning
to
the
end

audiences
were
captivated
by
many
surprising
challenges
most
notably
they
were
able
to
comprehend
the
concepts
of
sorting

the
computational
steps
behind
them

this
paper
explores
the
potential
for
simplified
programming
languages
to
support
the
development
of
computational

skills
in
nonprogrammers
we
suggest
that
novice
programming

might
offer
a
starting
point
for
nonprogrammers
to
engage
with
a
substantial
subset
of
computational
thinking
concepts
and
assess
a
number
of
languages
from
this
perspective
we
outline
four
key
computational
thinking
skills
and
examine
the
support
provided
by
existing
languages
we
then
describe
additional
characteristics
which
would
be
important
for
a
new

aimed
specifically
at
developing

the
outbreak
of
covid-19
has
impacted
traditional
teaching
methods
in
schools
and
blended
teaching
in
the
post-pandemic
has
gradually
become
a
hot
topic
of
research
in
higher_education
computational
thinking
as
one
of
the
core
literacies
to
be
acquired
in
the
21st
century
can
help
students
realize
the
importance
of
computers
as
well
as
enable
them
to
solve
specific
problems
more
effectively
when
facing
real-life
situations
the
article
takes
the
c
language
programming
course
as
an
example
analyzes
the
problems
faced
in
teaching
in
the
post-pandemic
introduces
the
concept
of
computational
thinking
and
integrates
it
into
all
aspects
of
blended

design
pays
attention
to
students
individual
differences
and
proposes
a
blended

model
based
on
computational

and
puts
it
into

the
results
show
that
this

this
research
purpose
is
to
figure
out
whether
educational
robotics
is
a
strategy
to
develop
young
childrens
computational

the
method
used
in
this
research
was
quantitative
with
a
descriptive
exploratory
scope
with
an
inductive-deductive
approach
the
sample
consisted
of
28
students
taken
from
the
population
of
the
tenth-grade
students
of
“santa
mariana
de

high_school
the
technique
used
was
the

collection
instrument
was
a

at
the
beginning
pre-test
and
at
the
end
of
the
process
post

a
during
the
last
two
decades
educational
robotics
became
a
popular
tool
for
teaching
stem
concepts
to
audiences
of
all
levels
yet
its
use
for
teaching
programming
with
university-level
non-stem
audiences
has
not
been
researched
so
far
this
work
presents
a
new
educational
activity
designed
for
teaching
programming
to
non-stem
university-level
audiences
the
key
aspect
is
a
separation
of
teaching
programming
concepts
and
programming
language
and
therefore
complexity
reduction
in
learning
the
concepts
are
introduced
using
educational
robotics
and
later
on
students
learn
how
to
use
the
concepts
in
the
context
of
the
python
programming
language
two
teaching
approaches
direct
instruction
and
productive
failure
along
with
a
capstone
challenge
are
deployed
and
their
relationship
to
educational
robotics
is
observed
computers
cause
an
impact
in
almost
every
single
aspect
of
our
lives
however
unfortunately
schools
have
not
been
able
to
keep
up
with
this
irreversible
evolution
the
simple
use
of
technological
apparatuses
in
the
classroom
does
not
guarantee
the
improvement
of
the
learning
process
however
it
can
be
the
medium
through
which
the
students
find
the
alternatives
for
the
solution
of
complex
problems
the
computational
thinking
is
an
approach
of
teaching
that
uses
a
diverse
range
of
techniques
derived
from
computers
for
the
resolution
of
these
problems
combined
with
the
new
competencies
of
the

the
adoption
of
the
notion
of

within
the
basic
education
schools
is
a
concern
in
many
countries
where
the
implementation
occurs
in
a
strict
way
admittedly
it
grows
the
idea
that
the
computing
discipline
is
very
distinct
from
the
computer
classes
and
that
the
use
of
skills
from
computing
possesses
educational
reflection
and
problem_solving
the
comprehension
that
the

is
ingrained
with
the

classrooms
that
promote
active

through
the
use
of

one
of
the
main
objectives
of
the

program
is
to
facilitate
the
professional
development
of
graduate
students
in
computing-rich
fields
such
as
engineering
computer

and
biology
through
leadership
development
public
speaking
experience
and
an
enhanced
vision
of
how
ct
is
vital
to
in
all
scientific
disciplines
the
alliances
formed
between

principles
and
equips
them
with
the
ability
to

this
paper
thoroughly
describes
specific
modules
that
integrate
ct
concepts
into
the
traditional
6th
grade
science
curriculum
the
statistical
results
of
assessments
gauging
the
development
of
ct
skills
and
knowledge
during
the
course
of
one
academic
year
and
suggestions
for
improvements
and
incorporation
into
other
curricula
while
specialized
knowledge
and
skills
are
the
hallmark
of
modern
society
the
size
and
complexity
of
contemporary
problems
often
require
cooperative
effort
to
analyze
and
solve
therefore
experiences
with
skills
methodologies
and
tools
for
effective
interdisciplinary
collaboration
and
structured
problem_solving
are
vital
for
preparing
students
for
future
academic
and
professional
success
meanwhile
computational
systems
have
permeated
much
of
modern
professional
and
personal
life
making
computational
thinking
an
essential
skill
for
members
of
modern
society
however
formal
training
in
these
techniques
is
primarily
limited
to
students
within
computer
science
mathematics
management
of
information
systems
and
engineering
at
iowa
state
university
we
have
designed
and
offered
an
experimental
course
to
develop
undergraduate
students
abilities
for
interdisciplinary
teamwork
and
to
disseminate
computational
thinking
skills
to
a
broader
range
of
students
this
novel
course
was
jointly
designed
and
instructed
by
faculty
from
the
computer
science
department
gerontology
program
and
graphic
design
program
to
incorporate
diverse
faculty
expertise
and
pedagogical
approaches
students
were
required
to
interview
real
users
to
identify
real-life
problems
gather
requirements
and
assess
candidate
solutions
which
necessitated
communication
both
within
the
group
and
with
technologically-disinclined
users
in-class
presentations
and
wiki-based
project
websites
provided
regular
practice
at
disseminating
domain
expertise
to
larger
interdisciplinary
audiences
workshops
group-based
mentoring
peer
learning
and
guided
discovery
allowed
non-cs
majors
to
learn
much
more
about
computer
programs
and
tools
and
grading
criteria
held
students
individually
accountable
within
their
disciplines
but
also
emphasized
group
collaboration
this
paper
summarizes
the
design
and
preliminary
outcomes
from
the
deployment
of
the
dissect
discovering
science
through
computational
thinking
project
the
project
has
two
primary
objectives
on
one
hand
it
aims
to
revitalize
the
teaching
of
traditional
k-12
science
concepts
through
the
introduction
of
tools
and
concepts
drawn
from
the
field
of
computing
enabling
the
use
of
interactive
and
constructive
methods
to
exemplify
and
explore
scientific
materials
on
the
other
hand
the
project
explores
how
the
teaching
of
sciences
could
become
a
vehicle
to
engage
students
in
the
learning
of
computational
thinking
stimulating
their
interest
towards
this
discipline
and
providing
them
with
a
baseline
preparation
to
facilitate
access
and
success
in
more
formal
computer
science
courses
we
introduce
the
idea
of
a
symbolic
description
of
a
complex
human
learning
task
in
order
to
contribute
to
better
understand
how
we
learn
the
learner
is
modeled
on
the
basis
of
knowledge
from
learning
sciences
with
the
contribution
of
cognitive
neurosciences
including
machine
learning
formalism
in
the
very
precise
framework
of
a
task
named
creacube
reviewed
here
related
to
initiation
to
computational
thinking
presented
as
an
open-ended
problem
which
involves
solving
a
problem
and
appealing
to
creativity
we
target
problem-solving
tasks
using
tangible
interfaces
for
computational
thinking
initiation
and
describe
in
details
how
we
model
the
task
and
the
learner
behavior
in
this
task
including
goal-driven
versus
stimulus-driven
behavior
and
the
learner
knowledge
construction
we
show
how
formalizing
these
elements
using
an
ontology
offers
a
well-defined
computational
model
and
the
possibility
of
inferences
about
model
elements
analyzing
and
predicting
the
learner
behavior
this
operationalization
of
a
creative
problem-solving
task
is
still
at
a
preliminary
stage
but
an
effective
proof
of
concept
is
described
in
this
study
research
and
full
paper
digital
games
are
increasingly
a
part
of
our
daily
lives
and
are
already
considered
teaching
and
learning
tools
however
its
production
and
documentation
is
a
very
complicated
task
that
requires
programming
skills
and
knowledge
from
different
areas
this
has
hampered
the
development
of
games
in
the
classroom
environment
on
the
other
hand
some
teachers
have
proposed
this
activity
to
enable
their
students
to
learn
school
content
in
a
more
meaningful
way
and
consequently
improve
learning
rates
an
alternative
for
the
adoption
of
game-based_learning
is
an
unplugged
approach
for
creating
games
based
on
natural
language
in
which
students
learn
the
fundamentals
of
computing
in
a
playful
way
and
without
the
use
of
computers
in
this
context
this
article
presents
an
approach
that
proposes
the
creation
of
games
in
an
unplugged
way
by
using
texts
produced
by
students
thus
favoring
the
development
of
computational
thinking
and
reading
and
writing
skills
in
the
classroom
also
it
may
support
the
students
interest
in
the
computing
area
by
motivating
them
to
enter
a
higher_education
course
or
pursue
a
career
in
that
area
the
results
of
the
exploratory
study
show
that
the
proposed
approach
can
favor
the
development
of
computational
thinking
as
well
as
motivate
the
production
of
texts
developing
students
reading
and
writing
skills
therefore
contributing
to
the
improvement
of
learning
assessments
computational
thinking
ct
has
been
identified
in
the
last
few
years
as
a
fundamental
skill
that
should
be
developed
by
all
people
this
has
motivated
multiple
initiatives
whether
governmental
through
organizations
or
by
individuals
however
upon
realizing
a
literature
review
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
no
initiatives
that
include
minority
groups
such
as
those
within
the
autism
spectrum
disorder
asd
were
proposed
furthermore
in
this
context
there
are
no
guidelines
to
orientate
the
creation
of
didactic
activities
that
will
bring
about
the
benefits
of
ct
due
to
the
aforementioned
information
in
this
article
we
present
the
definition
of
a
collection
of
guidelines
for
the
construction
of
didactic
activities
ct4aii
that
aim
to
promote
computational
thinking
in
adolescents
with
asd
through
the
construction
of
digital
games
the
proposed
guidelines
were
instantiated
in
a
digital
games
programming
workshop
with
scratch
the
workshop
was
offered
to
four
adolescents
with
asd
obtaining
the
development
of
high-level
ct
skills
and
stimulating
interpersonal
skills
that
are
diminished
in
this
public
furthermore
a
posttest
was
executed
5
months
later
with
the
objective
of
determining
if
the
developed
skills
had
been
maintained
over
time
the
results
evidenced
that
the
skills
were
in
fact
maintained
in
a
sustained
manner
demonstrating
promising
results
computational
thinking
is
a
competence
that
is
developed
more
in
the
last
few
years
this
is
due
to
the
multitude
of
benefits
it
has
in
the
classroom
throughout
this
article
we
show
a
series
of
activities
that
promote
the
development
of
computational
thinking
using
tools
that
allow
visual
block_programming
the
particularity
of
these
activities
is
that
some
of
them
were
performed
during
the
confinement
due
to
the
covid-19
and
other
activities
were
performed
later
in
the
period
known
as
the
new
normality
throughout
the
article
details
are
provided
about
the
different
sessions
the
different
visual
programming
tools
by
blocks
and
the
educational
scenarios
used
are
also
indicated
in
addition
the
results
obtained
are
shown
the
present
work
proposes
the
creation
of
a
virtual
reality
tool
that
allows
students
to
learn
basic
concepts
of
programming
and
computational
thinking
with
the
purpose
that
they
enjoy
the
technology
and
feel
motivated
to
learn
more
the
tool
is
a
visual
programming
language
the
algorithms
are
formed
by
block-assembly
thereby
solving
one
of
the
students
main
problems
which
are
in
the
light
of
the
involvement
of

technologies
teaching
the
concepts
of
computer

programming
and
algorithms
has
become
necessarywe
study
in
this
article
the
approach
of
computational
thinking
and
then
we
develop
this
approach
through
a
descriptive
methodology
based
mainly
on
the
specification
and
algorithms
and
achieve
the
concepts
of
computational
thinking
called
relational
algorithmic_thinking
approach
and
highlight
the
effectiveness
of
this
methodology
in
education
due
to
the
popularity
and
development
of
computer
science
the
connection
between
computer
science
and
other

ct
has
been
widely
used
to
improve

however
there
is
a
scarcity
of
information
available
regarding
the
challenges
faced
by
students
and
the
development
of
their
conceptual
knowledge
in

there
is
a
need
to
help
with

for
such
there
is
a
need
to

our
purpose
is
to
find
if

are
still
relevant
and
can

investigate
an
alternative
way
of
determining
the

therefore
we
downloaded
250
projects
of

online
platform
and
identified
the
differences
and
clustered
them
based
on
a
quantitative
measure
the

score
provided
by

scratch
we
then
triangulated
the
results
by
qualitatively
studying
in

the

code
of
the
prototypical
projects
to
explain
the
progression
required
to
move

an
essential
21st-century
competency
that

this
paper
explores
whether
the
computational
thinking
practices
of
mathematicians
and
scientists
in
the
physical
and
biological
sciences
are
also
the
practices
of
archival
scientists
it
is
argued
that
these
practices
are
essential
elements
of
an
archival

education
in
preparing
students
for
a
professional
archival
career
the
pervasiveness
of
computer
devices
in
everyday
situations
poses
a
fundamental
question
about
computer
sciences
as
being
part
of
those
known
as
basic
sciences
however
it
would
be
more
beneficial
not
to
consider
computation
only
as
a
technique
but
instead
as
a
way
of
reasoning
and
problem_solving
under
this
perspective
there
are
inherent
relationships
among
the
knowledge
skills
and
attitudes
that
emanate
from
this
field
and
those
ones
commonly
related
to
math
this
paper
discusses
the
relationship
between
the
so-named
computational
thinking
and
the
foundations
of
math
education
based
on
a
literature
review
three
groups
of
skills
that
can
be
jointly
developed
by
both
areas
are
identified
and
some
challenges
and
implications
for
education
in
computer
sciences
are
discussed
aspiring
software
developers
like
the
novice
students
in
computer
science
courses
need
to
acquire
a
thorough
understanding
of
fundamental
computational_concepts
like
sequential
execution
conditional
branching
loops
modularisation
hierarchy
and
reuse
this
understanding
and
digital
tools
have
become
more
essential
in
education
and
business
areas
these
days
and
it
is
important
to
start
in
the
early
stages
of
education
eg
already
in
the
preschool
stage
this
paper
describes
the
development
and
pilot
testing
of
an
android
based
serious
gaming
app
for
mobile
devices
called
pic2program
the
app
aims
to
teach
children
the
basics
of
computational
thinking
ct
in
a
playful
way
the
gameplay
expects
the
young
children
to
steer
successfully
their
in-game
character
with
the
help
of
an
intuitive
symbol
language
through
a
set
of
increasingly
complex
mazes
the
children
may
even
draw
sets
of
symbols
by
hand
thus
develop
a
basic
program
pic2programs
image
recognition
module
will
then
process
these
symbols
by
first
photographing
them
with
an
android
device
and
then
using
a
neural
network
to
map
the
photos
to
program
instructions
the
effectivity
of
pic2program
on
learning
ct
has
been
evaluated
by
a
designed
course
for
9th
graders
the
results
show
that
students
find
the
app
well-structured
and
help
them
to
understand
the
basics
of
programming
at
the
core
of
every
computing
related
discipline
and
impacting
everyone
everywhere
computational
thinking
or
ct
has
increasingly
emerged
as
its
own
subject
in
all
levels
of
education
how
to
effectively
teach
ct
skills
poses
real
challenges
and
creates
opportunities
focusing
on
engineering
and
computer
science
undergraduates
we
resourcefully
integrated
elements
of
artificial
intelligence
ai
into
introductory
computing
courses
in
addition
to
a
comprehension
of
the
essence
of
ct
ai
enabled
inspirations
of
collaborative
problem_solving
beyond
abstraction
logical
reasoning
critical
and
analytical
thinking
it
fostered
the
study
of
basic

they
constructed
essential
knowledge
from

every
activity
is
designed
to
allow
students
to
fully
engage
their
mental
tools
neither
coding
nor
programming
was
required
in
this
paper
we
analyzed
whether
the
ability
of
students
to
solve
problems
can
be
influenced
by
the
implementation
of
computational
thinking
ct
in
the
teaching
of
mathematics
in
this
sense
we
performed
a
quasi-experiment
with
students
in
the
brazilians
basic
education
regular
system
particularly
in
a
group
of
students
around
fifteen
years
old
comparing
their
performance
after
being
trained
with
practical
activities
using
exercises
in
more
or
less
conformity
with
well
known
ct
concepts
and
capabilities
considering
the
quantitative
results
obtained
the
experimental
group
outperformed
the
control
group
which
worked
with
exercises
in
more
and
less
conformity
with
ct
respectively
the
results
were
statistically
significant
suggesting
that
bringing
together
ct
and
mathematics
through
proper
adjustments
of
classroom
practices
can
have
a
positive
influence
on
students
abilities
of
solving
problems
in
order
to
strengthen
this
conclusion
we
also
performed
a
qualitative
analysis
comprising
students
and
the
teacher
involved
in
the
quasi-experiment
that
reinforced
our
quantitative
results
developing
students
computational
thinking
ct
which
is
an
essential
problem-solving
skill
for
people
living
in
the
21st
century
becomes
an
outstanding
purpose
of
promoting
engineering
education
in
k-12
classrooms
in
this
paper
ct
is
represented
through
the
graphical
programming
language

according
to
the
three-dimensional
ct
framework
proposed
by
brennan
and
resnick

this
project
aims
to
explore
the
classroom
effect
of
using
graphical
programming
tool
in
learning
english
dialogue
and
investigate
how
to
improve
the
integration
of
ct
into
english
education
with
the
elements
of
programming
to
achieve
these
objectives
a
qualitative
method
was
adopted
to
collect
data
through
class
observations
programming
projects
and
semi-structured
interviews
nine
primary
students
n

were
the
targeted
participants
who
attended
extra-curricular
lessons
for
computer
programming
using
scratch
at
their
school
in
hong
kong
the
preliminary
results
show
that
the
introduction
of
ct
into
english
dialogue
learning
through
graphical
programming
language
can
motivate
primary_school
students
to
study
english
dialogue
to
better
connect
ct
with
english
education
via
graphical
programming
tools
students
and
the
teacher
in
the
group
under
study
suggested
making
computers
interact
with
people
autonomically
designing
games
in
graphical
programming
environments
to
encourage
english
learning
keeping
the
balance
of
students
graphical
programming
language
learning
skill
and
their
english
language
skill
and
adopting
graphical
programming
language
as
a
tool
to
finish
the
summative
english
language
assignments
scratch
is
a
programming
environment
which
is
widely
adopted
as
the
first
language
to
enter
the
programming
world
since
scratch
projects
are
rich
in
multimedia
resources
it
can
be
time-consuming
to
judge
them
by
hand
requiring
manual
execution
with
the
understanding
of
each
project
auto-judgment
tools
come
into
being
they
can
rapidly
evaluate
the
project
in
some
way
unfortunately
the
existing
tools
are
too
rigid
and
they
ignore
the
diversity
of
scratch
projects
to
address
this
issue
we
propose
a
new
dynamic
weighted
evaluation
system
dwes
first
we
define
a
new
computational
thinking
ct
evaluation
criteria
from
eight
aspects
second
based
on
the
proposed
criteria
we
present
an
analysis
tool
that
automatically
assesses
the
ct
skills
of
the
learners’
projects
third
considering
the
characteristics
of
projects
we
dynamically
adjust
the
evaluation
results
according
to
types
so
that
a
single
standard
is
no
longer
applied
roughly
to
all
this
process
is
data-driven
we
consider
the
ct
performance
and
scripts
of
projects
we
prove
the
rationality
of
the
evaluation
criteria
from
the
aspect
of
program
complexity
through
the
correlation
analysis
between
dwes
ct
scores
and
experts’
ratings
we
find
that
compared
with
dr
scratch
the
correlation
coefficient
has
increased
the
computational
thinking
ct
conceptual
framework
is
entering
its
second
decade
of
research
yet
still
lacks
a
cohesive
definition
by
which
the
field
can
coalesce
the
lack
of
clear
definition
makes
assessment
tool
challenging
to
formulate
pedagogical
efforts
difficult
to
compare
and
research
difficult
to
synthesize
this
paper
looks
to
operationalize
differing
definitions
of
ct
enhancing
the
ability
to
teach
then
assess
the
presence
of
ct
expanding
upon
ct
definitions
industry
practices
and
processes
and
educational
theory
we
link
existing
concepts
and
propose
a
new
element
to
model
an
active
definition
of
ct
as
a
theoretical
framework
to
guide
future
research
our
model
updates
existing
ct
definition
by
formally
including
modeling
introducing
socio-technical
processes
separating
information
gathering
from
data
collection
and
adding
emphasis
to
testing
as
a
vital
ct
concept
we
feel
these
elements
and
interconnections
make
ct
is
easier
to
describe
and
measure
computational
thinking
ct
skills
are
generally
regarded
as
a
basic
ability
for
problem-solving
and
are
gradually
filtering
down
to
younger
age
groups
existing
research
has
attempted
to
increase
interaction
and
enhance
the
learning
interest
of
elementary_school
students
through
block-based
programming
environments
represented
by
scratch
however
criticism
suggests
that
this
approach
has
potential
long-term
constraints
on
ct
education
therefore
this
study
designed
a
game-based
project
to
investigate
students’
learning
motivation
and
ct
performance
in
different
programming
environments
a
total
of
108
fifth-grade
students
participated
in
the
experiment
and
were
divided
into
two
experimental
groups
eg1
and
eg2
and
a
control
group
cg
the
students
in
experimental
groups
all
undertook
game-based_learning
while
eg1
students
used
c
and
eg2
students
used
scratch
cg
students
used
c
for
traditional
algorithm-based
learning
findings
suggest
that
traditional
programming
languages
with
game-based_learning
can
also
substantially
improve
learning
interest
which
can
promote
the
efficiency
of
improving
ct
for
students
who
already
have
some
motivation
and
foundation
for
learning
but
for
students
who
still
lack
motivation
are
also
encouraged
to
develop
an
interest
in
a
block-based
programming
environment
teachers
can
choose
the
most
appropriate
approach
for
students
to
find
the
best
balance
between
learning
efficiency
and
long-term
interest
many
countries
have
included
or
consider
to
include
computational
thinking
in
their
educational
curricula
this
creates
the
need
for
a
carefully
planned
educational
approach
involving
different
stakeholders
as
policymakers
educators
and
students
these
stakeholders
are
the
main
carriers
of
the
educational
reforms
thus
their
perspectives
create
various
challenges
and
risks
in
this
paper
we
propose
a
pedagogical
approach
of
teaching

through
games
and
gamification
of
the

used
in

the

confirm
the
benefits
of
the

the
growing

ct
has
led
to
an
expanding

lesson
is
that

therefore
we
address
its

with
the
aim
of
making
its

clearer
in

we
first
present
several

extracted
from
a

then
the
main

shows
that
such

are
ambiguous
and
heterogeneous
depending
on
each

they
refer
to
concepts

the
algorithmic_thinking
which
is
required
to
solve
the

established

also
to

therefore
being

cybersecurity
is
of
similar
importance
however
it
can
be
difficult
for
young
learners
to
grasp
the
required
concepts
and
use
them
to
construct
meaningful
algorithms
we
discuss
our
approach
that
combines
a
hands-on
robotics
platform
with
a
block-based
programming
environment
to
facilitate
the
learning
and
application
of
cybersecurity
and
ct
concepts
throughout
a
week-long
intervention
high_school
students
were
introduced
to
cybersecurity
and
ct
and
given
the
opportunity
to
apply
this
knowledge
in
a
collaborative
setting
to
solve
security
problems
on
the
robotics
platform
with
instructor
and
peer
support
a
series
of
competitions
between
groups
of
students
further
motivated
students
to
translate
their
learned
concepts
to
practice
often
leading
to
breakthroughs
as
students
incorporated
new
algorithms
into
their
existing
projects
to
counteract
previous
security
flaws
we
present
evidence
of
the

of
several
such

through
mixed-method
case
studies
integrating

collected
from

we
discuss
the

of
this
approach

then
present
future
directions
for
this

ct
paper
published
in

set
forth
ct
as
not
just
a
way
of
looking
at
computational
problems
but
as
an
alternative
approach
to
solving
everyday
problems
we
strongly
support
wings
assertion
accordingly
we
report
the
results
of
our
meta-analysis
of
ct
curricular
implementations
since
2006
our
principle
interest
is
in
ct
framings
and
implementations
for
k-12
audiences
in
disciplines
other
than
computer
science
thus
fulfilling
the
broad
appeal
and
utility
originally
prescribed
by
wing
we
break
ct
down
into
its
constituent
characteristics
and
split
these
characteristics
into
two
principle
groups
mechanistic
inextricably
tied
to
and
limited
by
computer
science
and
humanistic
separable
from
and
adaptable
beyond
computer
science
we
use
this
conceptual
bifurcation
as
a
basis
for
selecting
and
analyzing
implementations
of
ct
for
subsequent
reporting
we
summarize
our
ct
meta-analytical
results
by
distributional
themes
including
grades
disciplinary
foci
equity
groups
and
programming
paradigms
in
conclusion
we
make
recommendations
for
improving
k-12
ct
curricular
implementations
our
hope
is
that
utilization
of
ct
characteristics
and
principles
will
become
more
commonplace
in
public
education
be
utilized
more
continuously
through
primary
and
secondary
grades
and
be
inventively
applied
across
a
more
inclusive
range
of
academic
disciplines
the
primary
issue
of
garbage
is
its
direct
impact
on
the
environment
and
quality
of
life
several
types
of
trash
have
piled
up
in
thailand
many
individuals
don’t
use
the
correct
way
of
waste
management
because
they
have
lacked
knowledge
and
understanding
of
how
to
sort
rubbish
since
childhood
to
increase
the
possibility
to
fully
utilize
the
knowledge
of
waste
separation
correctly
the
researcher
aims
to
promote
computational
thinking
through
the
learning
of
a
game
called
“trashman”
this
game
simulates
various
objects
for
situations
of
sorting
garbage
into
the
appropriate
sorting
bin
trashman
has
3
levels
in
the
game
each
level
increases
the
number
of
bins
and
the
amount
of
garbage
starting
from
level
1-3
which
refers
to
easy
moderate
and
difficult
levels
respectively
the
level
indicates
the
error
of
separating
the
waste
if
putting
it
into
a
wrong
bin
type
the
educating
about
different
types
of
waste
separation
through
the
game
utilizes
mixed
reality
mr
technology
of
the
magic
leap
one
device
the
developer’s
expectation
for
an
alternative
learning
medium
in
the
form
of
a
game
is
to
allow
players
to
apply
their
knowledge
by
practicing
computational
skills
by
sorting
garbage
correctly
the
game
evaluates
and
summarizes
scores
of
each
level
at
the
game’s
end
this
will
evaluate
player’s
performance
of
ct
through
their
ability
separating
trash
moreover
the
sustainable
development

can
be
applied
for
lifelong

to
design

a
program
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
deep
knowledge
about
the
meaning
of
ct
and
its
targets
although
ct
skills
are
of
paramount
importance
to
all
since
they
bring
numerous
advantages
for
problem_solving
activities
in
our
context
we
see
them
as
a
pre-requisite
for
the
learning
of
computer
programming
cp
in
order
to
design
a
ct
training
program
supported
by
a
rigorous
framework
we
decided
to
build
an
ontology
that
goes
deeper
into
the
underlying

relates
both
domains

aiming
to
build
a

finally
we
demonstrate
through

how
the
characterization
of
a
concrete

is
performed
in

one
of
the
methods
to
develop
ct

thus
contributing

project-based_learning

are
widely
favored
by

students
these
abilities
are
crucial
several
studies
claim
that

have
deficits
in
many
of
the
ct
skills
and
therefore
it
is
important
to
develop
and
improve
these

for

purpose
teachers
responsible

have
to
plan

effective

there
are
already
many

for

however
we
believe
that

can
contribute
to
improving
the
impact
of

lr
in

process
currently
educational
neuroscience
presents
a
solid
set
of
scientific
evidence
on
how
the

effectively
this
important
knowledge
about
the

process
can
be
turned
into
principles
applicable
in

this

starts
emphasising
those
principles
that
can
benefit
the

based
on
this
scientific

we
propose
the
adoption
of
a

that
can
contribute

neuroeducation
applies
the
latest
theoretical
advances
in

human

the
guidelines
inspired
by

that
we
propose
here
aim
to
provide
instructions
for
the
teacher
to
apply
in
their
pedagogical
practices

in

in
order
to
promote
more
effective

one

be
used

our
proposal
in

to
expand

cs
there
is
a

push
for

for
broadening

learning
opportunities
addressing
potential
self-selection
bias
associated
with

cs
coursework
and
afterschool
programs
and
promoting
a
more
expansive

emerging
research
also
points
to
pedagogical
strategies
that
can
transcend
simply
broadening
access
by
also
working
to
confront
barriers
to
equitable
and
inclusive
engagement
in
cs
yet
approaches
to

vary
widely
and
there
is
little
consensus
on
whether
and
how
different
models
for
cs
and
ct
integration
contribute
to
desired
outcomes
there
has
also
been
little
theory
development
that
can
ground
systematic
examination
of
the

tradeoffs
of

toward

end
we
propose
a
typology

to
examine

ct
s
the
purpose
of
delineating
a
typology
of
cts

is
to
encourage

to
promote

at
the

characterize

provides
evidence
that

require
the

all

are
often
designed

where
children
work
together
to
achieve

objectives
although

occur
frequently
humans
unlike

very
good
at
overcoming

with
the
aim
of
equipping

in
this

we
investigate
how
a

collaborate
with
a
human
learner
to
construct
a

to
a

concretely
we
designed
a

aiming
to
improve
the

in
which
the

makes
suggestions
on

that
may
be
in

furthermore
the

essentially
prevent

we
investigate
whether

we
believe
that

should
be
developed

encouraged
from

however
to
promote
the

it
is
necessary
to
use

we
call

year
he
can
find

is
to
prepare

by
fostering
several
key

recognizing
the
significance
of

they
were
asked
to
design
a

based
on

to
qualitatively
develop
an

1
the

2
which
activities
teachers
preferred
to
implement
and
3
how
they
assessed
student
learning
in
ct
in
their
classroom
preliminary
findings
demonstrate
the
types
of
ct
activities
they
implemented
in
their
classrooms
teachers
also
created
lessons
that
met
their
students
needs
which
further
provides
examples
of
how
ct
is
integrated
within
the
existing
curriculum
surrounding
student
interest
and
culture
many
pl
programs
often
teach
about
ct
concepts
but
do
not
offer
a
chance
to
implement
a
lesson
plan
and
reflect
on
their
experience
this
process
helps
teachers
develop
self-efficacy
for
teaching
ct
in
an
elementary
classroom
and
teachers
reported
that
they
would
continue
to
integrate
ct
within
their
future
instruction
also
this
program
contributes
to
the
reduction
of
the

collaborative_learning
has
proven
to
be
a
productive
approach
across
domains
including
computer
science
especially
for
novices
collaboration
among
learners
with
diverse
experiences
values
and
knowledge
can
be
especially
effective
however
there
is
limited
research
on
how
collaborative
interactions
among
learners
from
different
undergraduate
disciplines
manifest
during
the
learning
of
computational_concepts
this
qualitative
study
investigates
interaction
among
learners
in
small
interdisciplinary
student
groups
in
an
undergraduate
computational

ct
class
in
analyzing
the
social
interactions
of
cohort
members
the
differentiating
overt

activities
dola
framework
developed
by

was
used
as
a
starting
point
several
themes
eg
explain-to-other
self-monitor
connectplan
suggested
by
chi’s
overt

framework
emerged
naturally
in
the
observations
however
several
categories
that
were
not
explicitly
stated
in
the
dola
framework
also
emerged
these
are
asking
a
shallow
question
versus
asking
an
elaborate
question
socializing
being
confused
or
expressing
frustration
self-talk
and
struggle
analysis
of
interactions
between
cohort
members
revealed
that
most
of
the
group
interactions
were
active
in
nature
barriers
to
collaborative_learning
were
accentuated
when
peers
were
novices
students
who
lacked
knowledge
of
computational_concepts
found
it
hard
to
contribute
to
a
discussion
hindering
learning
whereas
students
who
had
better
conceptual
understanding
were
constructive
in
their
interactions
elaborated
on
a
topic
made
connections
with
previous
problems
and
displayed
self-awareness
about
their
understanding
computational
thinking
ct
has
become
an
indispensable
skill
in
the
21st
century
and
has
permeated
into
k-12
education
at
all
levels
the
evaluation
of
ct
has
become
a
crucial
concern
for
educators
and
researchers
currently
while
extensive
research
has
investigated
the
assessment
of
students
ct
conceptual
understanding
the
measurement
of
their
thinking
processes
is
less
involved
the
game-based
assessment
appears
to
address
this
issue
by
analyzing
students
behaviors
and
reactions
during
the
gameplay
process
which
has
become
an
emerging
assessment
tool
in
ct
education
this
drives
the
need
for
a
comprehensive
overview
of
this
field
to
fill
this
gap
this
study
aims
to
conduct
a
systematic
literature
review
on
the
assessment
of
ct
through
games
it
explores
ct
skills
assessed
through
games
focusing
on
target
groups
game
forms
and
benefits
a
total
of
fifteen
studies
were
examined
findings
indicate
that
algorithmic_thinking
problem
decomposition
pattern
recognition
and
abstraction
were
commonly
assessed
in
games
different
ways
for
assessing
ct
skills
in
games
were
identified
involving
progression
level
log
data
and
manual
coding
the
benefits
of
ct
game-based
assessments
were
broadly
reported
such
as
enjoyable

however
limited
has
been
done
in
exploring
the
use
of
digital

for
younger
age
groups
and
the
psychometric
qualities
of

were
hardly
reported

village
is
a
comprehensive

it
provides
more
than
60
sample
functions
that
are
commonly
used
in

and
analyses
automatically
which

are
used
in
a

in
order
to
foster

it
also
provides
automatic

of
computational

concepts
such
as
conditional

and
parallelism
in
order
to
develop
students
programming
skills
the
prerequisite
knowledge
regarding
computer
science
cs
varies
strongly
among
freshmen
at
university
and
it
seems
advisable
to
compensate
for
these
differences
before
the
first
lecture
starts
massive
open
online
courses
moocs
might
represent
a
possible
solution
we
therefore
designed
and
developed
a
mooc
called
“loop
learning
object-oriented
programming”
which
provides
a
gentle
introduction
to
computational
thinking
and
object-oriented
concepts
before
the
programming
part
in
addition
to
the
common
quizzes
we
developed
various
we-based
interactive
exercises
to
enable
the
learners
to
experiment
and
interact
directly
with
the
presented
concepts
furthermore
we
implemented
programming
exercises
with
constructive
feedback
for
the
learners
using
a
web-based
integrated
development
environment
and
additionally
an
automatic
grading
system
the
target
group
of
the
course
are
prospective
students
of
science
or
engineering
that
are
due
to
attend
cs
lessons
in
their
first
terms
the
course
was
conducted
as
a
prototype
with
a
limited
number
of
participants
in
a
concluding
survey
the
participants
submitted
textual
feedback
on
the
course
some
of
them
proposed
specific
improvements
for
the
employed
interactive
exercises
yet
the
overall
feedback
was
encouragingly
positive
in
this
paper
we
describe
the
design
and
the
development
of
the
course
as
well
as
our
initial
results
in
recent
years
several
groups
of
computer
science
educators
have
made
a
sustained
effort
to
capture
the
essence
of
cs
apart
from
programming
three
of
these
approaches
are
mathematical
thinking
abstract
thinking
and
computational
thinking
each
approach
tries
to
clarify
areas
of
cs
that
are
not
directly
tied
to
writing
computer
programs
in
a
separate
line
of
research
the
current
authors
have
been
examining
different
ways
to
teach
mathematics
to
cs
students
we
developed
a
computational
math
scale
that
measures
the
level
of
problem-solving
gestalt
exhibited
by
textbook
authors
in
this
study
we
relate
our
computational
math
framework
to
current
research
on
mathematical
abstract
and
computational
mac
thinking
we
counted
words
used
frequently
in
research
articles
and
compared
them
to
words
that
form
the
computational
math
scale
our
results
suggest
an
overall
mac
thinking
framework
that
integrates
a
wide
range
of
topics
relevant
to
computing
and
programming
video
games
have
grown
in
popularity
since
the
1980s
the
largest
consumers
of
video
games
are
youth
populations
previous
research
has
shown
cognitive
development
and
learning
principles
in
video
games
as
a
result
there
is
an
increasing
interest
in

being
teaching

gamification
is
the
use
of
video
game
elements
in
non-game

in
this

i
proposed
a
design
to
a
study
of
applying
gamification
to
a
computer
programming
software
venvi
in
order
to
promote
motivation
engagement
and
computational

to
address
the
problem
of
underexposure
underrepresentation
and
underproduction
of
diverse
professionals
in
the
field
of

we
target
middle

our
in

examines
how
venvi
can
be
used
to
teach
fundamental
computer
science
concepts
such
as
sequences
loops
variables
conditionals
functions
and
parallel
programming
we
aim
to
reach
younger
students
through
a
fun
and
intuitive
interface
for
choreographing
dance
movements
with
a
virtual
character
our
study
contrasts
the
highly
immersive
and
embodied
virtual
reality
metaphor
of
using
venvi
with
a
non-immersive
desktop
metaphor
additionally
we
examine
the
effects
of
user
attachment
by
comparing
the
learning
results
gained
with
customizable
virtual
characters
in
contrast
with
character
presets
by
analyzing
qualitative
and
quantitative
user
responses
measuring
cognition
presence
usability
and
satisfaction
we
hope
to
find
how
virtual

can
enhance
interest
in
the
field
of
computer

among
middle

because
it
is
written
in
a

use
on

a
study
was
carried
out
with

the
results
show
that
some
students
presented
an
overall
learning
gain
while
others
performed
worse
in
the
posttest
than
in
the
pretest
a
motivational
questionnaire
based
in
the
self-determination
theory
supports
the
idea
that
students
perceived
the
activity
as
difficult
lowering
their
sense
of
autonomy
and
competence
raising
pressure
and
thus
negatively
affecting
motivation
results
by

objective
suggest
that
higher
learnings
were
obtained
for
decision
structures
rather
than
for
cycles
and
arithmetic
operations
with

the
increased
push
for
access
to
computer
science
cs
at
the
k-12
level
has
been
argued
as
a
way
to
broaden
participation
in
computing
at
the
elementary
level
computational
thinking
ct
has
been
used
as
a
framework
for
bringing
cs
ideas
into
the
classroom
and
educating
teachers
about
how
they
can
integrate
ct
into
their
daily
instruction
a
number
of
these
projects
have
made
equity
a
central
goal
of
their
work
by
working
in
schools
with
diverse
racial
linguistic
and
economic
diversity
however
we
know
little
about
whether
and
how
teachers
equitably
engage
students
in
ct
during
their
classroom
instruction-particularly
during
science
and
math
lessons
in
this
paper
we
present
an
approach
to
analyzing
classroom
instructional
videos
using
the
equip
tool
httpswwwequipninja
the
purpose
of
this
tool
is
to
examine
the
quantity
and
quality
of
students
contributions
during
ct-integrated
math
and
science
lessons
and
how
it
differs
based
on
demographic
markers
we
highlight
this
approach
using
classroom
video
observation
from
four
teachers
and
discuss
future
work
in
this
area
in
many
introductory
programming
courses
the
surface
features
of
the
programming
language
can
distract
and
intimidate
students
so
much
that
they
fail
to
concentrate
on
what
is
really
the
ldquobrainyrdquo
task
solving
the
problem
conceptually
to
counter
this
we
devised
a
form
of
structured
pseudocode
designed
to
highlight
and
facilitate
algorithmic
construction
so
that
the
complexities
of
the
programming
language
can
be
deferred
until
proficiency
in
design
has
been
reached
students
taught
with
this
experimental
approach
are
not
introduced
to
the
language
itself
or
the
compiler
until
the
last
few
weeks
of
the
semester
a
controlled
experiment
comparing
this
approach
with
a
traditional
language-based
pedagogy
has
revealed
that
by
the
end
of
the
course
studentspsila
programming
skills
even
on
language-specific
tasks
is
every
bit
as
strong
as
students
taught
traditionally
and
that
their
comfort
level
with
modularity
writing
functions
is
increased
additionally
we
found
that
students
appear
to
strongly
prefer
such
an
approach
citing
mostly
emotive
benefits
and
that
these
effects
may
be
particularly
strong
among
women
artificial

ml
have
heavily
irrupted
in

bringing
new
applications
and
possibilities
while
introducing
some
ethical
problems
governments
and
institutions
around
the
world
are
working
on
the
challenges
posed
by
ai
in
all
aspects
from
economy
to
education
therefore
introducing
ai-related
content
at
school
and
exploring
how
this
kind
of
content
can
be
taught
becomes
mandatory
in
this
paper
we
carry
out
a
bibliographic
revision
of
previous
works
done
on
ml
and
then
describe
an
educational
resource
developed
by
the
institution
of
the
first
two
authors
intef
aimed
to
teach
ml
in
schools
with
scratch
and
machine
learning
for
kids
the
testimonials
of
three
educators
who
have
implemented
their
own
version
of
these
resources
are
depicted
more
efforts
should
be
made
to
introduce
ai-related
content
in
education
several
investigations
state
the
low
participation
of

this
fact
implies
a
lack
of

in
the
solution

occasionally
there

from

attempt
were
used
to
refine
diagnostic

was
then
completed
in

2021
with
191
student
participants
at
three
universities
statistics
show
that
all
diagnostic
questions
had
statistically
significant

c

d
data

and
e
impact
of

this
result
was
unexpected
as
our
goal
was
a
diagnostic
that
could
discriminate
among
the
five
factors
a
small
population
size
caused
by
the
virtual
delivery
of
courses
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
may
be
the
explanation
and
a
third
round
of
validation
in
fall
2021
is
expected
to
result
in
a
larger
population
given
the
return
to
face-to-face
instruction
when
statistical
validation
is
completed
the
diagnostic
will
help
institutions
identify
students
with
strong
entry
level
skills
in
computational
thinking
as
well
as
students
that
require
academic
support
the
diagnostic
will
inform
curriculum
design
by
demonstrating
which
factors
are
more
accessible
to
engineering
students
and
which
factors
need
more
time
and

the
long-term

be

computational

ct
is
an
important
and
essential
skill
for
human
beings
to
master
in
the
21st
century
although
ct
has
received
wide
attention
since
this
concept
was
proposed
the
current
theoretical
models
have
not
well
defined
the
complex
relations
between
ct
and
other
cognitive
abilities
for
young
children
to
provide
insight
into
this
gap
the
current
study
proposed
a
model
in
which
we
hypothesized
that
ct
was
significantly
related
to
arithmetic
fluency
that
is
viewed
as
an
important
domain
of
mathematics
additionally
arithmetic
fluency
was
predicted
to
mediate
the
relations
of
ct
to
other
cognitive
abilities
including
reasoning
and
creativity
this
study
tested
such
direct
and
indirect
relations
in
children
aged
5–6
years
consistent
with
previous
studies
on
older
age
groups
the
results
showed
that
ct
and
arithmetic
fluency
were
significantly
related
to
each
other
and
both
were
significantly
related
to
reasoning
ability
and
creative
thinking
as
well
moreover
this
study
for
the
first
time
indicated
that
arithmetic
fluency
totally
mediated
the
relation
between
ct
and
reasoning
ability
suggesting
that
these
concepts
share
conceptual
commonalities
such
as
the
cognitive
processes
related
to
mathematics
orand
abstraction
in
contrast
arithmetic
fluency
did
not
mediate
the
relation
between
ct
and
creative
thinking
suggesting
that
gaining
ct
skill
may
exert
direct
positive
effect
on
the
development
of
creativity
therefore
despite
the
root
in
computer
science
ct
is
associated
with
many
cognitive
and
learning
abilities
in
other
domains
supporting
the
importance
of
including
ct
into
early
school
education
computational
thinking
ct
is
critical
for

life
ensuring
equitable

depends
on
preparing

and
that
teachers’

moderated
their

early
evidence
suggests
that
robot
programming
offers
an
important
foundation
for
spatial
reasoning
and
computational
thinking
however
researchers
have
debated
how
to
introduce
young
children
to
these
skills
we
explored
how
preschoolers
develop
understanding
of
spatial
concepts
and
computational
thinking
as
the
children
took
turns
navigating
a
path
during
guided
play
with
a

our
analysis
of
the
data
included
a
multimodal
visualization
of
the
exchanges
between
the
teacher
children
and
a
programmable
robotic
device
the
findings
highlight
the
effects
that
arose
from
the
physical-digital
convergence
of
technology
integrated
into
play
including
a
the
robot
evoked
a
chain
of
actions
enacting
pedagogic
forces
that
transformed
childrens
learning
b
children
used
their
own
bodies
as
spatial
referents
co-locating
themselves
in

with
the

c
the
teacher
remained
a
key
actor
providing
verbal
and

scaffolding
to
promote
childrens
understanding

of
spatial

computational_concepts
and
d
talking
with
the
teacher
about
spatial
concepts
combined
with
the
interactions
with
the
robot
enhanced
childrens
acquisition
of

and
computational

play
a
significant
role
in
the
sustained
growth

of
the
global
economy
and
thus
constitute
a
critical
component
in
helping
all
countries
worldwide
to
prosper
in
this
context
computational
thinking
constitutes
an
important
skill
to
have
as
it
enables
workers
to
develop
creative
solutions
to
complex

nonetheless
across
all
economies
worldwide
there
is
a
need
to
have
more
workers
who
are
able
to
think
through

challenges
and

it
is
thus
of

importance
to
integrate
the
teaching
of
computational

in
k-12
education
in
order
to
reduce
the
skills
gap
between

a
pertinent
and
crucial
question
that
arises
is
whether
teachers
have
the
knowledge
and
skills
to
teach
students
how
to
think
computationally
existing
research
shows
that
teacher
education
departments
do
not
currently
have
the
knowledge
to
promote
computational
thinking
in
their
programs
the
present
study
focuses
on
two
aspects
of
computational
thinking
such
as
algorithmic_thinking
and
debugging
skills
with
the
use
of
scaffolded
programming
scripts
in

the
results
show
statistically
significant

however
research
gaps
remain
in

how
srl

our

to
specifically
foster

to
investigate
a

in
a
large-scale

additionally
semi-structured

were
conducted
with
15
students
to
further
probe
insights
quantitative
findings
revealed
a
mutually

relationship
in
the
dynamic

suggesting
that
higher

skills
enhance

abilities
and
vice

complementing
these
results
qualitative
findings
showed
that
integrating

significantly
boosted

these
findings
have
significant

should
consider
implementing

strategies
such
as
proactive

ct
into
elementary
schools
however
few
studies
have
focused
on
teachers’
perceptions
this
study
aims
to
examine
teachers
perceptions
to
bridge
the
gap
between
theory
and
practice
the
study
analysed
teachers’
perceptions
of
integrating
ct
into
school
subjects
through
the
constructionist
approach
using

a
leading
programming
platform
inspired
by
resnicks
lifelong
kindergarten
constructionist
model
over
a
school
year
31
teachers
participated
in
a
professional
development
program
and
applied
this
model
in
their
classrooms
the
teachers
were
interviewed
to
capture
their
perceptions
of
learning
and
teaching
using
a
constructionist
method
the
findings
revealed
that
teachers
with
creative
arts
experience
fully
embraced
the
model
while
others
partially
adopted
it
teachers
recognized
the
benefits
of
constructionist
teaching
in
fostering
creativity
motivation
and
engagement
among
students
however
they
struggled
with
balancing
these
benefits
with
school
demands
and
constraints
challenges
included
managing
time
effectively
within
constraints
of
school
and
ensuring
curriculum
alignment
despite
this
many
teachers
found
that
the
constructionist
approach
positively
impacted
students
learning
engagement
and
personal
development
by
addressing
the
identified
challenges
teacher
education
designers
curriculum
developers
and
schools
can
develop
practices
for
closing
the
gap
between
theory
and
practice
in
the
field
of
education
research
has
consistently
emphasized
mathematical
creative
thinking
as
a
crucial
component
of
21st-century
skills
thus
this
cross-sectional
study
examines
the
predictors
of
such
thinking
by
specifically
focusing
on
the
roles
of
perceived
creativity
creative
self-efficacy
and
computational

structural

modeling
was
employed
demonstrating
satisfactory
construct
validity
and
instrument
reliability
based
on
the
results
there
was
a
positive
association
between
computational
thinking
and
mathematical
creative
thinking
in
addition
perceived
creativity
had
a
positive
impact
on
mathematical
creative
thinking
whereas
creative
self-efficacy
showed
a
negative
association
as
for
the
empirical
model
it
revealed
that
computational
thinking
plays
a
mediating
role
connecting
perceived
creativity
and
creative
self-efficacy
to
mathematical
creative
thinking
the
findings
suggest
that
incorporating
these
skills
and
related
variables
into
the
mathematics
curriculums
in
schools
is
essential
for
preparing
students
for
success
in
the
21st
century
previous
studies
have
explored
the
relationship
between
computational

ct
and
creativity
however
a
consensus
has
yet
to
be
reached
since
both
ct
and
creativity
varied
in
ideation
and
assessment
to
uncover
the
cognitive
mechanism
underlying
the
interplay
between
ct
and
creativity
we
conduct
a
scoping
review
of
26
empirical
studies
published
in
2006–2024
our
findings
suggested
that
the
effects
of
working
memory
varied
in
the
interplay
between
ct
and
creativity
due
to
differences
in
age
range
neural
network
activation
regions
and
measurements
intellectual
abilities
including
algorithmic
fluency
reasoning
ability
and
coding
ability
showed
cognitive
transfer
effect
on
ct
skills
but
not
necessarily
on
creativity
suggesting
that
cognitive
abilities
embracing
more
intelligent
elements
may
contribute
to
the
functional
connectivity
in
ct
neural
networks
but
only
partly
overlapped
with

involved
networks
although
executive
functions
working
memory
cognitive
flexibility
and
inhibitory
control
play
a
crucial
role
in
both
ct
and
creativity
their
contributions
to
the
ct-creativity
interplay
are
still
rarely
studied
future
research
should
explore
the
ct-creativity

provides
strong
evidence
that

promotes
the

recently
the

become
widespread
in
the

there
is
a
consensus
to
develop
students’
ct

through
unplugged

programming
however
the
choice
of

is
arbitrary
and
few

aimed
to
explore
the
differences
between
unplugged
and

programming
in
developing
ct
skills
of
students
in

1-2
students
it
also
explored
the
joint
effects
of
students’
gender
programming
experience
programming
interest
and
programming
confidence
with
different
programming
approaches
on
ct

was
used
to
conduct
10
weeks
of
unplugged
plugged-in

1-2
students
the
results
found
that
unplugged
programming
promoted
ct

more
in
the
early
primary
grades
than
plugged-in

we
found
that
boys
and
students
with
programming
experience
in

group
performed
significantly
better
in
ct

moreover
the
improvement
of

group
was
positively
correlated
with
the
level
of
their

we
also
found
that

however
there
are
few

this

developed
an

about

such
knowledge
and

have
led
to
the
emergence
of

despite
the
importance
of
ai
literacy
in
everyday
life
little
is
known
about
its
determinants
to
better
understand
the
determinants
of
ai

we
attempted
to
build
a
research
model
relying
on
previous
research
and
different
theoretical
frameworks
the
model
incorporated
digital
divide
cognitive
absorption
and
computational

as
a
major
finding
from
the
current
study
computational
thinking
was
found
to
be
a
significant
determinant
of
ai
literacy
which
facilitate
using
recognizing
and
evaluating
ai-based
technologies
moreover
we
found
out
that
individuals
with
physical
access
to
information
and
communication
technologies
icts
are
more
expected
to
use
and
recognize
ai
also
motivation
and
skills
in
using
icts
enable
individuals
to
better
evaluate
the
outcomes
of
ai-based

the
findings
also
showed
that
convenient
access
to
icts
contributes
to
a
deep
involvement
with
ai-based

in
the
use
further
individuals
with
higher
motivation
and
skills
to
use
ai
technologies
are
likely
to
have
a
pleasant
experience
after
using
these
technologies
both
computational
thinking
ct
and
creativity
have
been
recognized
as
key
skills
for
todays
learners
over
the
last
decade
research
of
both
skills
in
a
single
context
has
emerged
in
this
paper
we
present
a
scoping
review
of
62
such
empirical
from
2011
to
2020
our
goal
was
to
have
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
educational
settings
in
which
research
on
both
ct
and
creativity
was
conducted
the
theoretical
foundations
it
has
laid
down
and
the
research
tools
used
our
findings
indicate
a
geographical
bias
dominance
of
the
us
and
prominence
of
developed
european
countries
as
well
as
a
focus
on
secondary_education
and
on
stem-related
disciplines
this
could
be
explained
by
the
current
situation
of
ct
spread
we
also
found
that
when
studying
ct
and
creativity
jointly
it
is
most
common
to
define
ct
in
a
broader
perspective
than
merely
programming
of
computer
science
additionally
while
creativity
is
largely
referred
to
as
product-related
ct
is
barely
referred
to
as
such
taken
together
our
findings
point
out
some
gaps
in
the
current
research
of
ct
and
creativity
and
suggest
how
it
should
be
expended
on
the
fertile
grounds
of
creativity
as
the
latter
crosses
geographical
age
and
subject
borders
doing
so
may
build
a
bridge
between
ct
and
creativity
in
a
way
that
will
benefit
both

ct
is
widely
elaborated
on
as
a
universal
problem-solving
approach
and
a

set
necessary
for
thriving
in
today’s
digitized
societies
scholars
claim
that
ct
for
all
should
be
ensured
from
an
early
age
and
several
studies
develop
and
examine
age-appropriate
technological
tools
as
well
as

danish
kindergartens
the
present
study
conducts
a
socioculturally
informed
analysis
of
video-observed
interactions
between
children
and
educational
robots
the
findings
display
how
children
and
robots
engage
in
interactions
that
transcend
children’s
mastery
of
ct
in
any
narrow
sense
this
is
examined
as

critical
and
informed
decisions
regarding
the
roles
that

in
this
case
educational

can
play
in
their
institutionally

the
paper
concludes
that
children’s
various
enactments
of
ce
deserve
scholarly
and
professional
attention
both
as
an
important
prerequisite
for

as
a
necessary

has
become
a
priority
for
educators
and

recent

critical_thinking
problem-solving
creativity
and
cooperativity
suggests
that
teaching

learning
ct
can
improve
student
academic
performance
in
fact
the
extant
literature
is
quite
sanguine
about
the
topic
of
ct
however
few
studies
have
attempted
to
establish
a
relationship
between
ct
skills
and
academic

in
the
present
cross-sectional
study
we
employ
path
analysis
to
model
the
structural
relationship
between
self-reported
ct
skills
and
academic
performance
of
a
sample
of
81
computer
science
undergraduates
enrolled
at
a
southwestern
american
university
we
found
few
direct
relationships
between
ct
skills
and
academic

we
only
find
a
significant
positive
relationship
between
creativity
and
academic
performance
and
a
significant
negative
relationship
between
cooperativity
and
academic
performance
our
findings
are
surprising
considering
the
abundant
research
promoting
computational
thinking
as
a
key
component
of
21st

skills
the
findings
call
for
further
in-depth
analysis
of
computational

and
the
influence
on

we
discuss
our
results
with
respect
to
recent

contribute
to
the

by
helping
to
clarify
the

these

underline
the
potential
of
utilizing

during
the

process
to
predict
their

especially
in
challenging
environments
like

where
traditional
feature
extraction
and

might
struggle
in
this
paper
we
explore
how
the
theoretical
notion
of
possibility
space
offers
a
way
to
study
how
childrens
computational
thinking
develops
as
a
process
drawing
on
embodied
notions
of
cognition
we
first
examine
the
literature
that
supports
how
childrens
computational
thinking
emerges
as
a
possibility
space
that
involves
conceptualizing
possible
actions
in
a
given
moment
deciding
which
action
to
take
by
anticipating
the
results
of
a
possible
action
and
learning
from
the
actions
that
they
have
taken
we
then
use
a
grounded
approach
to
analyze
the
problem-solving
process
of
two
5th-grade
children
who
engaged
in
an
educational
robotics
activity
over
two
50-minute
class
periods
the
findings
lend
support
for
approaching
childrens
computational
thinking
as
a
cycle
of
action-taking
that
includes
conceptualizing
anticipating
and
taking
action
the
findings
also
support
the
pedagogical
practice
of
having
children
predict
the
results
of
a
computer
program
to
enhance
their
computational
thinking
implications
for
the
way
that
teachers
can
support
children
in
learning
to
conceptualize
what
is
possible
and
take
action
from
it

the
results
showed
that
there
were
significant
bidirectional
predictions
between
students’
stem

and
ct

which
further
confirmed
the
feasibility
and
advantages
of
integrating

for
reducing
the

ece
many

tend
to
link

however
children
are
reluctant

may
be
further
demotivated

as
a
result
a
valid

reliable
performance-based
platform
was
developed
for
measuring
computational

it
has
also
been
concluded
that
the
performance-based
measurement
tool
makes
a
better
measurement
than
the

it
is
emphasized
that
computational

should
be
treated
as
a

not
as

therefore
it
is
believed
that
developing
performance-based
tools
for
evaluating
computational
thinking
skills
and
measuring
them
by
using
multiple
measurement
tools
will
give
more
accurate
results
considering
the
developments
in

it
is
thought
that
the

will
contribute
to
the

this

examined

in
363
first-

we
assessed

differences
in
both
stereotypes
and
motivation
as
well
as
links
between
the
stereotypes
that
individual
children
held
and
their
own
motivation
children
generally
endorsed
stereotypes
about
interest
and
ability
for
computer
coding
that
favored
their
own-gender
group
although
third-grade
girls
reported
gender-egalitarian
beliefs
about
interest
in

there
were
no
gender
differences
in
childrens
motivation
for
computer

in
terms
of
their
own

self-concepts
childrens
stereotypes
about
their
own-gender
group
were
significantly
positively
correlated
with
their
own

these
findings
suggest
that
early
childhood
represents
an
excellent
age
for

to
begin
building
computational

ct
is
an
essential
skill
students
need
if
they
are
to
adapt
to
the
rise
of
digital
society
and
the
evaluation
of
ct
is
crucial
for
enhancing
students’
ct
however
the
current
evaluation
of
ct
is
based
on
a
summative
paradigm
and
ignores
real
ct
performance
during
the
assessment
process
this
study
thus
used
a
multimodal

model
h-mcdm
of
students’
ct
based
on

to
achieve
precise
evaluation
and
explore
the
current

status
of
students’
ct
and
their

the
research
results
indicate
that
1
students’
ct
was
at
a
moderately
high
level
and
indicated
a
good
grasp
of
the
ct
components
of
problem

and
algorithm
design
but
students
had
not

this

showed
that
it

were
applied
to
a

analyses
were
performed
with
ct
performance
as
the

demographic
features
ie
age
gender
and
coding
learning
experience
ie
years
of

that
the
students’
ct
performance
was
significantly
predicted
by
their
attainments
in

and
the
results
remained
significant
after
controlling

the
study
adds
to
the
literature
by
enriching
the
understanding
of

has
practical
implications
for

regarding
the
importance
of

and
the
integration
of

include
the
analysis
and
characterization
of
the
most

techniques
and
their
crossover
with

the
synthesis
between
these
aspects
is
made

dimensions
of
eud
systems
suitable
to
work
scenarios
where
better
roles
and
better

eudability
has
to
do
with

arose
in
how

in
recent

the
development
of
computational

ct
has
become
integral
to
many

worldwide
this
has
been
associated
with
calls
for
computational

be
considered
a
‘21st

competency
valuable
to
all
students
as
a
transferable
process
for
solving

however
while
computational

is
a
focus
of
most
secondary_school

proponents
such

argue
its

this

the
integration
of
computational

ct
into
k-12
education
offers
substantial
potential
to
improve
digital
literacy
and
deepen
students’
understanding
across
various
subject
areas
by
embedding
computational
procedures
and
solution-oriented
approaches
into
traditional
curricula
students
can
develop
essential
skills
that
are
critical
for
thriving
in
an
increasingly
digital
world
however
the
effective
integration
of
ct
into
subject-specific
learning
poses
challenges
for
educators
largely
due
to
a
lack
of
training
and
experience
in
implementing
interdisciplinary
instructional
strategies
this
study
explores
the
impact
of
integrating
ct
into
k-12
education
through
diverse
instructional
approaches
including
modelling
storytelling
and
unplugged_activities
the
research
examines
how
students
subject
knowledge
ct
concepts
and
practices
evolved
under
each
ct
integration
practice
as
well
as
their
acceptance
toward
ct
integrated
lessons
the
study
was
conducted
in
different
subjects
including
language
arts
biology
and
physics
and
at
different
grade
levels
the
technology
acceptance
model
was
used
as
a
theoretical
framework
to
understand
students
adoption
towards
the
different
integration
practices
the
study
revealed
that
different
ct
integration
practices
yield
varying
impacts
on
students
attitudes
particularly
in
relation
to
their
prior
programming
experiences
namely
primary_school
students
with
prior
programming
experience
display
a
higher
behavioural
intention
due
to
a
lack
of
early
biases
toward
programming
conversely
secondary_school
students
less
familiar
with
interdisciplinary
approaches
initially
show
less
enthusiasm
for
future
engagement
these
insights
underscore
the
need
for
tailored
instructional
strategies
that
consider
students
prior
experiences
and
the
broader
goal
of
preparing
them
to
contribute
to
a
technologically
driven
society
as
we
begin
to
identify
essential
skills
for
the
future
there
has
been
an
increased
focus
on
how
to
define
and
implement
computational
thinking
within
education
however
the
question
of
how
to
engage
children
with
coding
activities
within
the
context
and
limitations
of
the
curriculum
remains
relatively
explored
in
our
study
a
human-centered
design
approach
was
followed
to
guide
a
small
group
of
children
through
the
co-design
implementation
and
evaluation
of
a
board
game
the
board
game
had
two
versions
an
offline
version
involving
a
robotic
agent
and
an
online
version
with
its
digital
equivalent
a
mixed-method
approach
was
used
to
understand
and
compare
levels
of
engagement
usability
and
collaboration
in
both
versions
of
the
game
the
tangible
aspect
of
working
with
a
robotic
agent
in
the
offline
version
led
to
greater
levels
of
motivation
and
involvement
with
the
game
mechanics
tangible
robotics
games
tend
to
be
more
approachable
for
children
our
study
shows
that
using
such
games
by
connecting
the
mathematics
curriculum
with
coding
problems
can
successfully
engage
participants
in
collaborative
computational
thinking
activities
we
contribute
to
the
field
by
providing
human-centered
guidance
for
the
creation
of
educational
tools
to
develop
computational
thinking
such
guidance
is
not
only
applicable
in
technologically
rich
environments
it
can
also
be
applied
in
educational
communities
with
limited
access
to
technology
computational
thinking
ct
has
been
relevant
in
teaching
stem
courses
and
educators
are
incorporating
both
plugged
and
unplugged
ct
activities
in
their
modules
to
prepare
new
entrants
for
advanced
knowledge
however
additional
empirical
data
are
needed
to
understand
how
an
unplugged_activities
approach
can
lead
to
an
improved
understanding
of
ct
concepts
therefore
this
study
investigates
the
impact
of
unplugged_activities
on
novice
students
ct
skills
and
unravels
the
characteristics
of
students
ct
competency
from
performing
unplugged_activities
the
experimental
aspect
of
this
study
was
conducted
with
a
cohort
of
210
students
participating
in
an
introductory
programming
course
at
a
university
in
nigeria
a
mixed-method
research
approach
and
a
quasi-experimental

were
applied
in
this
study
to
understand
how
the
unplugged
approach
in
teaching
ct
could
help
students
improve
their
ct

a
paired-sample
t-test
of

score
for
each
ct

showed
a
significant
increase
in
the

furthermore
latent
dirichlet

lda
was
used
for
topic

topic
modeling
allows
for
more
insights
into

and
7241
of

who
applied
ct
concepts
of

were
able
to
solve
the

correctly
indeed
ct
unplugged_activities
significantly
increased
the
number
of
students
who
gained
ct
competency
in
addition
this
study
provides
recommendation
for
computer

educators
and
highlight
future
direction
computational
thinking
is
a
fundamental
competence
that
is
being
introduced
in
k-12
and
succeeding
curricula
worldwide
despite
this
huge
effort
many
computational
thinking
models
in
the
literature
do
not
explicitly
take
into
consideration
the
pupils’
age
and
the
developmental
nature
of
computational
thinking
skills
furthermore
many
existing
computational
thinking
models
are
focused
on
the
internal
thinking
processes
of
the
individuals
failing
to
explicitly
consider
the
situated
nature
in
terms
of
social
context
and
artefactual
environment
that
usually
characterise
tasks
that
require
computational
thinking
to
be
solved
in
this
paper
we
present
a
framework
for
the
design
realisation
analysis
and
assessment
of
computational
thinking
activities
called
ct-cube
the
ct-cube
allows
to
extend
existing
computational
thinking
models
to
consider
the
life-long
development
of
computational
thinking
skills
in
individuals
from
childhood
to
adult
age
and
to
take
into
consideration
the
situated
nature
of
computational
thinking
activities
we
use
the
ct-cube
to
design
an
unplugged
task
called
cross
array
task
cat
allowing
to
assess
the
algorithmic
skills
of
k-12
pupils
and
we
show
how
the
ct-cube
can
be
used
in
this
case
to
illustrate
the
development
of
this
competence
along
the
entire
compulsory
school
path
considering
a

were
obtained
based
on
the

show
that
the

significantly
improved

further
enriches
the

continues
to
emerge
as
key
global
concerns
green

systems
are
becoming
increasingly
relevant
in
the

in
this

leed
leadership
in

and
environmental
design
is
considered
one
of
the
most
widely
recognized
environmental
assessment
methods
used
globally
in
the
construction
industry
today
however
due
to
the
high
level
of
complexity
of
the
leed
system
the
tools
usually
used
to
verify
the
achievement
of
the

lack
of
“design

and
hardly
communicate
effectively
with
the
conventional

used
by

this
makes
difficult
to
fully
take
into
account
especially
at
the
early
design
stage
the
many
interconnected
aspects
that
contribute
to
the
green
certification
with
consequent
issues
often
arising
in
the

phases
resulting
in

the
application
of
innovative
problem-solving
methods
such
as
computational

together
with
coding
techniques
represents
an
effective
way
to
deal
with
this

this
kind
of

in

allows
the

to
be
digitally
parametrised
and
flexibly
incorporated
into
a

useful
to
improve

the
aim
of
this

is
to
illustrate
a
methodology
through
which
by
merging
computational

is
possible
to
keep

in
the

all
the

be
understood
as
a
proxy
for
the
broader
questions
about

computational

ct
the
conceptual
foundations
required
for
solving
complex
problems
effectively
and
efficiently
is
an
imperative
skill
for
todays
learners
across
disciplines
and
across
ages
as
for
its
importance
in
the
wide
network
of
digital
literacies
ct
has
been
implemented
in
various
educational
contexts
however
mostly
via
digital
artifacts
specifically
in
programming-related
activities
this
approach
does
not
fulfill
the
potential
of
such
integration
for
promoting
learning
in
this
paper
we
argue
that
digital
literacies
should
not
be
bound
to
the
digital
realm
and
present
a
novel
approach
to
fully
integrate
ct
into
learning
and
teaching
by
the
development
of
ct-infused
“unplugged”
pedagogical
tools
that
are
fully
embedded
in
the
subject
matter
we
demonstrate
the
advantages
to
student
learning
of
these
tools
in
two
case
studies
from
k-12
mathematics
education
1
an
assistive
tool
for
function
investigation
in
high-school
calculus
–
in
this
case
we
point
out
to
how
ct
skills
that
were
implemented
in
the
tool
promoted
students
problem_solving
2
a
teaching
unit
for
pattern
sequences
in
elementary_school
–
in
this
case
we
show
how
students
in
the
ct
research
group
outperformed
students
in
the
other
groups
and
how
they
implemented
ct
to
solve
pattern
sequence
problems
effectively
and
efficiently
we
highlight
that
besides
enhancing
learning
this
approach
can
help
address
the
important
issue
of
equity
in
education
and
suggest
ways
to
promote
it
via
dedicated
professional
development
creativity
and
computational
thinking
ct
have
been
pointed
out
as
two
important
skills
that
would
promote
students
in
the
digital
age
as
contributing
members
of
society
therefore
these
two
constructs
have
been
extensively
researched
in
recent
years
but
the
associations
between
them
are
yet
to
be
fully
understood
this
study
takes
another
step
towards
bridging
this
gap
by
examining
the
association
between
ct
and
three
types
of
creativity
ie
figural
creative
thinking
verbal
creative
thinking
and
computational
creativity
data
was
collected
from
119
ninth-grade
students
14–15
years

took
two
commonly
used

also
used
kodetu—an
online

environment
for
ct—and
we
used
the
system
log

to
measure
their
ct
acquirement
and
their
computational
creativity
findings
suggest
some
nuanced
associations
between
the
four
sets
of
variables
specifically
we
point
out
the
limited
associations
between
verbal
and
figural
creativities
some
of
which
are
negative
also
we
found
that
the
associations
between
creative
thinking
and
ct
as
well
as
between
creative

and
computational
creativity
differ
by

furthermore
studies
on
courses
or
training
offered
to
preschool
teachers
related
to
the
teaching
of
ct
were
also
considered
from
the
selected

the
following
information
was
collected

ct

approaches
tools
used
to
teach

and
how
they
are
classified
according
to
their
physical
characteristics
and
finally
participants
and
individuals
responsible
for
the
research
the
results
suggest
an
increase
in
the
number
of
publications
in
recent
years
revealing
the
interest
of
researchers
in
the
topic
furthermore
we
observed
a
trend
towards
the
use
of
physical
artifacts
and
the
use
of
the
disconnected
computing
approach
to
teaching
ct
skills
to
preschool
children
the
results
also
exposed
that
preschool
teachers
have
little
autonomy
in
implementing
ct
teaching
activities
because
those
are
mostly
implemented
by
computer
professionals
researchers
teachers
etc
this
is
because
preschool
teachers
are
still
discouraged
from
teaching
computer
and
technology-related
content
to
children
considering
them
complex
and
disconnected
from
basic
curricula
however
when
teachers
are
trained
to
teach
ct
they
become
interested
in
the
content
and
become
more
active
during
the
teaching
process
we
argue
for
integrating
ct-related
content
into
education
curricula
and
supporting
preschool
teachers
to
implement
it
autonomously
in
their
classrooms
this
paper
deals
within
a
context
where
technology
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
education
in
this
sense
it
is
essential
to
highlight
the
emergence
of
new
competencies
and
skills
in
education
due
to
technological
advancements
legislative
frameworks
have
been
developed
to
incorporate
digital
literacy
access
to
robotics
and
computational
thinking
between
others
hence
this
review
and
meta-analysis
aim
at
identifying
the
influence
of
robotics
activities
on
computational
thinking
through
a
prisma-guided
review
the
findings
reveal
that
interventions
conducted
in
early_childhood_education
significantly
impact
computational
thinking
results
also
showcase
that
despite
perceived
barriers
related
to
technology
accessibility
the
presence
of
legislation
and
contexts
prioritizing
these
competencies
is
more
relevant
than
the
digital
access
gap
since
computational
thinking
is
a
high-level
cognitive
skill
and
its
conceptual
framework
has
not
yet
been
clarified
the
assessment
of
this
skill
is
problematic
while
there
is
no
consensus
in
the
literature
about
the
components
of
computational
thinking
the
abstraction
component
is
located
at
a
point
where
opinions
intersect
in
addition
it
is
predicted
that
computer
science
unplugged_activities
will
improve
computational
thinking
and
there
is
limited
research
examining
this
effect
as
a
result
this
research
aims
to
demonstrate
the
alleged
effects
of
computer
science
unplugged_activities
on
abstraction
skill
which
is
considered
the
critical
component
of
computational
thinking
the
study
which
was
planned
with
a
mixed_methods
research
design
lasted
8
weeks
quantitative
data
were
obtained
from
the
abstraction
skill
test
developed
by
the
researchers
while
qualitative
data
were
obtained
from
observations
and
task-
based
interviews
after
each
activity
quantitative
findings
showed
that
computer
science
unplugged_activities
significantly
improve
abstraction
skills
and
thus
computational
thinking
qualitative
findings
not
only
revealed
that
developments
in
the
six
abstracting
steps
caused
this
significant
difference
but
also
identified
abstracting
steps
where
the
effect
of
each
activity
was
limited
suggestions
for
organizing
activities
to
improve
these
steps
are
given
finally
suggestions
are
presented
for
the
conceptual
framework
of
computational
thinking
based
on
abstraction
the
healthy
development
of
cognitive
functions
including
executive
functions
has
been
shown
to
depend
mainly
on
the
experiences
and
learning
opportunities
of
people
especially
during
childhood
over
the
past
few
years
researchers
have
been
studying
the
impacts
of
diverse
types
of
interventions
on
children’s
cognitive
development
in
which
computational
thinking
programs
are
a
recent
field
this
pilot
study
evaluated
the
effect
of
computational
thinking
training
based
on
the
“programming
for
children”
program
on
the
executive
functions
of
children
aged
10
and
11
years
working
memory

the
results
showed
that
children
in
the
experimental
group
improved
on
tests
of
visuospatial
working
memory
cognitive
inhibition
and
sequential
planning
compared
with
the
control
group
however
tests
of
verbal
working
memory
memory
strategy
and
visual
spatial
planning
did
not
show
any
observed
changes
although
this
was
an
exploratory
study
and
its
findings
should
be
interpreted
cautiously
due
to
the
small
sample
size
the
findings
support
the
relevance
and
feasibility
of
conducting
similar
larger
studies
with
larger
samples
computational
thinking
has
been
promoted
as
an
impactful
21st-century
skillset
that
can
be
transferred
to
many
other
disciplines
and
problem
scenarios
with
the
proliferation
of
age-appropriate
coding
platforms
for
young
children
computational
thinking
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
early
childhood
settings
however
there
is
a
lack
of
research
on
introducing
coding
and
computational
thinking
to
teacher
training
in
early_childhood_education
to
empower
early
childhood
teachers
in
the
digital
society
this
study
introduced
17
early
childhood
teachers
to
robot
programming
and
computational
thinking
through
the
‘ct4ece’
professional
development
program
which
includes
three
phases

and
reflect
improve
results
of
pre-
and
post-intervention
surveys
revealed
that
the
ct4ece
program
significantly
enhanced
teachers
robotics
and
pedagogical
knowledge
as
well
as
their
attitudes
towards
computational
thinking
especially
their
interest
in
and
their
view
of
using
computational
thinking
in
classroom
practice
post-intervention
interviews
indicated
that
participation
in
ct4ece
helped
educators
gain
a
basic
understanding
of
both
coding
robots
and
computational
thinking
suitable
for
young
children
due
to
a
structured
change

this
study
establishes
a
strong
foundation
for
enhancing
and
expanding
the
ct4ece
program
ultimately
equipping
teachers
and
children
with
the
necessary
skillsets
to
thrive
in
the

was
used
activities
based

post-test
scores
for

showed
a
statistically
significant
difference
in

of
the
experimental

it
was
concluded
that
the
uct-stem
approach
was
more
effective
in
developing
the
pre-service
teachers’
ct
skills
than
the
stem
approach
the
current
study
presents
an
important
finding
to
the
literature
in
terms
of
the
developed
stem
and
uct-stem
contents
and
how
these
contents
improve
pre-service
teachers’
ct
skills
the
stem
and
uct-stem
content
provides
significant
information
in
terms
of
teacher
practices
at
the
same
time
this
study
offers
important
implications
for
program
developers
and
policy-makers
to
integrate
these
innovative
educational
approaches
into
both
early_childhood_education
and
teacher
education
programs
the
integration
of
computational
thinking
ct
to
enhance
creativity
in
design
students
has
often
been
underexplored
in
design
education
while
design
thinking
has
traditionally
been
the
cornerstone
of
university
design
pedagogy
and
remains
essential
the
increasing
role
of
digital
tools
and
artificial
intelligence
in
modern
design
practices
presents
new
opportunities
for
innovation
by
introducing
ct
alongside
design
thinking
students
can
expand
their
creative
toolkit
and
engage
with
emerging
technologies
more
effectively
although
many
design
students
may
have
limited
experience
with
programming
incorporating
accessible
no-code
tools
can
help
them
confidently
embrace
computational
methods
unlocking
new
pathways
for
creative
exploration
and
innovation
this
study
proposes
an
alternative
approach
to
improve
the
motivation
of
design
students
by
introducing
machine
learning
tools
into
product
design
processes
we
developed
an
experimental
pedagogy
in
which

analysis
weka
a
machine
learning
tool
for
three
hours
of

work
a
week
for
a
total
of
eight
weeks
our
covariate
analysis
of
data
collected
in
the
pretest
and
posttest
shows
that
the
general
learning
motivations
in
the
group
using
weka
are
significantly
higher
than
those
in
the
group
without
weka
however
no
significant
differences
were
found
between
the
two
groups
in
terms
of
learning
strategies
collaboration
or
critical_thinking
students
using
weka
spent
more
time
focusing
on
model
training
and
tended
to
improve
their
algorithmic_thinking
and
the
introduction
of
weka
appeared
to
enhance
their
motivation
to
learn
on
the
other
hand
these
students
might
have
been
focusing
on
working
individually
at
their
computers
potentially
neglecting
communication
and
collaboration
the
findings
suggest
that
teaching
machine
learning
applications
without
requiring
coding
has
the
potential
to
boost
design
students
motivation
to
engage
with
ct
skills
though
care
must
be
taken
to
maintain
collaborative
practices
there
is
increasing
effort
to
integrate
computational
thinking
ct
curricula
across
all
education
levels
therefore
research
on
ct
assessment
has
lately
progressed
towards
developing
and
validating
reliable
ct
assessment
tools
which
are
crucial
for
evaluating
students
potential
learning
progress
and
thus
the
effectiveness
of
suggested
curricular
programs
several
ct
assessment
tools
were
developed
for
elementary
high-school
and
university
students
over
the
last
years
moreover
associations
between
ct
scores
and
other
cognitive
abilities
were
unraveled
however
studies
on
the
topic
in
primary_school
level
are
scarce
like
the
general
concept
of
intelligence
ct
remains
broadly
defined
as
the
ability
to
combine
algorithmic
operations
to
form
complex
solutions
in
order
to
solve
problems
effectively
utilizing
concepts
of
computer
science
with
or
without
the
use
of
computers
in
this
study
we
aimed
at
specifying
a
cognitive
definition
of
ct
focusing
on
the
under-investigated
population
of
primary_school
children
since
validated
assessment
tools
for
this
age
group
were
not
available
we
adapted
a
validated
ct
test
which
was
initially
designed
for
middle
school
students
in
our
study
participated
192
third
and
fourth
graders
the
analyses
revealed
promising
results
on
the
reliability
of
the
adapted
ct
assessment
for
primary_school
students
moreover
findings
indicated
cts
positive
associations
with
i
complex
numerical
abilities
ii
verbal
reasoning
abilities
and
iii
non-verbal
visuospatial
abilities
our
results
indicate
similarities
but
also
differences
in
associations
of
ct
with
other
cognitive
abilities
in
primary_school
children
compared
to
other
age
groups
in
summary
i
numerical
abilities
seem
to
associate
with
ct
at
the
primary_school
level
whereas
this
seems
not
the
case
later
on
in
education
ii
verbal
abilities
seem
to
associate
with
ct
both
along
primary
and
secondary_education
levels
and
iii
non-verbal
reasoning
abilities
seem
to
associate
with
ct
from
primary_education
level
to
the
university
level
and
beyond
these
differences
imply
that
several
basic
cognitive
abilities
support
ct
abilities
and
ct
development
differentially
across
ages
the
concept
of
artificial

evolves
into
one
of

that
provide

to
better
themselves
in
a

of
areas
unlike
the
previous

which
are
limited
to

ai
has
proposed
a
unique

laboratory
by
enabling

to
explore
an

that
functions
as

however
the
extent
of
the
implications
of
ai

is

to
be
explored
motivated
to
fill
the
literature
gap
and
to
consider
the
emerging

this
paper
aims
to
analyze
the
possible
intertwined
relationship
between
students’
intrinsic
motivation
for
learning
artificial
intelligence
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
the
relationship
between
students’
computational

and
understanding
of

concepts
and
the
underlying
dynamic
relation
if

building
efforts
to
investigate
the
mentioned
relationships
the
present
empirical

based
upon

students
in
the
institute
for
educational

and
the
school
of
naval

during
the
first
quarter
of
2022
findings
show
that
intrinsic
motivation
mediates
the
relationship
between
perceived
artificial
intelligence
learning
and
computational
thinking
also
the
research
indicates
that
intrinsic
motivation
has
a
significant
relationship
with
computational
thinking
and
perceived
artificial

learning
computational
thinking
is
widely
recognized
as
an
essential
skill
for
adapting
to
the
current
era
with
programming
learning
being
the
most
effective
means
to
develop
it
it
is
recommended
that
computational
thinking
and
learning
programming
be
introduced
as
early
as
elementary_school
however
elementary_school
students
often
possess
limited
prior
knowledge
of
programming
posing
challenges
in
their
learning
process
the
graphic
organizers
gos
may
serve
as
a
bridge
between
students’
existing
knowledge
and
new
learning
facilitating
a
deeper
processing
of
the
overall
information
and
thereby
enhancing
the
learning
process
this
can
be
particularly
advantageous
for
early-stage
learners
when
grappling
with
difficult
subjects
consequently
this
study
employed
gos
to
assist
elementary_school
students
in
their
computational
thinking
and
programming
learning
employing
a
quasi-experiment
design
to
evaluate
their
effectiveness
the
results
showed
that
although
all
students
demonstrated
awareness
of
applying
computational
thinking
to
solve
problems
those
exposed
to
go-based
instruction
exhibited
higher
levels
of
computational

programming
skills
and
flow

computational

is
a
critical
cognitive
tool
for
students
to
overcome
challenges
in
this
technological

insights
of

were
discussed
in
bringing
ct

to

engagement
is
critical
to
computational

and
programming
education
however
as
multi-dimensional
variables
when
analyzing
how
different
aspects
of
engagement
in
computational
thinking
tasks
influence
skills
development
it
becomes
crucial
to
discern
precisely
which
engagement
components
intersect
with
the
progression
of
computational
thinking
skills
this
discernment
is
pivotal
because
engagement
can
vary
based
on
the
task
nature
the
context
and
the
individuals
preferences
therefore
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
explore
the
gender
differences
in
engagement
and
computational
thinking
skills
and
the
predictive
relationships
among
these
sub-dimensions
for
boys
and
girls
in
an
unplugged
environment
in
this
study
a
quasi-experiment
for
90
sixth-grade
students
from
a
north
chinese
primary_school
was
performed
by
partial
least
squares–structural
equation
modeling
students’
models
of
computational
thinking
skills
and
engagement
were
analyzed
and
comparisons
of
boys
and
girls
were
made
by
analysis
of
covariance
statistics
results
indicated
that
compared
with
boys
girls
reported
higher
computational
thinking
performance
and
more
engagement
in
unplugged
contexts
furthermore
girls’
computational
thinking
skills
were
only
predicted
by
their
cognitive
engagement
whereas
boys’
computational
thinking
skills
were
predicted
by
their
behavioral
emotional
and
cognitive
engagement
teachers
can
adopt
these
findings
to
design
computational
thinking
teaching
interventions
that
combine
the
advantages
of
unplugged
activity
and
focus
on
the
engagement
of
boys
and
girls
in
this
work
we
argue
for
expanding
the
scope
of
k-12
computational
thinking
ct
integration
contexts
to
include
everyday
scenarios
involving
moral
reasoning
epistemic
overlap
between
computational
thinking
practices
and
moral
reasoning
suggest
that
these
contexts
are
potentially
rich
sites
to
see
“seeds
of
ct”
in
childrens
reasoning
and
can
provide
rich
educational
pathways
for
children
into
ct
taking
a
case-study
approach
we
examine
the
reasoning
of
a
second-grader
ollie
on
a
task
involving
fair
allocation
of
resources
to
victims
of
a
natural
disaster
our
analysis
finds
that
ollies
reasoning
was
rich
with
seeds
of
ct
eg
problem
formulation
abstraction
complex-systems
thinking
and
that
empathy
served
as
an
important
supporting
role
to
the
ct
this
work
has
implications
for
curricular
design
suggesting
that
fairness
and
resource
allocation
scenarios
with
built-in
opportunities
for
empathy
might
provide
rich
sandboxes
for
ct
integration
under
a
project-based_learning
environment
this
effort
created
a

student
motivation
to
pursue
stem
disciplines
a
considerable
part
of
the
behavior
in
smart
environments
relies
on
event-driven
and
rule
specification
rules
are
the
mechanism
most
often
used
to
enable
user
customization
of
the
environment
however
the
expressiveness
of
the
rules
available
to
users
in
editing
and
other
tools
is
usually
either
limited
or
the
available
rule
editing
interfaces
are
not
designed
for
end-users
with
low
skills
in
programming
this
means
we
have
to
look
for
interaction
techniques
and
new
ways
to
define
user
customization
rules
this
paper
describes
a
generic
and
flexible
meta-model
to
support
expressive
rules
enhanced
with
data
flow
expressions
that
will
graphically
support
the
definition
of
rules
without
writing
code
an
empirical
study
was
conducted
on
the
ease
of
understanding
of
the
visual
data
flow
expressions
which
are
the
key
elements
in
our
rule
proposal
the
visual
dataflow
language
was
compared
to
its
corresponding
textual
version
in
terms
of
comprehension
and
ease
of
learning
by
teenagers
in
exercises
involving
calculations
modifications
writing
and
detecting
equivalences
in
expressions
in
both
languages
although
the
subjects
had
some
previous
experience
in
editing
mathematical
expressions
on
spreadsheets
the
study
found
their
performance
with
visual
dataflows
to
be
significantly
better
in
calculation
and
modification
exercises
this
makes
our
dataflow
approach
a
promising
mechanism
for
expressing
user-customized
reactive
behavior
in
ambient
intelligence
ami
environments
the
performance
of
the
rule
matching
processor
was
validated
by
means
of
two
stress
tests
to
ensure
that
the
meta-model
approach
adopted
would
be
able
to
scale
up
with
the
number
of
types
and
instances
in

in
this
chapter
we
will
outline
the
critical
steps
necessary
to
building
an
authentic
space-based
stem

and
emphasize
the
beneficial
preparation
these
experiences
will
provide
in
shaping
and
adding
needed

for

as
they
move
forward
in

we
will
explain

and
emphasize
the
importance
of

finally
we
will
show
the
need
to
create
or
identify
“next

for

to
keep

over
the

the
formal
study
of
culture
has
grown
into
one
of
the
most
exciting
systematic
and
dynamic
sub-fields
in
sociology
in
this
essay
we
take
stock
of
recent
developments
in
this
field
we
highlight
four
emerging
themes
1
the
maturation
of
the
field
that
has
occurred
over
the
last
two
decades
2
the
rise
and
formalization
of
the
“cultural
matrix”
approach
to
studying
culture
3
the
development
of
various
efforts
to
advance
a
more
formal
theory
of
culture
and
4
the
proliferation
of
big
data
and
the
development
of
new
kinds
of
quantitative
and
computational
approaches
to
the
study
of
culture
including
the
emergence
of
a
new
area
focused
on
“computational
hermeneutics”
we
conclude
by
discussing
future
opportunities
challenges
and
questions
in
formalizing
culture
a
limited
body
of
work
has
examined
the
nature
and
scope
of
young
children’s
science-related
activities
outside
of
the
school
context
and
thus
there
is
little
understanding
or
consensus
regarding
what
comprises
the
home
science
environment
hse
eg
interactions
activities
resources
and
how
specific
factors
of
the
hse
relate
to
children’s
science
performance
the
two
primary
goals
of
this
study
were
to
a
examine
the
factor
structure
of
a
parent-report
measure
of
home
science
interactions
and
b
evaluate
how
these
factors
relate
to
the
science
core
knowledge
of
young
children
from
families
with
low
incomes
a
total
of
125
families
with
children
aged
3
to
5
years
52
girls
participated
in
the
study
children
were
assessed
on
a
measure
of
science
core
knowledge
and
parents
completed
a
brief
questionnaire
on
their
home
science
interactions
that
included
questions
pertaining
to
both
home
science
disciplinary
core
idea
dci
engagement
and
home
science
and
engineering
practice
sep
engagement
findings
revealed
that
although
separating
home
science
interactions
into
distinct
dci
and
sep
factors
represented
the
data
well
the
best
overall
representation
of
home
science
interactions
was
a
one-factor
model
that
included
only
home
dci
engagement
items
in
addition
home
dci
engagement
was
significantly
predictive
of
children’s
science
core
knowledge
over
and
above
a
large
group
of
covariates
including
children’s
age
raceethnicity
sex
and
performance
on
math
executive
function
and
vocabulary
tasks
as
well
as
their
parents’
education
there
is
growing
interest
in
teaching
computer
science
and
programming
skills
in
schools
here
we
investigated
the
efficacy
of
peer
tutoring
which
is
known
to
be
a
useful
educational
resource
in
other
domains
but
never
before
has
been
examined
in
such
a
core
aspect
of
applied
logical_thinking
in
children
we
compared
a
how
children
n
42
age
range
7
years
1
month
to
8
years
4
months
learn
computer
programming
from
an
adult
versus
learning
from
a
peer
and
b
the
effect
of
teaching
a
peer
versus
simply
revising
what
has
been
learned
our
results
indicate
that
children
taught
by
a
peer
showed
comparable
overall
performance—a
combination
of
accuracy
and
response
times—to
their
classmates
taught
by
an
adult
however
there
was
a
speed–accuracy
trade-off
and
peer-taught
children
showed
more
exploratory
behavior
with
shorter
response
times
at
the
expense
of
lower
accuracy
in
contrast
no
tutor
effects
ie
resulting
from
teaching
a
peer
were
found
thus
our
results
provide
empirical
evidence
in
support
of
peer
tutoring
as
a
way
to
help
teach
computer
programming
to
children
this
could
contribute
to
the
promotion
of
a
widespread
understanding
of
how
computers
operate
and
how
to
shape
them
which
is
essential
to
our
values
of
democracy
plurality
and
freedom
the
application
of
artificial

ai
technology
in

is
increasingly
recognized
as
a
key
driver
of
educational
innovation
while
extensive
literature
exists
on
the

less
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
the
critical

this

specifically
65
of

this
review
highlights
a
gap
in
research
addressing
the
development
needs
of
teachers
as
they
integrate
ai
technologies
into
their

it
emphasizes
the
need
for
future
research
to
focus
more
on
the
potential
of
ai
in

and
to
investigate
how
ai
technologies
can
be
applied
in
education
from
both
the
perspectives
of
student
learning
and

instruction
furthermore
research
on

should
prioritize
addressing
technological
and
ethical
challenges
to
ensure
the
responsible
and
effective
integration
of
ai
in

in
recent
years
we
have
seen
many
examples
of
software
products
unintentionally
causing
demonstrable
harm
many
guidelines
for
ethical

have
been
developed
in
response
dominant
approaches
typically
attribute
liability
and
blame
to
individual

rather
than
understanding
how
the
working
practices
norms
and
cultural
understandings
in
the
software
industry
contribute
to
such
outcomes
in
this
paper
we
propose
an
understanding
of
responsibility
that
is
infrastructural
relational
and
cultural
thus
providing
a
foundation
to
better
enable
responsible
software
engineering
into

our
approach
draws
on

concept
of

by
bringing
these
theories
together
we
introduce
a
concept
called
infrastructural

which
offers
a
new
way
for
software
engineers
to
consider
their
opportunities
for
responsible
action
with
respect
to
society
and
the

we
illustrate
the
utility
of
this
approach
by
applying
it
to
an
open-source
software
communities’
development
of
deepfake
technology
to
find
key

points
of

that
are
relevant
to
both

more
broadly
in
this

our
primary

is
to
introduce
the

and
iv
profiling
the

is
rooted
in
the

which
seeks
to
uncover

additionally
the
construction
of
social

is
guided
by
the
organizational
network
analysis
model
a
concept
grounded
in
social
networks
designed
to
simplify
the
initiation
of
new

the
viso
approach
stands
out
through
its
amalgamation
of
dynamic
trust
mechanisms
object
virtualization
real-time
interaction
monitoring
and
the
highlighting
of
the
most
active

these
characteristics
collectively
contribute
to
its
effectiveness
in
managing
relationships
within
the
social
iot
while
simultaneously
addressing
challenges
posed
by
alternative
models
preliminary
results
in
a

substantiate
the
model’s
capability
to
categorize

underscors
the
need
for

bridges
this

by
introducing
a

by
a

for
designing

we
demonstrate
the

furthermore
the

however
the

regarding
the
relationship
between
students’

these

were
constrained
by
their
reliance
on

as
a
means
of
collecting
and

the
findings
reveal
that
higher-order

were
mostly
adopted
by
high-performing

strategy
such
as

and
help-seeking
were
mostly
employed
by
low-performing

this
study
not
only
demonstrates
the
design
of
combining
eye-tracking
and
retrospective

data
to
explore
students’
use
of

but
also
provides
evidence
to
support
the
notion
that

investigated
the
roles
of

is
higher
than
those
who
did
not
receive

it
proves
that
learning
using

is
effective
in
increasing
the
ability
to
think
geometry
then
the
results
of
observations
made
during

skills
have
been
gaining
an
enormous
amount
of
attention
from
researchers
and
practitioners
given
numerous
studies
support
the
positive
effects
of
games
on

a
growing
number
of
researchers
are
committed
to
developing

however
little
is
known
regarding
how

may
influence
student
acquisition
of
21st

skills
this
paper
examines
the
most
recent
literature
in
regard
to
game-based_learning
and
identified
29
studies
which
targeted
21st

together
with
the

the

suggest
that

also
provides

in
issues
related

the
digitalization
of

he
institutions
and
relevant

have
attracted
the
attention
of
many
educational
stakeholders
ict
has
become
a
subject
of
high
importance
in
every
context
particularly
in
the
workplace
thus
a
principal
goal
for
universities
and
schools
is
to
prepare
future
professionals
capable
of
dealing
with
problems
and
searching
for
effective
solutions
by
their
digital
competence
as
a
key
skill
in
this
regard
a
new

is
developed
to
evaluate
the
main
drivers

the
developed
framework
is
proposed
a
decision
approach
that
can
effectively
use
the
presented
information
to
make
decisions
of
high
rationality
this
framework
is
applied
to
compute
the

and
it
is
used
to
assess
the

study
to
evaluate
the
main
drivers
for
the

is
taken
according

the
findings
the
most
significant
drivers
for
the
implementation
of

also
comparison
and
sensitivity
investigation
are
made
to
show
the
superiority
of
the
developed
framework
children
are
highly
inclined
to
attend
to
the
properties
of
numbers
operations
and
equality
when
given
helpful
tools
for
doing
so
our
aim
was
to
investigate
early
algebraic
thinking
with
the
compensation
property
of
equality
for
subtraction
we
provided
22
9–11-year-old
students
with
physical
blocks
for
building
vertical
towers
and
conducted
individual
interviews
with
them
as
they
completed
a
sequence
of
15
tasks
involving
subtraction
as
difference
using
concrete
numeric
and
symbolic
representations
relational
thinking
was
evidenced
across
a
range
of
subtraction
calculation
skill
levels
those
students
who
could
use
both
indirect
addition
and
take-away
strategies
flexibly
depending
on
the
size
of
the
numbers
involved
were
more
likely
to
evidence
attention
to
generality
with
symbolic
equations
the
shift
to
symbolic
equations
elicited
some
students’
productive
attempts
to
connect
subtraction
as
difference
and
subtraction
as
take
way
but
seemed
to
hinder
others
by
provoking
a
return
to
take
away
calculations
rather
than
relational
thinking
strategies
as
content
generated
by
artificial
intelligence
ai
has
become
more
accessible
and
higher
quality
social
debates
have
intensified
therefore
this
study
investigates
how
people
perceive
and
evaluate
ai-generated
content
and
accounts
compared
to
human-created
accounts
and
content
we
created
instagram
accounts
representing
ai
influencers
and
the
public
and
conducted
a
user
study
with
43
participants
the
participants
had
difficulty
distinguishing
ai
accounts
from
human
ones
moreover
there
were
significant
differences
in
user
perceptions
concerning
the
three
account
types
participants
perceived
the
ai
and
influencer
accounts
as
more
attractive
than
the
public
account
and
they
rated
the
quality
of
ai-generated
content
as
highly
as
that
created
by
influencers
these
findings
suggest
that
the
advancement
of
generative
ai
could
alter
the
social
media
landscape
and
contribute
to
discussions
on
the
characteristics
and
ethical
problems
of
ai-generated
content
science
and
engineering
practices
seps
can
help
students
make
sense
of
and
engage
with
the
natural
and
designed
world
though
using
seps
can
support
student
epistemic
agency
this
is
compromised
when
students
do
not
perceive
seps
as
meaningful
to
sensemaking
this
study
explores
the
relationship
between
students’
perspectives
of
the
sep
of
argumentation
and
the
epistemic
agency
they
exhibit
three
themes
emerged
pertaining
how
students’
understandings
of
the
design
tasks’
participation
framework
and
greater
applications
impacted
their
epistemic
agency
findings
suggest
the
importance
of
making
explicit
to
students
the
rationales
behind
new
student
expectations
to
prevent
“pseudo-student
epistemic
agency”
and
shed
light
on
the
significance
of
fostering
equitable
classroom
communities
where
all
members
are
viewed
as
valuable
and
capable
sensemakers
the
emergence
of
additive
manufacturing
and
3d
printing
technologies
is
introducing
industrial
skills
deficits
and
opportunities
for
new
teaching
practices
in
a
range
of
subjects
and
educational
settings
in
response
research
investigating
these
practices
is
emerging
across
a
wide
range
of
education
disciplines
but
often
without
reference
to
studies
in
other
disciplines
responding
to
this
problem
this
article
synthesizes
these
dispersed
bodies
of
research
to
provide
a
state-of-the-art
literature
review
of
where
and
how
3d
printing
is
being
used
in
the
education
system
through
investigating
the
application
of
3d
printing
in
schools
universities
libraries
and
special
education
settings
six
use
categories
are
identified
and
described
1
to
teach
students
about
3d
printing
2
to
teach
educators
about
3d
printing
3
as
a
support
technology
during
teaching
4
to
produce
artefacts
that
aid
learning
5
to
create
assistive
technologies
and
6
to
support
outreach
activities
although
evidence
can
be
found
of
3d
printing-based
teaching
practices
in
each
of
these
six
categories
implementation
remains
immature
and
recommendations
are
made
for
future
research
and
education
policy
there
is
long-standing
and
widespread
support
for
educational
initiatives
that
introduce
undergraduates
to
scientific
research
research
experiences
can
lead
to
gains
in
students’
general
skills
such
as
oral
visual
and
written
communication
as
well
as
more
specific
research-associated
skills
traditionally
undergraduates
have
been
introduced
to
research
primarily
through
the
apprentice
model
in
which
undergraduates
join
a
research
group
and
receive
one-on-one
guidance
from
a
mentor
this
model
while
effective
limits
the
number
of
students
who
can
engage
in
research
experiences
and
tends
to
be
more
accessible
to
students
who
are
familiar
with
the
research
enterprise
there
is
therefore
an
increasing
emphasis
on
developing
opportunities
for
students
to
engage
in
research
in
credit-bearing
courses
extending
the
benefits
of
research
experiences
to
a
larger
and
more
diverse
group
these
course-based
research
experiences
can
provide
many
of
the
same
benefits
students
derive
from
traditional
undergraduate
research
experiences
such
as
increased
content
knowledge
and
analytical
skills
and
persistence
in
science
this
chapter
describes
important
characteristics
of
course-based
research
experiences
and
provides
examples
that
range
from
national
programs
to
single
courses
developed
by
individual
instructors
we
end
the
chapter
by
offering
practical
suggestions
to
help
instructors
design
an
effective
course-based
research
experience
children
from
underserved
minoritized
and
immigrant
families
have
less
access
to
early
out-of-school

opportunities
playful

increase
the
accessibility
of

by
merging
principles
of

goals
with
local

we
used

to
1
identify

and
2
create

our
design
partners
were
32
parents
primarily
spanish-speaking
immigrant
mothers
from

the
design
process
consisted
of
co-design

our
findings
showed
that
familismo
heritage
representation
and
the
meaning
of

spaces
influenced
the
ways
families
engaged
in
stem
learning
and
the
learning
environments
they
desired
in
their
community
moreover
families’
stem
practices
were
rooted
in
everyday
experiences
of
playing
cultural
games
family
food
routines
and
outdoor
activities
incorporating
latine
parents
in
the
design
process
and
leveraging
their
funds
of

resulted
in
culturally
situated

aligned
with
playful

contributes
to

this

the
findings
can
inform
the
development
and
implementation
of
professional
learning
programs
and
policymaking
the
motivation
to
stimulate
children’s
learning
engagement
could
be
found
in
the
fact
that
learning
is
not
always
motivational
in
itself
this
is
particularly
true
when
learning
is
obligatory
and
based
upon
material
that
has
not
been
chosen
by
the
children
themselves
a
lean
ux
approach
to
the
co-design
of
an
educational
serious
videogame
mobi
is
proposed
in
this
paper
the
core
idea
is
that
childrens
natural
interest
in
playing
can
be
stimulated
by
engendering
the
feeling
that
they
are
participating
in
the
creation
of
something
the
hypothesis
is
that
this
approach
can
increase
the
childrens
level
of
engagement
and
can
facilitate
their
awareness
of
their
learning
perception
with
the
aim
of
testing
this
hypothesis
this
paper
describes
an
experience
with
50
children
with
ages
between
10
and
12
years
old
the
results
indicate
that
the
children’s
satisfaction
grew
significantly
during
the
process
with
an
important
reduction
in
the
requests
for
changes
and
that
60
had
the
perception
of
having
learned
it
can
be
concluded
that
the
co-design
based
upon
a
lean
ux
methodology
of
a
children’s
educational
serious
videogame
increases
their
level
of
product
engagement
and
facilitates
their
awareness

self-regulation
plays
a
critical
role
in

however
there
is
limited
research
investigating
whether
and
how
self-regulation
leads
to

this

analyzes
the

students
using
principal

analysis
and
cluster
analysis
it
classifies
the
students
into
four
distinct
types
competent
cognitive-oriented
reflective-oriented
and
minimally
self-regulated

competent
self-regulated
learners
perceived
themselves
as
the
most
self-regulated
learners
and
had
the
greatest
learning
gains
although
they
did
not
perform
best
in
the
task
cognitive-oriented
self-regulated
learners
perceived
themselves
as
the
least
self-regulated
learners
although
they
were
the
second
best
in
both
the
performance
of
the
task
and
learning
gains
in
contrast
reflective

had
the
best
performance
in
the
task
minimally
self-regulated
learners
did
not
perform
well
in
the
task
and
had
the
lowest
learning
gains
the
results
revealed
that
the
competent
self-regulated
learners
had
an
appropriate
assessment
of
themselves
to
obtain
knowledge
cognitive-oriented
self-regulated
learners
underestimated
themselves
reflective
learners
focused
on
the
results
of
the
task
and
minimally
self-regulated
learners
overestimated
themselves
and
exerted
the
least
effort
the
results
also
offer

recently
the
term
“fake
news”
has
been
broadly
and
extensively
utilized
for
disinformation
misinformation
hoaxes
propaganda
satire
rumors
click-bait
and
junk
news
it
has
become
a
serious
problem
around
the
world
we
present
a
new
system
fands
that
detects
fake
news
efficiently
the
system
is
based
on
several
concepts
used
in
some
previous
works
but
in
a
different
context
there
are
two
main
concepts
an
inconsistency
graph
and
energy
flow
the
inconsistency
graph
contains
news
items
as
nodes
and
inconsistent
opinions
between
them
for
edges
energy
flow
assigns
each
node
an
initial
energy
and
then
some
energy
is
propagated
along
the
edges
until
the
energy
distribution
on
all
nodes
converges
to
illustrate
fands
we
use
the
original
data
from
the
fake
news
challenge
fnc-1
first
the
data
has
to
be
reconstructed
in
order
to
generate
the
inconsistency
graph
the
graph
contains
various
subgraphs
with
well-defined
shapes
that
represent
different
types
of
connections
between
the
news
items
then
the
energy
flow
method
is
applied
the
nodes
with
high
energy
are
the
candidates
for
being
fake
news
in
our
experiments
all
these
were
indeed
fake
news
as
we
checked
each
using
several
reliable
web
sites
we
compared

focuses
on
whether
network
media
information
about
the
covid-19
pandemic
has
had
a
significant
impact
on
the
online
knowledge
acquisition
of
college
students
this
research
is
of
great
significance
as
it
can
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
way
we
think
about
knowledge
acquisition
in
the
future
yet
a
recent
literature
review
finds
that
the
academic
community
has
not
paid
attention
to
this
important
topic
in
the
present
work
which
is
based
on
a
survey
of
5000
chinese
college
students
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
period
we
find
that
covid-19
information
from
mainstream
chinese
media
and
overseas
media
as
well
as
social
media
has
had
a
significant
promoting
effect
on
the
online
knowledge
acquisition
of
college
students
at
the
same
time
the
psychological
response
to
the
pandemic
situation
is
shown
to
have
had
a
significant
mediating
effect
on
the
relationship
between
the
information
impact
from
mainstream
chinese
and
overseas
media
and
the
online
knowledge
acquisition
of
college
students
our
findings
have
shown
that
the
more
positive
college
students
are
in
responding
to
the
pandemic
the
stronger
their
willingness
is
to
acquire
knowledge
through
online
means
and
the
better
effect
this
will
have
on
them
acquiring
knowledge
the
results
of
this
paper
have
important
implications
for
the
optimization
and
improvement
of
college
students’
education
and
knowledge
acquisition
methods
in
the
context
of
the
long-term
covid-19
pandemic
in
this
paper
we
present
a
structured
report
on
a
dialogue
on
the
future
of
computing
and
wisdom
the
dialogue
consists
of
a
recorded
and
transcribed
discussion
between
researchers
and
practitioners
in
the
field
of
human–computer
interaction
that
was
held
at
workshop
in
conjunction
with
the
10th
nordic
conference
on
human–computer
interaction
in
september
2018
however
the
dialogue
also
encompasses
workshop
participants’
preparatory
work
with
writing
“fictional
abstracts”
–
abstracts
of
yet-to-be-written
research
papers
that
will
be
published
in
2068
the
polyvocal
dialogue
that
is
reported
upon
thus
includes
not
just
the
voices
of
researchers
and
practitioners
who
attended
the
workshop
but
also
includes
the
voices
of
the
future
researchers
of
2068
who
wrote
the
abstracts
in
question
as
well
as
the
voices
of
the

and
to
the

it
often

to
hone
your

or
the
skills
that
are

that
you
can
do
the
job
even
when
you
do
not

will
do
this
by
learning
to

broadly
and
comprehensively
about
your

for
everything
that
you

there
is
an

to
you
as
a

how
to
describe
them

field
today
in
medicine
performing

is
gathered
without

purposes
of
this
chapter
this
“coming

be
delineated
as
the

how
this
will

abstract
this
study
aimed
to
examine
how
imaginative
capabilities
act
as
a
mediator
between
personality
traits
and
academic
performance
and
to
compare
the
different
ways
these
factors
affect
engineering
and
science
majors
the
hypotheses
were
tested
with
data
from
five
universities
across
different
regions
in
taiwan
the
participants
were
a
sample
of
700
undergraduates
who
were
divided
into
engineering
and
science
groups
the
results
showed
that
through
the
mediator
effect
of
imaginative
capabilities
conscientiousness
had
the
greatest
impact
on
academic
performance
among
engineering
and
science
groups
agreeableness
was
identified
as
the
second
major
predictor
of
student
performance
in
both
groups
the
influence
of
openness
on
student
performance
was
slight
and
positive
whereas
that
of
extraversion
was
slight
and
negative
the
major
differences
in

were
the
direct
results
of

introduces
the
innovative
concept
of
platform

specifically
within
the
context
of
digital
platforms
in
todays
digital
economy
where
digital
platforms
are
essential
tools
in
peoples
lives
and
form
the
core
of
the
digital
ecosystem
the
ability
to
effectively
utilize
these
platforms
is
becoming
crucial
this
study
systematically
examines
the
existing
literature
on
digital
platforms
and
digital
literacy
to
establish
a
conceptual
foundation
for
assessing
an
individuals
platform
literacy
drawing
upon
insights
from
the
digital
literacy
framework
we
propose
a
platform
literacy
framework
that
can
be
applied
in
practical
settings
methodologically
we
conducted
an
extensive
review
of
735
research
papers
on
digital
literacies
to
gather
definitions
and
frameworks
as
a
result
we
identified
seven
core
constructs
and
three
main
proficiencies
that
constitute
the
platform
literacy
framework
moreover
to
adapt
the
framework
to
the
various
digital
platform
contexts
we
categorized
it
into
fixed
and
variable
attributes
this
paper
contributes
to
the
growing
body
of
knowledge
on
digital
literacy
by
offering
a
comprehensive
framework
for
understanding
platform
literacy
within
the
digital
platform
landscape
researchers
can
use
a
participatory
design
approach
to
produce
sustainable
interventions
that
leverage
the
cultural
values
and
practices
of
ethnoculturally
and
linguistically
diverse
populations
pd
is
underutilized
in
developmental
psychology
but
can
be
a
powerful
tool
for
creating
culturally
situated
interventions
that
bridge
gaps
in
research
applicability
inclusivity
and
effectiveness
we
provide
our
design
narrative
for
creating
grocery
store
signage
promoting
early
stem
learning
in
a
predominantly
low-income
latine
community
we
conducted
two
design
sessions
with
our
research
team
and
community
members
n
20
to
learn
about
their
past
and
present
intergenerational
grocery-shopping
experiences
and
integrated
their
values
into
signage
this
paper
outlines
the
pd
process
we
undertook
and
its
implications
for
the
field
of
developmental
psychology
we
argue
that
developmental
psychologists
would
benefit
from
adopting
pd
as
a
methodology
to
build
on
diverse
populations
strengths
this
approach
can
produce
relevant
interventions
that
support

the
chapter
aims
to
propose
a
conceptual
framework
of
metabolomics
in
public
health
as
metabolomics
between
the
many
post-genomic
study
methods
has
a
true
horizontal
approach
because
it
studies
the
universe
of
the
small
molecules
it
unravels
signals
which
are
downstream
from
genes
and
much
more
near
to
the
phenotype
phenomena
of
a
disease
or
condition
to
address
these
concepts
a
number
of
themes
are
discussed
namely
the
data
integration
at
different
levels
the
relationship
of
metabolomics
with
the
systems
biology
public
health
science
the
relevance
and
role
of
longitudinal
and
lifelong
studies
the
role
of
the
quantitative
methods
the
connection
with
big
data
in
public
health
with
the
possible
evolution
towards
a
“precision
public
health”
and
finally
the
process
of
knowledge
integration
in
the
fields
of
policies
training
and
resources
with
the
final
goal
of
a
strong
translation
of
metabolomic
tools
from
research
to
practice
micro-controllers
like
arduino
are
increasingly
used
in
classroom
settings
to
teach
skills
attitudes
and
knowledge
around
technology
education
around
these
tools
is
often
set
in
group
contexts
and
collaboration
is
typically
considered
an
important
part
of
the
learning
process
however
much
of
the
software
tools
currently
available
are
still
designed
around
a
laptop
programming
paradigm
that
tends
to
restrict
collaboration
rather
than
encourage
shifting
of
roles
and
sharing
of
experiences
this
paper
explores
how
to
design
tools
that
invite
collaborative
interactions
in
particular
how
mobile
software
tools
with
heavy
usage
of
video
as
an
interactive
resource
could
allow
for
collaborative
sketching
and
understanding
based
on
contextual
inquiries
with
educators
observations
and
engagements
with
students
in
classroom
settings
and
a
workshop
with
arduino
education
this
paper
sketches
out
a
vision
for
how
the
software
tools
used
for
learning
physical
computing
can
be
re-designed
to
better
work
within
the
context
of
group
work
from
the
observations
for
groups
of
students
aged
14–16-years
old
making
is
a
recent
educational
phenomenon
that
is
increasingly
occurring
in
schools
and
informal
learning
spaces
around
the
world
in
this
paper
we
explore
data
from
maker
educators
about
their
experiences
with
failure
we
surveyed
maker
educators
about
how
they
view
failure
happening
with
youth
in
their
formal
and
informal
programs
and
how
they
respond
the
results
reveal
some
concrete
strategies
that
seem
to
show
promise
for
helping
educators
increase
the
likelihood
that
failure
experiences
for
youth
can
lead
to
gains
in
learning
and
persistence
improving
e-learning
involves
various
levels
of

accordingly
researchers
usually
adopt
complex
research
designs
with
a
multilevel

to
capture
a

comprehension
and

a
total
of
76

with
hierarchical

as
a

in
13
major
e-learning
journals
from
january
2000
to
september

we
assessed
the

characteristics
sample

model
characteristics
variables
used
in
the

and
main
technology
used
in

research
the
results
revealed
that
two-level
models
and
random-intercept
models
are
mostly
used
in
multilevel
model
building
moreover
most
e-learning
studies
included
two-level
random
intercept
models
with
“students”
as
sampling
units
of
analysis
in
level
1
and
“cognitive

ie
examination

achievement
as
the
dependent
variable
in
level

based
on
our
review
results
we
provide
suggestions
and
potential
applications
of
using
multilevel
modeling
in
e-learning
studies
we
give
an
operational
semantics
for
the
evaluation
of
spreadsheets
including
sheet-defined
and
built-in
numeric
functions
in
the
funcalc
spreadsheet
platform
the
semantics
allows
for
different
implementations
and
we
discuss
sheet-defined
functions
implemented
using
both
interpretation
and
run-time
code
generation
the
semantics
specifies
the
expected
result
of
a
computation
also
considering
non-deterministic
functions
independently
of
an
evaluation
mechanism
it
can
be
extended
to
include
the
cost
of
formula
evaluation
for
a
cost
analysis
eg
for
use
in
parallelization
of
computations
an
interesting
future
direction
is
to
investigate
experimentally
how
close
our
semantics
is
to
that
of
major
spreadsheet
implementations
the
research
interest
in
the
use
of
augmented

smart
glasses
arsgs
has
increased
dramatically
in
recent
years
as
they
are
utilised
in
many
fields
such
as
medicine
and
industry
as
well
as
everyday
life
this
study
aims
to
review
the
empirical
research
activity
concerning
the
acceptance
of
arsgs
in
all
applicable
fields
in
total
21
studies
published
from
2015
to
2022
have
been
reviewed
their
relative
field
theoretical
framework
methodological
design
and
the
factors
that
were
found
to
affect
the
acceptance
or
use
of
arsgs
were
recorded
it
was
found
that
the
research
focuses
more
on
users
acting
as
consumers
of
the
glasses
than
on
professionals
eg
doctors
teachers
athletes
using
them
in
a
specific
field
also
the
majority
of
the
studies
base
their
theoretical
framework
either
entirely
or
in
part
on
the
technology
acceptance
model
tam
moreover
the
research
models
of
these
studies
extend
tam
by
using
various
additional
variables
such
as
privacy
risk
and
external
influence
methodologically
speaking
most
of
the
studies
follow
the
quantitative
approach
without
giving
the
participants
the
opportunity
to
interact
with
the
glasses
in
addition
the
factors
which
were
found
to
influence
the
acceptance
or
use
of
the
glasses
are
varied
and
can
be
categorised
as
utilitarian
social
personal
risk-related
and
technological
this
review
adds
value
to
the
theory
of
technology
acceptance
this
is
because
it
is
one
of
the
first
to
address
the
acceptance
or
use
of
arsgs
since
there
is
no
acceptance
model
for
arsgs
the
findings
of
this
review
could
lead
researchers
to
propose
models
for
accepting
arsgs
in
various
fields
such
as
education
increasing
numbers
of
children
and
young
people
are
experiencing
immersive
virtual
reality
as
part
of
leisure
and
schooling
immersive
virtual
reality
mediated
through
head-mounted
displays
presents
significant
challenges
as
well
as
tantalising
opportunities
for
learning
within
schools
the
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
report
on
key
issues
that
arose
when
embedding
immersive
virtual
reality
for
learning
into
ict
and
science
classes
in
low-income
high
schools
by
providing
a
fine-grained
account
of
how
the
research
team
negotiated
scholarly
and
practical
problems
the
mixed
method
research
used
a
participatory
approach
with
teachers
as
co-researchers
three
areas
are
explored
i
the
ethical
and
safety
issues
of
using
ivr
in
classrooms
ii
negotiating
the
organisational
context
of
a
school
system
and
problem-solving
within
the
context
of
institutional
restrictions
on
internet
access
and
iii
educational
reflections
on
collaborative_learning
and
gendered
dynamics
we
conclude
that
classrooms
as
socially
active
and
sometimes
unpredictable
places
yield
unique
and
credible
insights
into
the
deployment
of
highly
immersive
virtual
reality
for
learning
early
research
investigated
young
students
understandings
of
science
concepts
using
physical
equipment
but
technological
advances
now
mean
there
are
new
options
to
introduce
these
ideas
through
devices
such
as
ipads
and
simulations
however
research
investigating
the
use
of

is
limited
this

and
electricity
concepts
and
the
function
of

components
it
also
explored
whether
their
engagement
with
the
simulations
provided
worthwhile
opportunities
to
exercise
higher

capabilities
such
as
reflective
thinking
and
abstraction
–
skills
oftencited
in
literature
as
valuable
outcomes
from
older
student
and
adult
use
of

findings
indicate
students
developed
a
solid
base
of
procedural
knowledge
about
constructing
different
circuits
and
functional
knowledge
about
circuit
components
they
applied
to
different
circuit
designs
the
emergence
of
tentative
generalised
theories
about
current
and
the
effects
of
different
circuit
designs
on
the
performance
of
resistors
-
linked
to
the
exercise
of
reflective
and
descriptive
thinking
were
also
noted
in
many
students
however
examples
were
found
of
some
simulations
appearing
to
foster
common
misconceptions
such
as
current
being
‘consumed’
by
resistors
–
indicating
teachers
need
to
be
highly
vigilant
and
work
closely
with

this
paper
presents
a
historical
perspective
on
the
origin
of
the
enactive
approach
to
cognitive
science
starting
chronologically
from
cybernetics
with
the
aim
of
clarifying
its
main
concepts
such
as
enaction
autopoiesis
structural
coupling
and
natural
drift
thus
showing
their
influences
in
computational
approaches
and
models
of
cognitive
architecture
works
of
renowned
authors
as
well
as
some
of
their
main
commentators
were
addressed
to
report
the
development
of
enactive
approach
we
indicate
that
the
enactive
approach
transcends
its
original
context
within
biology
and
at
a
second
moment
within
connectionism
changes
the
understanding
of
the
relationships
so
far
established
between
the
body
and
the
environment
and
the
ideas
of
conceptual
relationships
between
the
mind
and
the
body
the
influence
on
computational
theories
is
of
great
importance
leading
to
new
artificial
intelligence
systems
as
well
as
the
proposition
of
complex
autopoietic
and
alive
machines
finally
the
article
stresses
the
importance
of
the
enactive
approach
in
the
design
of
agents
understanding
that
previous
approaches
have
very
different
cognitive
architectures
and
that
a
prototypical
model
of
enactive
cognitive
architecture
is
one
of
the
largest
challenges
today
the
increasing
interest
in
materiality
currently
challenges
the
long
existing
traditions
that
consider
visual
thinking
as
the
primary
actor
in
design
creativity
shape

offer
a
formalism
to
represent
visual
reasoning
in

which
is
never
purely
limited
to
the
visual
aspects
of
design
processes
aiming
to
develop
ways
to
explicitly
include
material
manipulation
in
a
computational
formalism
we
report
on
an
ongoing
exploration
of
how
shape
computation
extends
beyond
abstract
visual
shapes
to
incorporate
material
shapes
that
have
a
physical
existence
we
present
a
materially
informed
process
with
shape
rules
and
show
that
we
can
apply
these
rules
creatively
to
explore
the
physical
character
of
the
material

difficulty
levels
ie
simple

furthermore
we
also
found
that

shortcomings
of

have
been
widely
identified
and
interest
has
largely
shifted
to

however
the
development
of

still
requires
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
social
resources
of
individuals
and
the
interdependencies
of

this
study
examined
the
extent
to
which
sociodemographic
factors

predict
digital

skills
and
which
subgroups
emerge
as
potential

was
found
to
be
the
inverse
of

mastery
of
these

digital
self-efficacy

also
emerged
as

highlighting
that

are
explained
more
strongly
by

than
by

end
the
practical

and
recommendations
for

as
well
as
for

are
considered
on
the

children’s
perceptions
of

with
robots
is
a
well-researched
topic
but
more
focus
is
needed
on
the
important
role
of
play
in
child–robot
interaction
play
is
essential
to
how
children
experience
the
world
and
thereby
presents
both
opportunities
and
challenges
for
designers
who
aim
to
create
positive
experiences
for

we
present
a
study
investigating
how
a
simple
play-facilitating
cardboard
robot
becomes
a
social
interface
and
create
meaningful
and
playful
experiences
for
preschool
children
we
observed
214
children
engaged
in
free
play
with
the
robot
the
analysis
produced
four
social
interaction
themes
and
five
play
patterns
illustrating
the
most
salient
reactions
the
results
show
that
the
robot
was
successful
in
enabling
play
and
that
the
children
indeed
treated
the
robot
both
as
a
social
agent
but
also
as
a
material
object
in
line
with
existing
research
our
observations
suggest
that
the
children
attributed
both
animate
and
inanimate
properties
to
the
robot
possibly
explaining
the
duality
of
the
observed
playground
behavior
we
use
these
findings
to
provide
four
implications
for

however
the

the

been
reported
as
some

this

this

the

assessment
and

used
in
real

over

we
find
that
efforts
to
teach
ai
ethics
do
helpfully
draw
on
a
holistic
view
as
opposed
to
a
narrow
view
and
utilize
progressive
pedagogies
like
case

and
group

that
aim
to
meaningfully
challenge
students’
ethical

skills
in

however
many
real-
world
ai

do
not
leverage
well-supported
assessment
techniques
known
to
support

rather
assessment
is
conducted
primarily
for

evaluative
purposes
this
gap
in
rigorous
assessment
raises
implications
for
researchers
and
practitioners
as
responsible

and

be
stymied
if

the
archaeological
record
has
been
described
as
a
key
to
the
long-term
consequences
of
human
action
that
can
help
guide
our
decisions
today
yet
the
sparse
and
incomplete
nature
of
this
record
often
makes
it
impossible
to
inferentially
reconstruct
past
societies
in
sufficient
detail
for
them
to
serve
as
more
than
very
general
cautionary
tales
of
coupled
socio-ecological
systems
however
when
formal
and
computational
modeling
is
used
to
experimentally
simulate
human
socioecological
dynamics
the
empirical
archaeological
record
can
be
used
to
validate
and
improve
dynamic
models
of
long
term
change
in
this
way
knowledge
generated
by
archaeology
can
play
a
unique
and
valuable
role
in
developing
the
tools
to
make
more
informed
decisions
that
will

an
example
of
using
the

that

developing
interdisciplinary
undergraduate

is
challenging
at
all
levels
it
requires
involving
trained
faculty
who
can
successfully
cover
more
than
one
discipline
and
creating
a
new
curriculum
that
crosses
discipline
boundaries
while
such
integrative
curricula
are
expected
in
a
graduate
school
setting
they
are
challenging
at
the
undergraduate
level
since
they
require
proficiency
in
multiple
disciplines
however
making
this
transition
to
interdisciplinary
project-based
teaching
at
the
undergraduate
level
gives
a
competitive
edge
to
undergraduates
as
part
of
a
broader
effort
of
developing
a

the
increased

has
enormous
implications
not

for
instructional

but
also
for

maker-oriented

have
the
potential
to
shed

on
types
of

have
not
captured

nevertheless
little
is

2
in
what

our

revealed
several
ways
in

experienced
the
advantages
of
the

and
for
helping

also
revealed
challenges
to
conducting

one
promising
avenue
for

is
for

–
that
is
how

genai
is
penetrating
in
various
social
sectors
motivating
a
strong
need
for
teaching

literacy
in
younger
generations
while
substantial
efforts
have
been
made
to
teach
ai

and
to
use
ai
to
facilitate

few
studies
have
provided
empirical
accounts
of

nuanced
processes
of
using
genai
for

in
this
study
we
engaged
a
group
of
high_school
students
in
leveraging
chatgpt
to
support
their
knowledge
building
efforts
following
the
teachers
pedagogical
design
students
used
chatgpt
for
a
range
of
distinct
purposes
student
interviews
showed
detailed
processes
of
using
chatgpt
for

building
and
students
emerging
ai
literacy
in
multiple
dimensions
this
study
offers
practical
implications
for
the
integration
of
genai
in
k-12
education
and
urges
educators
to
create
spaces
and
scaffolds
for

to
mindfully
engage

a
scalable
parallel
algorithm
has
been
designed
to
study
long-time
dynamics
of
many-atom
systems
based
on
the
nudged
elastic
band
method
which
performs
mutually
constrained
molecular
dynamics
simulations
for
a
sequence
of
atomic
configurations
or
states
to
obtain
a
minimum
energy
path
between
initial
and
final
local
minimum-energy
states
a
directionally
heated
nudged
elastic
band
method
is
introduced
to
search
for
thermally
activated
events
without
the
knowledge
of
final
states
which
is
then
applied
to
an
ensemble
of
bands
in
a
path
ensemble
method
for
long-time
simulation
in
the
framework
of
the
transition
state
theory
the
resulting
molecular
kinetics
mk
simulation
method
is
parallelized
with
a
space–time-ensemble
parallel
nudged
elastic
band
step-neb
algorithm
which
employs
spatial
decomposition
within
each
state
while
temporal
parallelism
across
the
states
within
each
band
and
band-ensemble
parallelism
are
implemented
using
a
hierarchy
of
communicator
constructs
in
the
message
passing
interface
library
the
step-neb
algorithm
exhibits
good
scalability
with
respect
to
spatial
temporal
and
ensemble
decompositions
on
massively
parallel
computers
the
mk
simulation
method
is
used
to
study
low
strain-rate
deformation
of
amorphous
silica
to
tackle
the
problem
of
efficiently
managing
increasingly
complex
systems
simulation
models
have
been
widely
used
this
is
because
simulation
is
safer
less
expensive
and
faster
than
field
implementation
and
experimenting
to
achieve
high
fidelity
and
credibility
in
conducting
prediction
and
exploration
of
the
actual
system
with

models
a
rigorous
calibration
and
validation
procedure
should
firstly
be
applied
however
one
of
the
key
issues
in
calibration
is
the
acquisition
of
valid
source
information
from
the
target
system
the
aim
of
this
study
is
to
develop
a
systematic
method
to
automatically
calibrate
a
general
emergency
department
model
with
incomplete
data
the
simulation-based
optimization
was
used
to
search
for
the
best
value
of
model
parameters
then
we
present
a
case
study
to
particularly
demonstrate
the
way
to
calibrate
an
agent-based
model
of
an
emergency
department
with
real
data
scarcity
the
case
study
indicates
that
the
proposed
method
appears
to
be
capable
of
properly
calibrating
and
validating
the
simulation
model
with
incomplete
data
the
goal
of
this
study
is
to
examine
the
effects
of
learner
control
on
information
security
isec
training
effectiveness
while
organizations
recognize
the
importance
of
education
and
training
in
security
and
invest
in
such
efforts
the
design
of
these
programs
often
lacks
theoretical
grounding
and
the
outcomes
are
often
not
critically
evaluated
this
paper
attempts
to
fill
these
gaps
by
1
identifying
desirable
characteristics
for
the
design
of
such
training
programs
2
using
these
characteristics
as
guidelines
to
design
a
web-based
information

3
experimentally
evaluating
the
effectiveness
of
the
training
using
critical
outcomes
such
as
training
satisfaction
security
training
performance
self-efficacy
perceived
threat
severity
and
susceptibility
we
find
that
web
based
isec
training
that
incorporates
learner
control
positively
affects
training
reactions
and

outcomes
machine

have
an
ever-increasing
presence
and

on
a
wide-variety
of

aims
at

consequently
historical

leading
to
a

styles
including
inadequate

that
reduces

and
shortening
the

for

64
of

did
not
include
any

insufficient
reporting
of

geoarchives
severely
hampers
reproducibility
and
data
reusability
especially
in
analyses
that
make
use
of

reproducibility

is
fundamental
to
further
analyses
of
the
number
of

and
the

we
suggest
and
justify
a
set
of
minimum

we
analyse

and
make
recommendations
to

to

the
value
of

we
provide
empirical

these
guidelines
increase

has
been
on
the
agenda
of

cci
research
for
a
long
time
recently
the
notion
of
the
computational
empowerment
of
children
has
received
attention
however
there
are
still
open
issues
in
our
understanding
and
advocacy
of
it
a
related
development
is
the
recent
interest
in
the
longer-term
impacts
of
our
work
fast
and
furious
participation
of
children
in
design
sessions
is
considered
inadequate
we
should
advocate
for
longer-term
trajectories
and
possibilities
for
children
to
make
changes
that
will
influence
our
world
however
the
literature
is
limited
in
addressing
longer-term
impacts
this
study
taps
into
these
two
research
gaps
and
showcases
how
we
have
addressed
the
computational
empowerment
of
children
in
a
project
tackling
bullying
at
school
through
critical
design
and
making
in
this
paper
we
examine
in
detail
the
children’s
designs
and
their
trajectories
from
the
viewpoint
of
empowerment
and
impact
whether
and
how
these
children’s
designs
show
potential
for
the
empowerment
of
those
bullied
and
whether
and
how
their
designs
have
had
an
impact
in
the
realm
of
digital

development
our
study
has
interesting
conceptual
and
methodological
implications
for
cci
research
and

on
the
computational

and
on
our

research
practice
educational
games
are
assumed
to
be
an
effective
and
efficient
instructional
strategy
for
computing
education
however
it
is
essential
to
systematically
evaluate
such
games
in
order
to
obtain
sound
evidence
of
their
impact
thus
the
objective
of
this
article
is
to
present
the
state
of
the
art
on
how
games
for
computing
education
are
evaluated
therefore
we
performed
a
systematic
literature
review
of
a
sample
of
3617
articles
from
which
112
relevant
articles
have
been
identified
describing
117
studies
on
the
evaluation
of
games
for
computing
education
based
on
these
studies
we
analyzed
how

are

analysis
methods
used
as
a
result
we
can
confirm
that
most
evaluations
use
a
simple
research
design
in
which
typically
the
game
is
used
and
afterwards
subjective
feedback
is
collected
via
questionnaires
from
the
learners
the
majority
of
the
evaluations
are
run
with
small
samples
without
replication
using
mostly
qualitative
methods
for
data
analysis
we
also
observed
that
most
studies
do
not
use
a
well-defined
evaluation
model
or
method
this
shows
that
there
is
a
need
for
more
rigorous
evaluations
as
well
as
methodological
support
in
order
to
assist
game
creators
and
instructors
to
improve
such
games
as
well
as
to
systematically
support
decisions
on
when
or
how
to
include
them
within
instructional
units
there
is
little
empirical
evidence
on
cross-domain
relations
with
science
and
other
academic
domains
which
contributes
to
a
limited
understanding
of
the
development
of
early
science
and
how
to
best
support
it
the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
examine
multiple
concurrent
predictors
of
science
core
knowledge
including
executive
functioning
ef
vocabulary
literacy
math
and
math
language
in
preschool
this
study
overcomes
the
limitations
of
previous
work
exploring
relations
between
individual
predictors
by
addressing
potentially
spurious
relations
due
to
acting
as
proxies
for
other
variables
data
were
collected
from
86
preschool-aged
children
36
female
from
families
with
low
incomes
findings
revealed
that
when
ef
vocabulary
literacy
math
and
math
language
were
included
in
the
same
model
as
concurrent
predictors
of
science
only
vocabulary
significantly
predicted
children’s
science
core
knowledge
findings
from
this
study
have
potential
implications
for
the
refinement
of
early
science
skills
and
intervention
development
one
of
the
aims
of
this
work
is
to
revise
the
known
issues
of
how
to
obtain
the
value
of
the
expression
using
an
applicative
computing
system
computation
andor
symbolic
transformations
have
undoubtedly
become
one
of
the
dominant
trends
in
modern
computer
science
in
particular
this
refers
to
the
execution
of
the
processes
of
inference
of
an
object
with
given
properties
which
is
studied
with
the
formation
of
sets
of
equalities
leading
to
a
target
computational
model
at
the
same
time
the
mathematical
theory
of
computation
gets
a
target
equational
description
making
the
process
of
studying
its
properties
and
capabilities
more
suitable
a
model
structure
based
on
the
method
of
indexed
expressions
is
developed
and
applied
using
the
notions
of
evaluation
mapping
and
assignments
as
shown
this
may
not
be
considered
as
generic
notion
but
derived
using
the
combinators
thus
the
semantics
of
computation
can
be
derived
from
the
construction
of
a
combinator-as-process
this
is
the
embedding
into
a
system
of
combinators
a
linking
system
of
equalities
between
combinatorsl
is
established
which
serving
as
a
generic
computational
model
this
allows
us
to
look
differently
at
the
previous
cognitive
ideas
of
the
semantics
of
computation
disabling
an
evaluation
map
and
assignments
and
enabling
their
replacement
by
a
set
of
equalities
between
combinators

be
conceptualized
as

nevertheless
the
research
on
how

dynamically
interact
over

in

is
still
in
its
infancy
especially
in

in
the

we
found
that
the
three

had
no
significant

however
they
differed
in

behaviors
of

both
the
mastery-oriented

performed
more

than
the

moreover
the
mastery-oriented
group
showed
stronger

than
the
success-oriented

and
the
unsuccessful

the

of
the
three
groups
shared
some

but
they
were
different
from

other
in
general
this
study
has
significant
theoretical
and
methodological
implications
for
the
advancement
of
research
in

the
recent
incremental
growth
of

has
made
it

the
aim
of
this

is
to
increase

this

aims
to

of
these
pioneering
language

the
technological

the
availability

led
to
the
emergence
of
a

our
work
tries
to
define
its
scope
and
focuses
on
a
popular
subarea
of
it
namely
“digital
democracy”
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
surge
of
interest
in
using
digital
technologies
to
promote
more
participatory
forms
of
democracy
while
there
are
numerous
potential
benefits
to
using
digital

to
enhance

significant
challenges
must
be
addressed
it
is
essential
to
ensure
that
digital

are
used
in
an
accessible
equitable
and
fair
manner
rather
than
reinforcing
existing
power
imbalances
this
paper
investigates
how
digital
tools
can
be
used
to
help
design
more
democratic
societies
by
investigating
three
key
research
areas
1
the
role
of
digital
technologies
for
facilitating
civic
engagement
in
collective
decision-making
2
the
use
of
digital
tools
to
improve
transparency
and
accountability
in
governance
and
3
the
potential
for
digital
technologies
to
enable
the
formation
of
more
inclusive
and
representative
democracies
we
argue
that
more
research
on
how
digital
technologies
can
be
used
to
support
democracy
upgrade
is
needed
along
these
lines
we
lay
out
a
research
agenda
for
the
future
digital
technology
has
brought
new
opportunities
for
language
education
multimodal
literacy
refers
to
the
ability
to
read
watch
understand
respond
to
and
generate
multimodal
texts
multimodality
promoted
by
scholars
generates
meaning
in
multiple
modes
hence
digital
storytelling
dst
presented
with
multimodal
content
has
been
extensively
applied
in
second
language
instruction
however
traditional
dst
is
mostly
presented
in
videos
with
one-way
communication
it
lacks
two-way
communication
with
the
audience
and
is
only
regarded
as
a
learning
method
for
knowledge
acquisition
as
a
result
the
present
study
proposed
a
robot-based
dst
robot-dst
approach
to
facilitate
the
interaction
in
the
dst
process
and
to
enhance
students
engagement
in
order
to
evaluate
its
effectiveness
a
quasi-experiment
was
conducted
in
an
efl
course
at
a
senior
high_school
two
classes
of
11th
graders
participated
in
the
experiment
one
class
with
40
students
was
the
experimental
group
adopting
the
robot-dst
approach
while
the
other
class
with
40
students
was
the
control
group
adopting
the
conventional
animation-based
dst
ca-dst
approach
the
results
showed
that
the
robot-dst
approach
could
significantly
reduce
students
communication
apprehension
as
well
as
enhance
their
english
speaking
ability
storytelling
ability
narrative
engagement
and
communication
tendency
the
findings
show
that
using
robots
in
the
context
of
digital
storytelling
design
has
great
potential
for
promoting
learners’
language
learning
performances
accordingly
in-depth
discussion
and
suggestions
for
future
research
are
provided
for
researchers
and

teachers
who
intend

in
2013
the
forensic
science
undergraduate
program
fsup
at
the
national
autonomous
university
of
mexico
was
created
in
response
to
an
alarming
criminal
situation
in
mexico
as
well
as
to
the
radical
reform
of
its
criminal
justice
system
its
mission
is
to
educate
and
train
ethical
critical
and
humanistic
forensic
scientists
capable
of
conducting
inquiries
that
meet
scientific
quality
standards
and
assist
the
justice
system
in
firmly
linking
legal
rulings
to
the
available
evidence
at
the
time
it
was
the
first
such
program
in
the
country
and
the
contributions
that
interdisciplinary
forensic
scientists
could
make
to
criminal
investigations
were
largely
unknown
among
forensic
and
legal
practitioners
during
its
existence
providing
an
interdisciplinary
competence-based
education
to
students
has
been
one
of
the
main
challenges
to
overcome
it
teaching
and
assessment
approaches—centered
on
the
achievement
of
specifically
forensic
competencies
as
learning
outcomes
and
the
integration
of
forensic
disciplines
towards
the
resolution
of
simulated
cases—have
been
devised
to
help
develop
the
professional
skill
set
expected
of
graduates
the
covid-19
pandemic
led
to
adapting
these
approaches
to
distance
or
hybrid
modes
of
learning
increasing
their
versatility
and
enriching
the
pedagogic
repertoire
of
the
fsup
currently
the
main
impact
of
the
program
lies
in
the
successful
incorporation
of
some
of
its
graduates
to
agencies
belonging
to
or
related
to
the
criminal
justice
system
such
as
the
national
prosecutor’s
office
the

for
truth
and

for
the
ayotzinapa
case
and
the

the
goal
of
this
narrative

is
to
help
bring

emphasizes
the

research
designs
that
have
been
used
to
examine
content

and
cognitive
skills
among
children
ages
6
to

in
the
context
of
digital

a
corollary
to
the
exponential
growth
of
digital
technology
is
the
increase
in
research
interest
in
the
construct
of
digital

dc
in
diverse
disciplinary
areas
although
the
term
dc
is
used
widely
in

scholars
do
not
commit
to
a
common
definition
this
integrative
review
investigates
the
conceptualizations
and
measurements
of
dc
across
disciplines
in
the
extant
literature
a
systematic
search
of
11
databases
identified
a
total
of
350
unique
items
that
contain
“digital

in
the
title
or

published
by

2018
with
the

published
after
2010
of
these
114

peer-reviewed
journal
articles
published
in
a
wide
range
of
discipline-specific
venues
more
than
half
of
which
were
education-related
in-depth
analyses
show
that
each
of
the
dominant
conceptualizations
of
dc
has
been
adopted
by
different
disciplines
albeit
with
different
popularities
in
adoption
findings
also
revealed
widely
shared
stakeholder
concerns
and
research
foci
in
dc
research
across
the
disciplines
however
there
is
a
stark
lack
of
empirical
research
on
the
young
children
and
an
absence
of
commonly
deployed
research
instruments
in
dc-related
research
the
present
integrative
review
implicates
the
need
for
interdisciplinary
collaboration
for
significant
advances
in
dc
research
to
address
issues
in

augmented

ar
continues
to
show
its

in

while
systematic

most
of

134
quasi-experimental

were
reviewed
to
discern
the
impact
of
ar
on
three
levels
of

outcomes
namely
response
knowledge

the
134

for
meta-analysis
which
were
obtained
following
the
procedure
of

moreover
meta-regression

employed
to
investigate
important
factors
relating
to
the
variation
of
the

including
educational
level
subject

findings
from
the

suggest
that

has
benefited
all

learning
outcomes
with
a
larger

furthermore
the

results
indicate
treatment
duration
as
a
significant
factor
likely
relating

the
variation
in
the

likely
associated
with
higher
positive

the
recent
buzz
around
open

highlighted
the
crucial
problem
of
anonymization
in
the
context
of
data
publishing
many
research
efforts
were
devoted
to
the
definition
of
techniques
performing
such
an
anonymization
however
the
selection
of
the
most
relevant
technique
and
the
adequate
algorithm
is
complex
successful
decision
depends
firstly
on
the
ability
of
data
publishers
to
understand
the
anonymization
techniques
and
their
associated
algorithms
in
this
paper
we
focus
on
the
choice
of
an
algorithm
among
the
different
ones
implementing
one
of
the
anonymization
techniques
namely
generalization
through
an
abstraction
process
presented
in
this
paper
we
provide
data
publishers
with
simplified
descriptions
for
the
generalization
technique
and
its
algorithms
these
descriptions
facilitate
the
understanding
of
the
algorithms
by
data
publishers
having
low
programing
skills
we
present
also
some
other
use
cases
of
these
abstractions
as
well
as
an

conducted

cse
is
a
relatively
new
discipline
for
which
no
consensus
exists
on
how
classes
should
best
be
taught
many
cse
courses
are
compressed
add-ons
to
existing
programs
and
consequently
must
cover
a
breadth
of
topics
encompassing
modules
from
mathematics
statistics
computer
science
and
application
disciplines
additionally
these
courses
would
benefit
from
embedded
21st

skills
including
problem-solving

but
such
skills
are
often
neglected
in

design
even
though
the

are
clear
about
their
importance
for

the

in

necessary
to
incorporate
all
of

create
a

designed
to
address
the
difficulties
associated
with
this
wide

is
based
on
reflective

and
principles
of
metacognition
and
applies
elements
such
as
a

these

goals
directly
support
students’
metacognition
and
foster
self-regulated

that
in
turn
develop

analyzed

poland
the
conducted
research
shows
that
industrial
companies
in
poland
have
more
of
a
short-sighted
perspective
when
it
comes
to
developing
the
potential
of
their
engineers
the
hr
development
practices
focusing
only
on
current
needs
are
not
in
line
with
the
shrm
principles
of
a
long-term
perspective
and
flexibility
there
is
also
a
visible
lack
of
employee
participation
in
the
process
of
making
training-related
decisions
which
is
another
principle
of
sustainable
hrm
in
addition
environmental
sustainability
remains
a
neglected
area
of
knowledge
in
terms
of
training
and
the
cooperation
with
external
educational
institutions
is
low
it
results
in
certain
implications
for
hr
managers
and
educational
institutions
the
article
also
presents
directions
for
further
research
this
paper
starts
from
the
perspective
that
the
current
conceptualization
of
educational
assessment
is
out
of
date
but
particularly
with
regard
to
conception
of
information
and
communication
ict
literacy
we
initially
provide
a
brief
summary
of
the
idea
of
a
21st
century
skill
then
trace
the
conceptual
changes
in
the
idea
of
ict
literacy
in
four
main
steps
first
we
briefly
describe
a
concentration
of
knowledge
about
computers
and
their
use
coalescing
into
the
concept
of
ict
literacy
in
the
early
years
of
the
field
second
we
describe
the
transition
to
a
view
of
ict
literacy
as
a
broad
set
of
skills
that
have
links
to
many
traditional
and
non-traditional
school
subjects
and
the
move
to
technology
integration
in
education
third
we
see
the
next
transition
for
ict
literacy
expressed
as
progress
variables
that
are
essential
tools
for
the
design
of
curriculum
and
assessments
fourth
we
discuss
the
impact
of
the
“social
network”
perspective
on
ict
literacy—the
critical
need
for
building
the
power
of
virtual
skills
through
proficiency
with
networks
of
people
information
tools
and
resources
in
summary
we
offer
a
new
framework
for
assessing
student
ict
learning
based
on
a
learning
progression
and
social
networking
point
of
view
throughout
we
use
extensive
examples
to
help
illustrate
our
review
of
the
broad
sweep
of
this
development
and
as
a
part
of
the
conclusion
we
speculate
about
the
coming
next

this

reflects
on
the
evolution
past
present
and
future
of
the
‘psychology
of

over
the
50
year
period
of
this

issue
the

studies
ijhcs
has
been
a
key
venue
for
much
seminal
work
in
this
field
including
its
first
foundations
and
we
review
the
changing
research
concerns
seen
in
publications
over
these
five
decades
we
relate
this
thematic
evolution
to
research
taking
place
over
the

period
within
more
specialist
communities
especially
the
psychology
of

and
the
ongoing

vlhcc
many

have
interacted
with
psychology
of
programming
both
influenced
by
research
published
within
the
specialist
groups
and
in
turn
influencing
research
priorities
we
end
with
an
overview
of
the
core
theories
that
have
been
developed
over
this
period
as
an
introductory
resource
for
new

creativity
has
been
of
research
interest
to

and
is
currently
recognized
as
one
of
the
essential
skills
needed

in
this
paper
we
briefly
discuss
the

and
provide
an
example
of
current
work
being
done
relative
to
measuring
creativity
in
the
context
of
a
game
called

playground
using
stealth
assessment
to
validate
the
stealth
assessment
of
creativity
we
conducted
a

pretest-posttest
study
with
167
8th
and
9th
graders
from
a
k-12
school
in

results
suggest
that
our
stealth
assessment
of
creativity
is
valid
ie
our
stealth

estimate
significantly
correlated
with
our
external
performance-based
measures
of

additional

revealed
that

significantly
predicts
in-game

two
original
tangible

we
built
on

demonstrated
promising
outcomes
regarding
manipulatives
in

the

tested
in

we
found
that

21st

the
academic
field
of
child–computer
interaction
cci
arose
alongside
burgeoning
interactive
technology
and
digital
media
industries
that
targeted
children
we
believe
that
the
field
of
cciu
is
at
an
important
point
in
its
development
analogous
to
when
a
child
becomes
a
teen
over
the
last
few
years
we
have
each
had
many
informal
conversations
with
other
cci
researchers
in
which
we
discuss
issues
such
as
what
is
our
responsibility
as
researchers
beyond
academe
what
values
underlie
our
conceptions
of
a
”good”
childhood
and
the
role
of
interactive
technology
in
it
and
how
do
we
ensure
that
our
field
continues
to
grow
and
evolve
in
ways
that
are
consistent
with
our
responsibilities
and
values
to
address
these
and
other
complex
questions
that
have
been
drawing
our
attention
we
came
together
to
reflect
discuss
and
create
a
position
paper
for
our
community
in
which
we
outline
some
of
the
issues
we
see
facing
our
community
at
this
time
to
inform
our
deliberations
with
opinions
beyond
our
own
we
conducted
an
informal
consultation
with
25
members
of
the
cci
community
our
responders
spanned
junior
to
senior
researchers
represented
diverse
geographies
and
included
industry
practitioners
these
diverse
responses
provided
further
content
for
our
reflections
and
helped
us
see
perspectives
beyond
our
own
the
result
of
this
informal
process
is
this
speculative
paper
in
which
we
propose
a
series
of
seven
provocations
that
aim
to
disrupt
some
of
the
normative
assumptions
held
in
our
field
our
goal
in
doing
this
is
to
open
up
dialogue
in
our
community
about
these
issues
and
promote
consideration
of
the
alternative
visions
we
present
for
where
we
might
focus
our
attention
and
efforts
we
see
our
contribution
not
as
truth
or
a
definitive
statement
of
a
vision
for
the
field
but
rather
as
our
opinion
about
some
of
the
complex
issues
we
face
and
that
we
think
should
be
considered
through
dialogue
as
we
move
into
the
next
phase
of
our
development
as
an
academic
and
scholarly
community
we
believe
that
it
is
urgent
and
critical
for
our
field
that
we
take
up
these
questions
explore
diverse
perspectives
and
critically
work
towards
decisions
and
actions
that
will
define
our
identity
and
the
value
of
our
contributions
as
we
move
forward
into
the
next
20

summary
todays
increased
availability
of
large
amounts
of
human
behavioral
data
and
advances
in
artificial
intelligence
ai
are
contributing
to
a
growing
reliance
on
algorithms
to
make
consequential
decisions
for
humans
including
those
related
to
access
to
credit
or
medical
treatments
hiring
etc
algorithmic
decision-making
processes
might
lead
to
more
objective
decisions
than
those
made
by
humans
who
may
be
influenced
by
prejudice
conflicts
of
interest
or
fatigue
however
algorithmic
decision-making
has
been
criticized
for
its
potential
to
lead
to
privacy
invasion
information
asymmetry
opacity
and
discrimination
in
this
paper
we
describe
available
technical
solutions
in

large
areas
that
we

to
be
of
critical
importance
to
achieve
a
human-centric

2
accountability

we
also
highlight
the
criticality
and
urgency
to
engage
multi-disciplinary
teams
of
researchers
practitioners
policy
makers
and
citizens
to
co-develop
and
evaluate
in
the
real-world
algorithmic

while
respecting

researchers
and

continuously
remark
on
the
importance
of
integrating
creativity
into
the

this

proposes
a
creativity
approach
to
facilitating
participatory

for
the
sustained
engagement
of
young

based
on
the
principle
of

students
engagement
in
and
perceptions
of
the
creative
learning
process
during
a
two-year
participatory
learning
program
data
collected
included
students’
flow
perceptions
during
a
39-week
activity
their
motivation
and
creative
self-efficacy
before
and
after
the
intervention
as
well
as
their
creative

the
findings
indicated
that
the
remix-oriented
approach
led
to
a
higher
level
of
intrinsic
motivation
and
sustained
flow
compared
to
a
model-based
approach
especially
interest
and
curiosity
in
this
participatory

program
the
approach
also
helped
the
students
to
perceive
a
significant
increase
in
their
level
of
creative
self-efficacy
associated
with
strategies
to
generate
creative

the
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
the
principle
of
remix
practice
is
helpful
for
leveraging
knowledge
acquisition
and
the
creative
nature
of
participatory

activities
to
sustain

in

programs
we
present
a
model
for
incorporating
parallel
and
distributed
computing
pdc
throughout
an
undergraduate
cs
curriculum
our
curriculum
is
designed
to
introduce
students
early
to
parallel
and
distributed
computing
topics
and
to
expose
students
to
these
topics
repeatedly
in
the
context
of
a
wide
variety
of
cs
courses
the
key
to
our
approach
is
the
development
of
a
required
intermediate-level
course
that
serves
as
an
introduction
to
computer
systems
and
parallel
computing
it
serves
as
a
requirement
for
every
cs
major
and
minor
and
is
a
prerequisite
to
upper-level
courses
that
expand
on
parallel
and
distributed
computing
topics
in
different
contexts
with
the
addition
of
this
new
course
we
are
able
to
easily
make
room
in
upper-level
courses
to
add
and
expand
parallel
and
distributed
computing
topics
the
goal
of
our
curricular
design
is
to
ensure
that
every
graduating
cs
major
has
exposure
to
parallel
and
distributed
computing
with
both
a
breadth
and
depth
of
coverage
our
curriculum
is
particularly
designed
for
the
constraints
of
a
small
liberal
arts
college
however
much
of
its
ideas
and
its
design
are
applicable
to
any
undergraduate
cs
curriculum
in
the
last
years
serious
games
have
been
successfully
exploited
in
different
areas
however
in
spite
of
the
powerful
tool
that
this
kind
of
video
games
has
proved
to
be
in
the
classroom
a
few
methodological
efforts
have
been
conducted
in
order
to
involve
pedagogues
or
educators
in
the
design
loop
of
these
games
or
one
step
further
include
students
in
the
co-design
process
to
promote
learning
through
design
as
a
context
with
this
objective
this
paper
presents
a
set
of
metamodels
that
could
facilitate
the
conceptual
design
of
this
type
of
games
to
this
end
a
complete
graphical
notation
based
on
the
uml
standard
with
adaptations
is
defined
for
representing
the
components
of
this
type
of
games
having
in
mind
to
improve
the
collaboration
between
the
team
of
educatorsstudents
and
the
technical
team
during
the
design
process
finally
the
design
diagrams
defined
during
the
production
of
a
specific
serious
game
titled
uranus
are
illustrated
in
order
to
show
the
feasibility
of
the
proposal
in
addition
a
validation
experience
was
conducted
with
educators
and
computer
engineering
students
in
order
to
test
the
value
of
the
proposed
graphic
notation
to
design
educational
games
researchers
have
explored
the
benefits
and
applications
of
virtual
reality
vr
in
different
scenarios
vr
possesses
much
potential
and
its
application
in
education
has
seen
much
research
interest
lately
however
little
systematic
work
currently
exists
on
how
researchers
have
applied
immersive
vr
for
higher_education
purposes
that
considers
the
usage
of
both
high-end
and
budget
head-mounted
displays
hmds
hence
we
propose
using
systematic
mapping
to
identify
design
elements
of
existing
research
dedicated
to
the
application
of
vr
in
higher_education
the
reviewed
articles
were
acquired
by
extracting
key
information
from
documents
indexed
in
four
scientific
digital
libraries
which
were
filtered
systematically
using
exclusion
inclusion
semi-automatic
and
manual
methods
our
review
emphasizes
three
key
points
the
current
domain
structure
in
terms
of
the
learning
contents
the
vr
design
elements
and
the
learning
theories
as
a
foundation
for
successful
vr-based
learning
the
mapping
was
conducted
between
application
domains
and
learning
contents
and
between
design
elements
and
learning
contents
our
analysis
has
uncovered
several
gaps
in
the
application
of
vr
in
the
higher_education
sphere—for
instance
learning
theories
were
not
often
considered
in
vr
application
development
to
assist
and
guide
toward
learning
outcomes
furthermore
the
evaluation
of
educational
vr
applications
has
primarily
focused
on
usability
of
the
vr
apps
instead
of
learning
outcomes
and
immersive
vr
has
mostly
been
a
part
of
experimental
and
development
work
rather
than
being
applied
regularly
in
actual
teaching
nevertheless
vr
seems
to
be
a
promising
sphere
as
this
study
identifies
18
application
domains
indicating
a
better
reception
of
this
technology
in
many
disciplines
the
identified
gaps
point
toward
unexplored
regions
of
vr
design
for
education
which
could
motivate
future
work
in
the
field
the
nsfieee-tcpp
parallel
and
distributed
computing
curriculum
guidelines
released
in
2012
pdc12
represents
an
effort
to
bring
more
parallel
computing
concepts
into
early
computer
science
courses
to
date
it
has
been
moderately
successful
with
the
inclusion
of
some
pdc
topics
in
the
acmieee
computer
science
curriculum
guidelines
in
2013
cs13
and
mentions
of
pdc
topics
in
the
computing
curricula
2020
additionally
some
universities
in
the
us
and
around
the
world
have
started
to
cover
some
of
these
topics
in
early
cs
courses
lack
of
knowledge
of
or
training
in
pdc
topics
among
instructors
along
with
the
need
to
align
early
cs
course
content
with
prescribed
learning
objectives
in
the
curricula
are
often
cited
as
hurdles
for
adoption
in
early
cs
courses
there
have
been
attempts
at
bringing
pdc
materials
such
as
textbook
chapters
lecture
slides
assignments
and
demos
to
assist
instructors
of
early
cs
classes
however
the
effort
required
on
the
part
of
the
instructor
to
figure
out
what
is
relevant
to
a
particular
class
can
be
daunting
in
this
work
we
contend
that
simultaneously
classifying
pedagogical
materials
against
the
cs13
and
the
pdc12
curriculum
guidelines
can
address
some
of
the
challenges
faced
by
instructors
and
can
promote
broader
adoption
of
pdc
materials
in
early
cs
courses
we
present
cs
materials
a
system
that
can
be
used
to
categorize
pedagogical
materials
according
to
well-known
and
established
curricular
guidelines
we
show
that
cs
materials
can
be
leveraged
1
by
instructors
of
early
cs
courses
to
find
materials
that
are
similar
to
the
one
that
they
use
but
that
also
cover
pdc
topics
and
2
by
instructors
to
check
the
coverage
of
topics
and
gaps
in
a
course
and
3
by
pdc
experts
to
identify
topics
for
which
pdc
instructional
materials
do
not
exist
or
are
insufficient
in
order
to
inform
development
of
additional
pdc
curricular
materials

this
paper
addresses
some
of
the
challenges
involved
in
implementing
the
new
approach
established
in
the
spanish
national
curriculum
in
2006
which
brought
as
a
major
change
a
focus
on
the
development
of
key
competencies
the
paper
focuses
on
scientific
competency
and
the
challenges
involved
in
the
itinerary
from
policy
documents
to

are
addressed
in
three
sections
i
an
analysis
is
made
of
the
changes
in
the
science
curriculum
as
a
consequence
of
the
emphasis
on
scientific
competency
comparing
the
assessment
criteria
in

previous
and
current
steering
documents
ii
trends
in
teacher
education
are
discussed
iii
the
findings
of
the
diagnostic
evaluation
are
analyzed
the
paper
is
framed
in
a
theoretical
approach
viewing
students’
participation
in
scientific
practices
and
the
development
of
higher-order
thinking
as
necessary
goals
of
science
education
we
argue
that
the
focus
on
competencies
characterized
as
the
ability
to
apply
knowledge
and
skills
in
new
contexts
involves
a
major
change
towards
knowledge
transfer
and
higher-order
thinking
skills
some
issues
emerging
from
the
analysis
relate
to
the
implications
of
assessment
criteria
and
the
challenges
involved
in
its
implementation
to
the
trends
in
teacher
professional
development
and
the
difficulties
related
to
the
current
economic
crisis
and
to
the
results
of
the
diagnostic
evaluation
and
time
frame
needed
for
reforms
to
have
an
impact
it
is
argued
that
the
development
of
both
competencies
and
higher-order
thinking
requires
students’
prolonged
engagement
this
study
investigated
the
perceptions
of
physical
sciences
physics
and
chemistry
teachers
on
the
implementation
of
inquiry-based_learning
at
a
diversity
of
high
schools
in
south
africa
the
findings
show
that
teachers
at
all
locations
of
school
have
a
positive
perception
of
inquiry-based_learning
with
benefits
for
learners
that
include
the
development
of
experimental
skills
and
making
science
more
enjoyable
however
with
regard
to
inquiry
facilitating
conceptual
understanding
teachers
at
township
and
rural
schools
believe
a
didactic
approach
to
be
more
effective
than
learners
doing
inquiry
whilst
teachers
at
suburban
and
urban
schools
favour
an
inquiry-based
approach
in
this
regard
the
significance
of
this
study
is
that
the
lack
of
resources
large
classes
and
the
limited
exposure
to
inquiry
of
learners
at
township
and
rural
schools
constrain
the
implementation
of
inquiry-based_learning
at
these
schools
and
result
in
teachers
at
such
schools
resorting
to
a
didactic
pedagogy

to
frame
the

drawing
on
that

we
present
a
co-creativity

specifically
focused
on
evaluating
the

we
argue
that
leveraging
whc
within
vles
broadens
perspectives
on
the
purposes
of

as
this
ethically
framed
creativity
foregrounds
the
role
of
values
in
generating
fundamental
small-scale
creative
change
through
‘journeys

that
have
the
potential

community
“big
data”
is
a
term
that
has
been
used
often
in
the
past
decade
to
describe
datasets
that
are
extremely
large
and
complex
so
that
traditional

is
unable
to
store
and
analyze
them
in
an
accurate
way
it
can
refer
to
“long

“wide

will
have

however
significant
challenges
remain
here
we
discuss
the
challenges
and
possible
solutions
posed
to
biomedical
research
by
our
increasing
ability
to
collect

important
challenges
include
1
the
need
for
standardization
of

content
format
and
clinical
definitions
adhering
to
the
fair
guiding
principles
2
the
need
for
collaborative

through
a

approach
3
stricter

and
4
a
need
to
reconsider
how

is
taught
to

overcoming
these
challenges
will

investigates
possibilities
of
implanting

graphically
depicts
the
potential
impact
of

the
findings
indicate
that
the
external

implantation
mode
may
actively
encourage
the
construction
of

has
benefits
in

autistic
children
are
thought
to
develop
social
attention
skills
differently
from
non-autistic
children
previous
work
has
shown
that
technology
and
specifically
tangible
toys
could
have
the
potential
to
support
social
attention
in
autistic
children
a
key
challenge
is
knowing
how
to
design
and
use
interactive
and
intelligent
technologies
to
support
interaction
in
autistic
children
given
the
heterogeneity
in
levels
of
social
motivation
social
development
and
interest
in
digital
technologies
to
address
this
challenge
we
examined
in
detail
the
interaction
between
digital
features
and
autistic
children’s
joint
engagement
in
a
real-world
setting
exploring
the
impact
of
tangible
constraints
in
fostering
social
interaction
the
current
study
observed
autistic
children
aged
between
12
and
15
years
playing
with
a
digital
robotic
toy
and
a
non-digital
counterpart
and
measured
social
attention
and
engagement
during
free
play
the
results
showed
that
increased
and
higher
levels
of
joint
attention
when
children
had
to
share
a
toy
between
them
on
both
digital
and
non-digital
interfaces
we
found
that
autistic
children
individually
vary
in
their
propensity
to
engage
in
social
interactions
as
well
as
their
responses
to
digital
features
this
work
contributes
to
a
growing
area
of
evidence
that
tangible
and
smart
technologies
can
create
social
opportunities
for
autistic
children

critical
analyses
of

education
ee
highlight
the
predominance
of
literatures
that
focus
closely
on
the
positive
aspects
of
entrepreneurship
this
can
lead
to
cognitive
bias
resulting
in
students
developing
more
favorable
and
even
enthusiastic
perceptions
of
entrepreneurial
action
to
reduce
this
information
asymmetry
the
intention
of
this
study
was
to
identify
and
classify
the
diversity
of
negative
aspects
resulting
from
unsuccessful
entrepreneurial
action
to
this
end
we
applied
the
content
analysis
technique
to
the
transcripts
of
interviews
with
former
entrepreneurs
and
stakeholders
associated
with
entrepreneurial
action
in
addition
to
the
texts
of
articles
from
important
journals
of
entrepreneurship
and
small

identified
through
a
scope
literature
review
the
findings
indicate
that
unsuccessful
entrepreneurial
action
can
result
in
several
negative
effects
for
the
entrepreneur
both
subjectively
psychological
and
social
aspects
-
dark
side
and
objectively
material
aspects
-
downside
the
study
also
identified
several
negative

in
the
three

known
as
“triple

a

was
developed
that
integrates
these
different

this

and
continuing

our
central
premise
is
that
the
trajectory
necessary
to
be
expert
in
the
emergent
fields
in

of
them
requires
acceleration
at
an
early

both

female

there
is
growing
diversity
in
the

of

where
once
all

learned
to

today
there
exists
a

to

relatively
little
work
has
explored
the
relationship
between
the
design
of
novice
programming
environments
and
the
programming
practices
they
engender
in
their
users
this
paper
seeks
to
shed
light
on
this
dimension
of
learning
to
program
through
the
careful
analysis
of
novice
programmers’
experiences
learning
with
a
hybrid
blocktext
programming
environment
specifically
this
paper
is
concerned
with
how
novices
leverage
the
various
affordances
designed
into
programming
environments
and
programming
languages
to
support
their
early
efforts
to
author
programs
we
explore
this
relationship
through
the
construct
of
modality
using
data
from
a
study
conducted
in
a
high_school
computer
science
classroom
in
which
students
spent
five
weeks
working
in
block-based
text-based
and
hybrid
blocktext
programming
environments
this
paper
uses
a
detailed
vignette
of
a
novice
writing
a
program
in
the
hybrid
environment
as
a
way
to
characterize
emerging
programming
practices
then
presents
analyses
of
programming
trends
from
the
full
study
population
to
speak
to
the
generality
of
the
practices
identified
in
the
vignette
the
analyses
focus
not
only
on
characterizing
authoring
strategies
but
also
on
identifying
patterns
in
novices’
help-seeking
behaviors
by
focusing
on
how
modality
influences
novices’
emerging
programming
practices
this
paper
contributes
to
our
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
programming
environment
and
learning
illuminating
the
role
of
design
in
shaping
introductory
programming
experiences
storytelling
support
has
been
and
continues
to
be
a
recurring
theme
in
child–computer
interaction
research
especially
as
it
pertains
to
education
this
work
has
spilled
over
into
practice
and
in
the
last
few
decades
a
large
number
of
storytelling
systems
for
children
have
been
developed—both
as
research
prototypes
and
commercial
applications
however
through
a
systematic
analysis
of
75
research-based
storytelling
systems
and
39
commercial
systems
we
find
that
there
remains
a
problematic
gap
between
research
and
practice
with
respect
to
products
in
interactive
storytelling
and
child–computer
interaction
echoing
the
well-documented
research-practice
gap
in
the
general
hci
field
we
characterize
the
nature
of
this
gap
highlighting
design
themes
promoted
by
research-based
systems
that
are
not
as
prevalent
in
commercial
systems
such
as
tangibility
and
narrative
scaffolds
and
vice-versa
understanding
the
main
areas
of
discrepancy
between
research
and

can
help
focus
efforts
to
close

social

but
we
know
relatively
little
about

compared
to

when
performing
a
social

experiment
in
which
a

and
a

were
used
for
teaching

the
main
goal
of
this
paper
is
not
to
analyze
the

obtained
in

performed
but
to
focus
on
the
students
attitudes

do
this
a

of
the
results
of
these
questionnaires
considers
differences
between
age
groups
and
students
lectured
by
a
robot
vs
a
human

we
conclude
that
age
is
the
main
factor
that
affects
students’
attitudes
towards
robots
although
we
also
found
other
differences
between
the

with
special
emphasis
on
the

we
present
a
detailed
examination
of
the
ihrmtm

from
its
inception
in
1965
through

this
study
investigates
the
development
of
transversal
skills
and
their
association
with
academic
performance
in
university
students
enrolled
in
on-campus
programs
with
online
activities
a
cross-sectional
descriptive
and
quantitative
research
was
conducted
with
252
students
from
a
public
university
in
mexico
transversal
skills
socioformative
project-based
practices
learning
strategies
and
the
relevance
of
online
activities
were
assessed
using
validated
rubrics
the
results
indicated
a
low
level
of
development
in
three
transversal
skills
research
entrepreneurship
and
english
with
the
latter
being
the
poorest
rated
critical

exhibited
the
highest
level
of

in
the
didactic
component
socioformative
project-based
pedagogical
practices
and
learning
strategies
showed
acceptable
levels
students
expressed
satisfaction
with
complementary
online
activities
showing
a
preference
for
interactive

under
4
min
regression
analysis
and
structural
equations
were
used
to
examine
the
relationships
between
various

results
demonstrated
that
socioformative
project-based
pedagogical
practices
learning
strategies
and
online
education
positively
correlated
with
the
development
of
transversal
skills
furthermore
a
higher
level
of
transversal
skills
was
associated
with
better
academic
averages
among
students
socioformative
project-based
pedagogical
practices
also
correlated
with
academic
performance
through
transversal

the
study
concludes
that
integrating
online
activities
into
on-campus
programs
based
on
the
socioformative
pedagogical
model
can
enhance
the
development
of
transversal
skills
and
improve
academic

further
research
into
the
implementation
of
this
educational
model
and
its
long-term
impact
on
university
education
and
professional
success
is
recommended
the
learning
process
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
learning
environment
particularly
in
the
case
of
open-ended
learning
environments
where
the
learning
process
is
considered
to
be
non-linear
in
this
paper
we
report
on
the
findings
of
employing
a
multimodal
hidden
markov
model
hmm
based
methodology
to
investigate
the
temporal
learning
processes
of
two
types
of
learners
that
have
learning
gains
and
a
type
that
does
not
have
learning
gains
in
an
open-ended
collaborative_learning
activity
considering
log
data
speech
behavior
affective
states
and
gaze
patterns
we
find
that
all
learners
start
from
a
similar
state
of
non-productivity
but
once
out
of
it
they
are
unlikely
to
fall
back
into
that
state
especially
in
the
case
of
the
learners
that
have
learning
gains
those
who
have
learning
gains
shift
between
two
problem_solving
strategies
each
characterized
by
both
exploratory
and
reflective
actions
as
well
as
demonstrate
speech
and
gaze
patterns
associated
with
these
strategies
that
differ
from
those
who
dont
have
learning
gains
further
the
teams
that
have
learning
gains
also
differ
between
themselves
in
the
manner
in
which
they
employ
the
problem_solving
strategies
over
the
interaction
as
well
as
in
the
manner
they
express
negative
emotions
while
exhibiting
a
particular
strategy
these
outcomes
contribute
to
understanding
the
multiple
pathways
of
learning
in
an
open-ended
collaborative_learning
environment
and
provide
actionable
insights
for
designing
effective
interventions
to
support
english

els
in
attaining
rigorous
content
standards
us
federal
legislation
requires
that
english
language
proficiency
elp
standards
align
with
content
standards
whereas
language
use
in
content
learning
has
traditionally
been
defined
in
terms
of
structure
content
and
language
educators
have
devoted
increased
attention
to
precision
precision
goes
beyond
the
structural
elements
of
language
to
the
disciplinary
meaning
that
those
elements
communicate
in
this
article
we
define
precision
and
distinguish
it
from
vocabulary
accuracy
and
complexity
then
we
highlight
divergent
conceptions
of
precision
in
content
standards
and
elp
standards
in
light
of
these
divergent
conceptions
we
present
work
samples
from
an
elementary

classroom
to
illustrate
how
precision
of
disciplinary
meaning
is
essential
to
engaging
in

we
close

mangrove
forests
grow
in
the
estuaries
of
124
tropical
countries
around
the
world
because
in-situ
monitoring
of
mangroves
is
difficult
and
time-consuming
remote
sensing
technologies
are
commonly
used
to
monitor
these
ecosystems
landsat
satellites
have
provided
regular
and
systematic
images
of
mangrove
ecosystems
for
over
30
years
yet
researchers
often
cite
budget
and
infrastructure
constraints
to
justify
the
underuse
this
resource
since
2001
over
50
studies
have
used
landsat
or
aster
imagery
for
mangrove
monitoring
and
most
focus
on
the
spatial
extent
of
mangroves
rarely
using
more
than
five
images
even
after
the
landsat
archive
was
made
free
for
public
use
few
studies
used
more
than
five
images
despite
the
clear
advantages
of
using
more
images
eg
lower
signal-to-noise
ratios
the
main
argument
of
this
paper
is
that
with
freely
available
imagery
and
high
performance
computing
facilities
around
the
world
it
is
up
to
researchers
to
acquire
the
necessary
programming
skills
to
use
these
resources
programming
skills
allow
researchers
to
automate
repetitive
and
time-consuming
tasks
such
as
image
acquisition
and
processing
consequently
reducing
up
to
60
of
the
time
dedicated
to
these
activities
these
skills
also
help
scientists
to
review
and
re-use
algorithms
hence
making
mangrove
research
more
agile
this
paper
contributes
to
the
debate
on
why
scientists
need
to
learn
to
program
not
only
to
challenge
prevailing
approaches
to
mangrove
research
but
also
to
expand
the
temporal
and
spatial
extents
that
are
commonly
used
for
mangrove

biodesign
a
speculative
and
creative
offshoot
from
the
field
of
bioengineering
is
an
area
of
stem
that
is
growing
in
popularity
in
education
settings
primarily
because
of
its
unique
interdisciplinary
lens
that
connects
stem
disciplinary
knowledge
and
creative
design
practices
although
this
trend
is
currently
limited
to
middle
school
high_school
and
higher_education
prior
research
suggests
that
children
5
years
and
older
may
yield
long-term
gains
from
exploring
developmentally-appropriate
concepts
from
novel
stem
fields
although
there
is
little
research
on
educational
technologies
or
resources
to
support
young
children’s
curiosity
and
learning
in
this
novel
domain
some
research
suggests
that
young
children
may
already
be
forming
preconceptions
about
genetics
and
biology
eg
from
popular
media
tangible
technologies
which
provide
children
qualitatively
new
developmentally
appropriate
ways
to
engage
with
ideas
and
techniques
have
been
shown
to
support
children’s
engagement
with
foundational
ideas
relevant
to
biodesign
including
the
engineering
design
process
by
applying
developmentally
appropriate
constraints
to
our
technology
development
eg
through
frameworks
such
as
the
positive
technological
development
the
research
team
developed
and
evaluated
a
novel
tangible
technology
called
crispee
to
introduce
young
children
to
concepts
of
biology
and
engineering
this
article
describes
an
experimental
pilot
study
to
investigate
1
how
young
children
interact
with
the
crispee
technological
prototype
and
2
what
prior
knowledge
the
average
child
might
bring
to
an
educational
biodesign
activity
implications
for
ongoing
technology
development
and
developmentally
appropriate
learning
goals
are
discussed
size
and
scale
cognition
is
a
critical
aptitude
associated
with
reasoning
with
concepts
and
systems
in
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem
however
the
teaching
and
learning
of
concepts
related
to
size
and
scale
present
major
challenges
because
objects
at
certain
scales
are
unable
to
be
perceived
by
humans
with
the
naked
eye
a
potential
way
to
overcome
this
challenge
could
be
by
means
of
learning
strategies
coupled
with
multimedia
learning
in
this
study
we
propose
learning
strategies
instantiated
by
multimedia
are
for
learning
tools
that
may
result
in
improved
learning
of
size
and
scale
cognition
based
on
the
fs2c
framework
this
framework
consists
of
five
levels
to
characterize
size
and
scale
cognition
and
the
cognitive
processes
supporting
them
participants
of
this
quasi-experimental
design
included
224
undergraduate
students
who
experienced
one
of
three
different
multimedia
for
learning
tools
and
then
were
assessed
through
five
tasks
whose
design
was
based
on
the
fs2c
framework
results
suggest
that
learning
strategies
prompting
students
to
compare
objects
of
different
sizes
may
increase
their
abilities
in
ordering
and
classifying
objects
having
students
to
interact
with
a
logarithmic
scale
may
also
have
increased
participant
posttest
performance
scores
in
the
numerical
proportional
and
absolute
measurement
tasks
finally
we
propose
that
the
use
of
multimedia
for
learning
affordances
like
3d
interaction
zoom
in
and
zoom
out
and
direct
interaction
with
a
scale
metaphor
may
help
students
make
explicit
connections
and
become
familiar
with
objects
of
different
sizes
and
scales

three
key

were
identified
during

lack
of
cross-disciplinary
understanding
variability
in
recipients’
technology
access
infrastructure
and
literacy
and
the
idea
that
evidence-based
in-person
interactions
do
not
translate
directly
to
digital
interactions
interviewees
identified
several
key
considerations
that
interventionists
learned
to
prioritize
which
have
the
potential
to
overcome
these
barriers
and
lead
to
successful
interventions
conclusions
barriers
in
the
development
of
digital
behavioral
interventions
are
often
created
by
a
lack
of
cross-disciplinary
understanding
which
can
lead
to
difficulties
conceptualizing
interventions
unrealistic
expectations
in

of
cost
and
confusion
about
the
development
process
moreover
concerns
about
research

participant
characteristics
and
access
to

as
the
translation
of

are
apparent
appropriate

creators
overcome
these
barriers
and
may
lead
to

innovations
in

tendencies
in

suggest
a
move
away
from

building
on
core
values
of

we
introduce
three
dimensions
of

that
we
argue
can
be
essential

stress
the
importance
of

in
addition
we
found
that

differed
significantly
in

limitations
particularly
the
narrow
focus
on
specific

and
lack
of

this
study
aims
to
advocate
that
a
visual
programming
environment
offering
graphical
items
and
states
of
a
computational
problem
could
be
helpful
in
supporting
programming
learning
with

a
visual
problem-solving
environment
for
programming
learning
was
developed
and
158
college
students
were
conducted
in
a
computational
problem-solving
activity
the
students
activities
of
designing

were
recorded
by

analysis
to
initially
unveil
the

were
identified
furthermore
comparisons

among
the
different

were
conducted
considering
the

evidence-based

are
discussed
effects
of
multiple
external
representations
on
teaching
and

have
been
widely
researched
however
relatively
little
is
understood
about
how
different
types
of
representations
used
for
item
presentation
influence
students
performances
in
computer-based
assessments
particularly
in
those
evaluating
complex
abilities
we
designed
a
multimedia-based
assessment
for
secondary_school
students
that
focused
on
scientific
inquiry
abilities
ie
questioning
experimenting
analyzing
and
explaining
through
the
participation
of
1218
students
561
8th

and
657
11th

the
balanced
arrangement
of
test
booklets
and
the
use
of
a
generalized
partial
credit
rasch
model
this
study
aimed
at
investigating
how
the
modality
of
representations
for
item
presentation
ie
dynamic
and
static
and
type
of
visual
information
ie
context
and
content
conveyed
by
the
representations
affected
the
item
difficulty
of
the
multimedia-based
assessment
the
results
showed
that
overall
items
became
slightly
more
difficult
for
students
when
the
item
presentation
was
static
also
the
interaction
effect
between
modality
and
grade
was
significant
when
item
presentation
was
changed
from
dynamic
to
static
the
items
became
easier
to
the
8th
graders
whereas
they
were
more
difficult
to
the
11th
graders
the
results
suggested
that
older
students
might
have
more
cognitive
resources
to
retrieve
information
from
dynamic
displays
to
solve
the
assessment
tasks
successfully
additionally
while
all
interactions
between
modality
and
type
of
information
on
items
with
context
visuals
were
not
significant
there
were
significant
interactions
on
four
items
with
content
visuals
a
further
examination
of
the
items
suggested
that
the
tasks
and
the
phenomena
involved
in
the
items
may
influence
how
modality
affected
the
item
difficulties
when
content
visuals
were
used
these
results
implied
that
researchers
need
to
pay
special
attention
on
the
design
of
content
visuals
because
they
appear
to
be
more
influential
than
context
ones
to
students
performances
of
science
assessments
we
conducted
a
mixed-methods
systematic

to
unpack

about

findings
revealed
that
equitable

was
conceptualized
as

perspective
2
attending

3
empowering

effects
arise
from
competition
for
access
via
a
shared
retrieval
cue
this
notion
is
sufficiently
general
that
it
may
be
applied
in
a
variety
of
interference
settings
which
is
illustrated
briefly
then
the
classical
interference
paradigms
from
which
these
ideas
emerged
are
reviewed
the
chapter
also
reviews
more
recent
phenomena
that
both
support
and
challenge
classical
conceptions
of
interference
these
phenomena
provide
compelling
illustrations
of
the
generality
of
interference
and
consequently
of
the
importance
of
understanding
its
mechanisms
a
recent
perspective
on
interference
is
highlighted
that
builds
upon
insights
from
modern
work
while
validating
intuitions
underlying
several
of
the
classical
interference
mechanisms
according
to
this
new
perspective
forgetting
derives
not
from
acquiring
new
memories
per
se
but
from
the
impact
of
later
retrievals
of
the
newly
learned
material
after
discussing
findings
from
several
paradigms
that
support
this
retrieval-based
view
the
chapter
illustrates
how
forgetting
might
be
linked
to
inhibitory
processes
underlying
selective
attention
since
its
launch
in
2016
pokémon
go
has
attracted
huge
numbers
of
players
causing
a
boom
in
this
game
market
although
it
is
not
as
popular
as
before
from
time
to
time
we
still
find
crowds
of
players
gathered
in
some
spots
where
pokémon
appear
numerous
reports
have
explored
this
pokémon
phenomenon
however
the
exact
reasons
for
its
popularity
remain
unknown
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
explore
the
post-adoption
behavior
of
pokémon
go
players
and
its
influential
factors
in
the
gaming
and
tourism
industries
the
theoretical
model
of
stimulus-organism-response
was
drawn
on
to
examine
the
impact
of
the
environmental
stimuli
social
influence
and
media
influence
on
players’
internal
organisms
which
in
turn
affect
their
post-experience
responses
moreover
gender
differences
were
also
examined
in
the
hypothetical
relationships
a
total
of
342
valid
questionnaires
from
actual
gamers
were
collected
in
this
study
and
data
analysis
was
performed
using
a
structural_equation_model
the
results
show
that
stimulus
effects
such
as
social
stimuli
critical
mass
and
social
interaction
and
media
stimuli
content
timeliness
and
media
richness
have
significant
impacts
on
the
players’
internal
gamified
experience
attachment
and
conformity
which
in
turn
affect
their
visit
intention
to
catch
creatures
at
certain
attractions
and
to
continue
playing
pokémon
go
further
we
have
also
found
that
players’
intention
to
visit
pokémon
spots
is
significantly
correlated
with
their
intention
to
continue
playing
the
game
findings
provide
links
between
gamification
and
tourism
literature
further
theoretical
and
managerial
implications
are
provided
in
this
experiment
we
will
study
the
impact
of
light
pollution
on
the
activity
and
foraging
behaviors
using
madagascar
hissing
cockroaches
as
the
model
system
you
will
develop
your

provided
you
will
then
test
your
hypotheses
evaluate
the
results
of
your
experiment
and
revise
and
retest
your

aims
to
conduct
a

we
analyzed
45

and
clarified
the

there
was
a
lack
of

is
the
result
of
an
afterthought
using
amongst

principles
from

to
rethink
techniques
and
knowledge
of
several
areas
of

the
aim
is

before
explaining
what
cognitive
analysis
is
i
will
tell
you
how
the
history
of
calculation
since
5000
years
may
be
seen
as
a
successful
stab
at
understanding
formalizing
and
automating
human
processing
of

which
is
where
computer
science
and
psychology
meet
then
i
will
demonstrate
that
a
new
behavioralism
based
on
digital
and
classical
behavior
and
specific
areas
of
the
brain
is
starting
to
emerge
and
produces
psychological
models
that
are
used
to
know
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
people
observed
to
better
sell

stuff
and
predict

this

methodological
paper
is
proposing
a
theoretical

x
framework
that
emerged
from
the
empirical
findings
of
implementing
transdisciplinary
steam
practices
featuring

this
paper
shows
how
the
proposed
steam
practices
involving
creativities
to
promote
the
integration
of
various
disciplines
with
multiple
cross-cultural
iterations
these
steam

allow

to
integrate

this

introduces
the

seven
decades
ago
the
russian
physiologist
and
movement
scientist
nikolai
a
bernstein
proposed
a
hierarchical
model
to
explain
the
construction
of
movements
in
his
model
the
levels
of
the
hierarchy
share
a
common
language
ie
they
are
commensurate
and
perform
complementing
functions
to
bring
about
dexterous
movements
the
science
of
the
control
and
coordination
of
movement
in
the
phylum
craniata
has
made
considerable
progress
in
the
intervening
seven
decades
the
contemporary
body
of
knowledge
about
each
of
bernstein’s
hypothesized
functional
levels
is
both
more
detailed
and
more
sophisticated
a
natural
consequence
of
this
progress
however
is
the
relatively
independent
theoretical
development
of
a
given
level
from
the
other
levels
in
this
essay
we
revisit
each
level
of
bernstein’s
hierarchy
from
the
joint
perspectives
of
a
the
ecological
approach
to
perception-action
and
b
dynamical

theory
we
review
a
substantial
and
relevant
body
of

produced
in
different
areas
of

that
are
accommodated
by
this
ecological-dynamical
version
of
bernstein’s
levels
implications
for
the
control

here
we
present
robust

from
a

based
on
the

we
conclude
with
recommendations

also
shown
arousing

however
despite
this
emerging
interest
the

has
remained
quite
silent
about
the
potential
of
a

and
identifies

that
are

the
robot
operating
system
offers
a
core
set
of
software
for
operating
robots
that
can
be
extended
by
creating
or
using
existing
packages
making
it
possible
to
write
robotic
software
that
can
be
reused
on
different
hardware
platforms
with
thousands
of
packages
available
per
stable

encapsulating
algorithms
sensor

etc
it
is
the
de

middleware
for
robotics
like
any
software
ecosystem
ros

evolve
in
order
to
keep
meeting
the
requirements
of
its
users
in

packages
may
end
up
being
abandoned
between

no
one
may
be
available

as
such
we
wanted
to
identify
and
understand
the
evolution
challenges
faced
by
the
ros
ecosystem
in
this
article
we
report
our
findings
after
interviewing
19
ros
developers
in
depth
followed
by
a
focus
group
4
participants
and
an
online
survey
of
119
ros
community
members
we
specifically
focused
on
the
issues
surrounding
package
reuse
and
how
to
contribute
to
existing
packages
to
conclude
we
discuss
the
implications
of
our
findings
and
propose
five
recommendations
for
overcoming
the
identified
issues
with
the
goal
of
improving
the
health
of
the
ros
ecosystem
the
“problem
of
serial
order
in
behavior”
as
formulated
and
discussed
by
lashley
1951
is
arguably
more
pervasive
and
more
profound
both
than
originally
stated
and
than
currently
appreciated
we
spell
out
two
complementary
aspects
of
what
we
term
the
generalized
problem
of
behavior
i
multimodality
stemming
from
the
disparate
nature
of
the
sensorimotor
variables
and
processes
that
underlie
behavior
and
ii
concurrency
which
reflects
the
parallel
unfolding
in
time
of
these
processes
and
of
their
asynchronous
interactions
we
illustrate
these
on
a
number
of
examples
with
a
special
focus
on
language
briefly
survey
the
computational
approaches
to
multimodal
concurrency
offer
some
hypotheses
regarding
the
manner
in
which
brains
address
it
and
discuss
some
of
the
broader
implications
of
these
as
yet
unresolved
issues
for
cognitive
science
in
the
past
two
decades
we
have
witnessed
soaring
efforts
in
applying
augmented
reality
ar
technology
in
education
several
systematic
literature
reviews
slrs
were
conducted
to
study
ar
educational
applications
areas
and
associated
methodologies
primarily
from
the
pedagogical
rather
than
from
the
human–computer
interaction
hci
perspective
these
reviews
vary
in
goal
scale
scope
technique
outcome
and
quality
to
bridge
the
gaps
identified
in
these
slrs
ours
is
to
meet
fourfold
objectives
to
ground
the
analysis
deeper
in
the
usability
and

experience
ux
core
concepts
and
methods
to
study
the

effect
and
usabilityux
of

and
their
relations
by
learner
age
to
reflect
on
the
prevailing
slr
process
and
propose
improvement
to
draw
implications
for
the
future
development
of
areas
our
searches
in
four
databases
returned
714
papers
of
which
42
together
with
7
from
three
existing
slrs
were
included
in
the
final
analysis
several
intriguing
findings
have
been
identified
i
the
insufficient
grounding
in
usabilityux
frameworks
indicates
that
there
seems
a
disconnection
between
the
hci
and
technology-enhanced_learning
community
ii
a
lack
of
innovative
ar-specific
usabilityux
evaluation
methods
and
the
continuing
reliance
on
questionnaire
may
hamper
the
advances
of
areas
iii
the
learner
age
seems
not
a
significant
factor
in
determining
the
perceived
usability
and
ux
or
the
learning
effect
of
areas
iv
a
limited
number
of
studies
at
home
suggests
the
missed
opportunity
of
mobilizing
parents
to
support
children
to
deploy
areas
in
different
settings
v
the
number
of
areas
for
children
with
special
needs
remains
disappointedly
low
vi
the
threat
of
predatory
journals
to
the
quality
of
bibliometric
sources
amplifies
the
need
for
a
robust
approach
to
the
quality
assessment
for
slr
and
transparency
of
interim
results
implications
of
these
issues
for
future
research
and
practice
on
areas
are
drawn
the
main
aim
of
this
study
is
to
investigate
human
understanding
of
process
models

this

attempts
to
address
specific
deductive
reasoning
difficulties
based
on
process

the
authors
developed
a
research
model
to
capture
the
influence
of
two
effects
on
the
cognitive
difficulty
of
reasoning
tasks
i
the
presence
of
different
control-flow
patterns
such
as
conditional
or
parallel
execution
in
a
process
model
and
ii
the
interactivity
of
model
elements
based
on
solutions
to
61
different
reasoning
tasks
by
155
modelers
the
results
from
this
study
indicate
that
the
presence
of
certain
control-flow
patterns
influences
the
cognitive
difficulty
of
reasoning
tasks
in
particular
sequence
is
relatively
easy
while
loops
in
a
model
proved
difficult
modelers
with
higher
process
modeling
knowledge
performed
better
and
rated
subjective
difficulty
of

lower
than
modelers
with

the
findings
additionally
support
the
prediction
that
interactivity
between
model
elements
is
positively
related
to
the
cognitive
difficulty
of
reasoning
our
research
contributes
to
both
academic
literature
on
the
comprehension
of

models
and
practitioner
literature
focusing
on
cognitive
difficulties
when
using

human
activities
have
extensively
altered

throughout
the
world
and
further
changes
are

in
the
future
anthropogenic
impacts
such
as
land
use

groundwater
extraction
and
dam
construction
along
with
the
effects
of
climate
change
interact
with
natural
factors
including
soil
weathering
and
erosion
together
these
processes
create
a
constantly
shifting
dynamic
terrestrial
environment
that
violates
the
assumption
of
stationarity
commonly
applied
in
hydrology
consequently
hydrologists
need
to
rethink
both
statistical
and
calibrated
models
to
account
for
complex
environmental
processes
we
review
the
literature
on
human-landscape-hydrological
interactions
to
identify
processes
and
feedbacks
that
influence
water
balances
most
of
the
papers
covered
consider
only
a
few
of
these
processes
at
a
time
and
focus
on
structural
attributes
of
the
interactions
rather
than
the
short
and
long-term

we
identify
challenges
in
representing
the
scale-dependence

and
human-water

that
characterize

a

a
case

explores
how
different
processes
could
combine
to
drive
long-term
shifts
in

behavior
recognizing
that
some
important
questions
remain
unaddressed
by
traditional
approaches
we
suggest
the
concept
of
‘big

in
which
multifaceted
experiments
are
conducted
in
the
environment
by
artificially
inducing

these

would
be
accompanied
by
mechanistic
modeling
to
both
untangle

and
improve
the

an

plain
language
summary
the
earth’s
surface
is
constantly
changing
due
to
human-driven
and
natural
processes
shifts
may
be
driven
by
humans
directly
eg
via
land
use
change
or
indirectly
eg
by
driving
climate
change
that
causes
shifts
in
ecological
communities
other
changes
are
natural
such
as
certain
soil
processes
that
lead
to
shifts
in
texture
and
properties
over
time
in
many
places
landscape
change
is
now
occurring
at
unprecedented
rates
this
impacts
the
water
cycle
creating
a
need
for
models
that
are
robust
under
changing
conditions
our
paper
synthesizes
a
wide
range
of
literature
on
key
aspects
of
landscape
change
that
have
wide-ranging
implications
for
hydrology
we
focus
on
the
impacts
of
processes
at
different
spatial
and
temporal
scales
along
with
feedbacks
between
various
environmental
and
anthropogenic
shifts
we
discuss
connections
between
different
landscape
changes
and
the
timescales
over
which
they
each
affect
the
water
cycle
a
case
study
is
presented
to
highlight
the
potential
for
cascading
landscape
disturbances
that
could
alter
long-term
catchment
response
recognizing
limitations
in
traditional
data
collection
and
modeling
we
introduce
the
concept
of
‘big
laboratories’
to
conduct
environmental
experiments
under
landscape
change
providing
an
avenue
for
addressing
the
complex
questions
around
hydrology
in
a
changing
world
mirror
neurons
for
manipulation
fire
both
when
the
animal
manipulates
an
object
in
a
specific
way
and
when
it
sees
another
animal
or
the
experimenter
perform
an
action
that
is
more
or
less
similar
such
neurons
were
originally
found
in
macaque
monkeys
in
the
ventral
premotor
cortex
area
f5
and
later
also
in
the
inferior
parietal
lobule
recent
neuroimaging
data
indicate
that
the
adult
human
brain
is
endowed
with
a
“mirror
neuron
system”
putatively
containing
mirror
neurons
and
other
neurons
for
matching
the
observation
and
execution
of
actions
mirror
neurons
may
serve
action
recognition
in
monkeys
as
well
as
humans
whereas
their
putative
role
in
imitation
and
language
may
be
realized
in
human
but
not
in
monkey
this
article
shows
the
important
role
of
computational
models
in
providing
sufficient
and
causal
explanations
for
the
observed
phenomena
involving
mirror
systems
and
the
learning
processes
which
form
them
and
underlines
the
need
for
additional
circuitry
to
lift
up
the
monkey
mirror
neuron
circuit
to
sustain
the
posited
cognitive
functions
attributed
to
the
human
mirror
neuron
system
our
main
models
of
computation
the
turing
machine
and
the
ram
and
most
modern
computer
architectures
make
fundamental
assumptions
about
which
primitive
operations
are
realizable
on
a
physical
computing
device
the
consensus
is
that
these
primitive
operations
include
logical
operations
like
conjunction
disjunction
and
negation
as
well
as
reading
and
writing
to
a
large
collection
of
memory
locations
this
perspective
conforms
to
a
macro-level
view
of
physics
and
indeed
these
operations
are
realizable
using
macro-level
devices
involving
thousands
of
electrons
this
point
of
view
is
however
incompatible
with
computation
realized
using
quantum
devices
or
analyzed
using
elementary
thermodynamics
as
both
these
fundamental
physical
theories
imply
that
information
is
a
conserved
quantity
of
physical
processes
and
hence
of
primitive
computational
operations
our
aim
is
to
redevelop
foundational
computational
models
in
a
way
that
embraces
the
principle
of
conservation
of
information
we
first
define
what
information
is
and
what
its
conservation
means
in
a
computational
setting
we
emphasize
the
idea
that
computations
must
be
reversible
transformations
on
data
one
can
think
of
data
as
modeled
using
topological
spaces
and
programs
as
modeled
by
reversible
deformations
of
these
spaces
we
then
illustrate
this
idea
using
three
notions
of
data
and
their
associated
reversible
computational
models
the
first
instance
only
assumes
unstructured
finite
data
ie
discrete
topological
spaces
the
corresponding
notion
of
reversible
computation
is
that
of
permutations
we
show
how
this
simple
model
subsumes
conventional
computations
on
finite
sets
we
then
consider
a
modern
structured
notion
of
data
based
on
the
curry–howard
correspondence
between
logic
and
type
theory
we
develop
the
corresponding
notion
of
reversible
deformations
using
a
sound
and
complete
programming
language
for
witnessing
type
isomorphisms
and
proof
terms
for
commutative
semirings
we
then
“move
up
a
level”
to
examine
spaces
that
treat
programs
as
data
which
is
a
crucial
notion
for
any
universal
model
of
computation
to
derive
the
corresponding
notion
of
reversible
programs
between
programs
ie
reversible
program
equivalences
we
look
at
the
“higher
dimensional”
analog
to
commutative
semirings
symmetric
rig
groupoids
the
coherence
laws
for
these
groupoids
turn
out
to
be
exactly
the
sound
and
complete
reversible
program
equivalences
we
seek
we
conclude
with
some
possible
generalizations
inspired
by
homotopy
type
theory
and
survey
several
open
directions
for
further
research
various
types
of
chronotopologic

are
presented

as

are
reviewed

are

the

of

are

this
chapter
presents
an
ecosystem-based
framework
for
applying
soil
microbiology
ecology
and
biochemistry
smeb
principles
and
processes
to
address
the
preservation
and
sustainability
of
global
soils
to
meet
societal
needs
in
the
face
of
environmental
change
the
approach
is
organized
around
the
un
sustainable
development
goals
focusing
on
ecosystem
services
provided
by
soil
microbes
and
soil
biota
at
the
nexus
of
food
water
and
energy
the
role
of
soil
biota
in
ecosystem
processes
and
the
impacts
of
human
activities
on
those
processes
are
presented
the
approach
promotes
conservation
and
regenerative
methods
that
manage
natural
smeb
processes
to
optimize
ecosystem
services
and
minimize
alterations
in
natural
processes
adoption
and
application
of
sound
smeb
science
will
require
a
high
degree
of
literacy
among
different
stakeholders
to
codevelop
management
practices
and
regulatory
policy
the
approach
also
advocates
promoting
smeb
science
literacy
within
the
education
system
through
reforms
in
science
standards
and
curricula
we
present
a
contextualist
statistical
realistic
model
for
quantum-like
representations
in
physics
cognitive
science
and
psychology
we
apply
this
model
to
describe
cognitive
experiments
to
check
quantum-like
structures
of
mental
processes
the
crucial
role
is
played
by
interference
of
probabilities
for
mental
observables
recently
one
such
experiment
based
on
recognition
of
images
was
performed
this
experiment
confirmed
our
prediction
on
the
quantum-like
behavior
of
mind
in
our
approach
“quantumness
of
mind”
has
no
direct
relation
to
the
fact
that
the
brain
as
any
physical
body
is
composed
of
quantum
particles
we
invented
a
new
terminology
“quantum-like
ql
mind”
cognitive
ql-behavior
is
characterized
by
a
nonzero
coefficient
of
interference
λ
this
coefficient
can
be
found
on
the
basis
of
statistical
data
there
are
predicted
not
only
cos⁡θ-interference
of
probabilities
but
also
hyperbolic
cosh⁡θ-interference
this
interference
was
never
observed
for
physical
systems
but
we
could
not
exclude
this
possibility
for
cognitive
systems
we
propose
a
model
of
brain
functioning
as
a
ql-computer
there
is
a
discussion
on
the
difference
between
quantum
and
ql
computers
describes
the
outlines
of
a
computational
explication
of
the
belief–desire
theory
of
emotion
a
variant
of
cognitive
emotion
theory
according
to
the
proposed
explication
a
core
subset
of
emotions
including
surprise
are
nonconceptual
products
of
hardwired
mechanisms
whose
primary
function
is
to
subserve
the
monitoring
and
updating
of
the
central
representational
system
of
humans
the
belief–desire
system
the
posited
emotion-producing
mechanisms
are
analogous
to
sensory
transducers
however
instead
of
sensing
the
world
they
sense
the
state
of
the
belief–desire
system
and
signal
important
changes
in
this
system
in
particular
the
fulfillment
and
frustration
of
desires
and
the
confirmation
and
disconfirmation
of
beliefs
because
emotions
represent
this
information
about
the
state
of
the
representational
system
in
a
nonconceptual
format
emotions
are
nonconceptual
metarepresentations
it
is
argued
that
this
theory
of
emotions
provides
for
a
deepened
understanding
of
the
role
of
emotions
in
cognitive
systems
and
solves
several
problems
of
psychological
emotion
theory
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
growing
research
interest
towards
exploring
the
benefit
of
child–robot
interaction
for
educational
purposes
through
the
use
of
social
robotics
despite
the
label
such
robots
are
typically
only
social
within
scripted
activities
the
current
study
takes
a
critical
look
at
the
case
of
a
robotic
tutor
which
was
implemented
in
an
elementary_school
for
35
months
where
children
repeatedly
took
turns
interacting
with
the
robot
individually
as
well
as
in
pairs
the
aim
of
the
study
was
to
explore
what
caused
breakdowns
in
childrens
interactions
with
the
robotic
tutor
in
this
qualitative
study
over
14
h
of
video
recordings
of
childrens
interaction
sessions
were
analyzed
in-depth
through
interaction
analysis
and
thematic
analysis
the
results
comprise
four
themes
to
explain
why
childrens
interactions
with
the
robotic
tutor
break
down
1
the
robots
inability
to
evoke
initial
engagement
and
identify
misunderstandings
2
confusing
scaffolding
3
lack
of
consistency
and
fairness
and
finally
4
controller
problems
the
implications
of
these
breakdowns
for
the
educational
use
of
robots
are
discussed
and
it
is
concluded
that
several
challenges
need
to
be
rigorously
addressed
in
order
for
robotic
tutors
to
be
able
to
feature
in
education
as
a
novel
computational
approach
ubiquitous
computing
was
emerging
at
the
beginning
of
the
1980s
and
has
reached
a
rather
mature
level
by
now
it
assumes
that
computing
can
be
available
anywhere
anytime
and
in
any
context
due
to
technological
developments
social
demands
and
calm
implementations
over
the
years
the
opportunities
of
this
computing
paradigm
have
been
explored
and
the
benefits
have
been
exploited
successfully
in
many
application
fields
this
survey
paper
addresses
ubiquitous
computing
from
the
perspective
of
enabling
computer
aided
design
the
specific
objectives
of
the
reported
survey
are
to
i
give
an
overall
account
of
the
current
status
of
ubiquitous
computing
and
technologies
ii
cast
light
on
how
ubiquitous
computing
has
influenced
the
development
of
cad
systems
tools
and
methods
and
iii
critically
investigate
future
development
opportunities
of
ubiquitous
computing
enabled
computer
aided
design
first
the
paper
discusses
the
principles
and
typical
technologies
of
ubiquitous
computing
then
the
development
and
spectrum
of
the
so-called
standard
computer
aided
design
tasks
are
analyzed
from
a
computational
point
of
view
afterwards
the
already
implemented
design
enabling
functionalities
are
discussed
and
some
additional
functional
possibilities
are
considered
the
literature
provides
evidence
that
ubiquitous
computing
has
not
managed
to
revolutionize
the
methodologies
or
the
systems
of
computer
aided
design
so
far
though
many
researchers
intensively
studied
the
affordances
and
the
application
possibilities
of
ubiquitous
technologies
one
reason
is
that
ubiquitous
computing
technologies
had
in
the
last
two
decades
to
compete
with
other
kinds
of
computational
technologies
such
as
high-capacity
computing
high-speed
networking
immersive
virtual
reality
knowledge
ontologies
smart
software
agents
mobile
communication
etc
which
had
a
much
stronger
influence
on
the
development
of
computer
aided
design
methods
and
systems
in
combination
with
the
rather
conservative
and
conventionalist
industrial
practice
of
cad
system
development
and
application
this
may
explain
why
the
ubiquitous
computing
revolution
remained
weak
in
computer
aided
design
the
literature
clearly
indicates
that
application
of
ubiquitous
technologies
did
not
lead
to
radically
new
functionalities
that
could
have
been
exploited
by
the
concerned
industries
consequently
it
seems
to
be
possible
that
computer
aided
design
simply
steps
over
the
paradigm
of
ubiquitous
computing
and
expects
new
functionalities
from
the
emerging
new
computing
paradigms
such
as
brain–computer
interfacing
cyber–physical
computing
biological
computing
or
quantum
computing
examination
of
the
“digital
divide”
has
increasingly
gone
beyond
the
study
of
differences
in
physical
access
to
computers
to
focus
on
individuals’
use
of
technological
tools
for
empowered
and
generative
uses
in
this
research
study
we
investigated
the
relationship
between
access
to
tools
and
experience
with
creative
production
activities
our
participants
included
160
8th
grade
learners
from
two
public
middle
schools
the
local
communities
represented
by
the
two
schools
differed
in
parent
education
levels
proportion
of
recent
immigrants
and
average
family
income
findings
indicated
substantial
variability
in
students’
history
of
creative
production
experiences
within
both
communities
three
sets
of
analyses
were
completed
first
the
two
school
populations
were
compared
with
respect
to
average
levels
of
student
creative
production
experience
access
to
tools
at
home
use
of
learning
resources
frequency
of
technology
use
and
access
to
computing
outside
of
their
home
second
correlates
of
variability
in
individuals’
breadth
of
experience
with
creative
production
activities
were
explored
across
both
schools
through
a
regression
analysis
the
resulting
model
indicated
that
students’
experience
was
best
predicted
by
the
number
of
technology
tools
available
at
home
number
of
learning
resources
used
frequency
of
computer
use
at
home
and
non-home
access
network
size
in
a
third
analysis
profiles
of
experience
were
created
based
on
both
breadth
and
depth
of
experience
the
resulting
four
groups
of
students
were
compared
more
experienced
students
utilized
a
broader
range
of
learning
resources
had
access
to
more
tools
at
home
taught
a
wider
range
of
people
and
were
more
confident
in
their
computing
skills
the
groups
did
not
differ
in
their
self-reports
of
interest
in
learning
more
about
technology
this
chapter
introduces
the
concepts
of
memory
bound
application
it
uses
matrix
multiplication
to
illustrate
opportunities
for
reducing
the
number
of
global

accesses
it
then
introduces
the
tiling
technique
where
barrier
synchronization
is
used
to
coordinate
the
timing
of
executing
threads
for
improved
locality
and
reduced
global
memory
accesses
the
tiling
techniques
however
involve
additional
complexities
in
boundary
checks
the
chapter
uses
matrix
multiplication
to
illustrate
the
additional
boundary
checks
needed
for
a
tiled
kernel
to
be
applicable
to
arbitrary
matrix
sizes
the
chapter
concludes
with
an
overview
of
how
usage
of
shared
memory
and
registers
can
affect
the
number
of
thread
blocks
that
can
be
accommodated
in
each
streaming
multiprocessor
context
model-driven
approaches
are
increasingly
used

such
as

in
order

in
the

process
such

we
carried
out
a

conducting
both

we
found

approach
for
integrating

the
proliferation
of

has
driven
the
field
of

towards
the
development
of
tools
and
methods
that
may
benefit
from
the
produced
multi-modal
data
mmd
such

can
be
used
to
uncover
cognitive
affective

physiological
processes
during
learning
activities
combining
mmd
with
more
traditionally
exercised
assessment
tools
such
as
video
content
analysis
provides
a
more
holistic
understanding
of
children’s

experiences
and
has
the
potential
to
enable
the

capable
of
harmonising
children’s
cognitive
affective
and

processes
while
promoting
appropriately
balanced

efforts
however
the
use
of
an
mmd
mixed_methods
approach
that
combines
qualitative
and
mmd
data
to
understand
children’s
behaviours
during
engagement
with
mblt
is
rather
unexplored
we
present
an
in-situ
study
where
26
children
ages
10–12
solved
a
motion-based
sorting
task
for
learning
geometry
we
continuously
and
unobtrusively
monitored
children’s
learning
experiences
using
mmd
collection
via
eye-trackers
wristbands
kinect
joint
tracking
and
a
web
camera
we
devised
sp3
a
novel
observational
scheme
that
can
be
used
to
understand
children’s
solo
interactions
with
mblt
and
applied
it
to
identify
and
extract
children’s
evoked
play
and
problem-solving
behaviour
collective
analysis
of
the
mmd
and
video
codes
provided
explanations
of
children’s
task
performance
through
consideration
of
their
holistic

experience
lastly
we
applied
predictive
modelling
to
identify
the
synergies
between
various
mmd
measurements
and
children’s
play
and
problem-solving
behaviours
this
research
sheds
light
on
the
opportunities
offered
in
the
confluence
of
video

a
traditional
method
in

increased
its
service
lifespan
is
closely
related
to
the

the
important
embodiment
of
the
service

is
the
battery

the

the
long

can
be
realized
by
adjusting

therefore
real-time
accurate

has
a
significant
effect
on

the

is
introduced
to

the

is
implemented
in
the

the
iterative

are
introduced
into

consequently
the

radiation
hardening
also
known
as
“rad
hardening”
and
radiation
survivability
testing
are
of
critical
importance
to
defense
aerospace
and
energy
industries
everyone
knows
that
excessive
exposure
to
radiation
can
cause
severe
damage
to
living
things
but
high
radiation
levels
can
also
cause
radiation
damage
to
other
objects
especially
electronics
ionizing
radiation
in
particular
including
directly
ionizing
radiation
such
as
alpha
and
beta
particles
and
indirectly
ionizing
radiation
such
as
gamma
rays
and
neutron
radiation
is
profoundly
damaging
to
the
semiconductors
that
make
up
the
backbone
of
all
modern
electronics
just
one
charged
particle
can
interfere
with
thousands
of
electrons
causing
signal
noise
disrupting
digital
circuits
and
even
causing
permanent
physical
radiation
damage
radiation
hardening
involves
designing
radiation-tolerant
electronics
and
components
that
are
tolerant
of
the
massive
levels
of
ionizing
radiation
such
as
cosmic
outer
space
radiation
x-ray
radiation
in
medical
or
security
environments
and
high

radiation
within
nuclear

plants
in
order
to
test
these
components
and
determine
whether
they
are
sufficiently
hardened
radiation-hardened
electronics
manufacturers
perform
rigorous
testing
as
part
of
their
product
manufacturing
processes
components
which
pass
these
tests
go
into
production
and
can
be
described
as
“radiation-hardened”
components
that
do
not
go
back
to
design
companies
like
ritz
carlton
disney
and
verizon
are
among
many
who
have
invested
in
analytics
to
improve
their
customers
service
experiences
with
the
firms
extensive
data
are
collected
on
all
aspects
of
how
customers
interact
or
experience
the
products
or
services
research
has
shown
the
importance
of
the
“peak-end”
rule
in
service
design
that
is
providing
a
customer
with
good
“peak”
service
levels
and
“ending”
the
service
experience
with
high
quality
can
enhance
customer
satisfaction
and
build
loyalty
however
previous
studies
have
examined
this
phenomenon
only
in
contexts
with
unidimensional
service
levels
we
introduce
peak
cubes
which
enable
service
designers
and
scholars
to
pinpoint
prominent
service
levels
in
multidimensional
service
experience
profiles—thereby
extending
current
research
on
behavioral
economics
and
service
design
to
more
general
settings
results
indicate
the
potential
of
multidimensional
peak-end
models
to
better
predict
customer
satisfaction
in
various
service
scenarios
using
shapley
values
in
coalitional
game
theory
the
resulting
models
can
also
inform
service
designers
about
the
quality
dimensions
that
are
critical
from
the
perspective
of
multidimensional
peak-end
heuristic
and
customer
satisfaction
our
research
contributions
and
proposed
methodology
will
enhance
decision
support
systems
with
multidimensional
capabilities
and
have
applications
to
fields
as
diverse
as
service
operations
and
healthcare
designers
are
entrusted
with
increasingly
complex
and
impactful
challenges
however
the
current
system
of
design
education
does
not
always
prepare
students
for
these
challenges
when
we
examine
what
and
how
our
system
teaches
young
designers
we
discover
that
the
most
valuable
elements
of
the
designer’s
perspective
and
process
are
seldom
taught
instead
some
designers
grow
beyond
their
education
through
their
experience
working
in
industry
essentially
learning
by
accident
many
design
programs
still
maintain
an
insular
perspective
and
an
inefficient
mechanism
of
tacit
knowledge
transfer
meanwhile
skills
for
developing
creative
solutions
to
complex
problems
are
increasingly
essential
organizations
are
starting
to
recognize
that
designers
bring
something
special
to
this
type
of
work
a
rational
belief
based
upon
numerous
studies
that
link
commercial
success
to
a
design-driven
approach
so
what
are
we
to
do
other
learned
professions
such
as
medicine
law
and
business
provide
excellent
advice
and
guidance
embedded
within
their
own
histories
of
professionalization
in
this
article
we
borrow
from
their
experiences
to
recommend
a
course
of
action
for
design
it
will
not
be
easy
it
will
require
a
study
group
to
make
recommendations
for
a
roster
of
design
and
educational
practices
that
schools
can
use
to
build
a
curriculum
that
matches
their
goals
and
abilities
and
then
it
will
require
a
conscious
effort
to
bootstrap
the
design
profession
toward
both
a
robust
practitioner
community
and
an
effective
professoriate
capable
together
of
fully
realizing
the
value
of
design
in
the
21st
century
in
this
article
we
lay
out
that
path
sensory
evaluation
is
predicated
on
the
use
and
interpretation
of
human
language
we
ask
our
subjects
to
describe
their
sensory
experiences
and
affective
responses
which
we
cannot
directly
observe
this
formulation
of
sensory
science
encourages
direct
engagement
with
linguistics
and
in
particular
a
recent
subfield
of
linguistics
computer
science
and
artificial
intelligence
called
“natural
language
processing”
nlp
sometimes
“computational
linguistics”
in
this
chapter
we
will
provide
an
introduction
to
natural
language
processing
nlp
for
sensory
scientists
who
wish
to
employ
nlp
as
a
rapid
method
for
sensory
evaluation
because
nlp
is
a
large
diverse
and
rapidly
evolving
field
we
will
begin
with
a
brief
pragmatic
overview
of
the
discipline
with
an
emphasis
on
key
historical
and
current
methods
and
applications
we
will
then
briefly
discuss
the
linguistic
perspective
and
its
application
to
sensory
evaluation
with
an
aim
to
motivating
the
remaining
chapter
following
that
we
will
discuss
key
areas
of
nlp
from
data
collection
to
processing
to
analysis
to
advanced
applications
throughout
the
chapter
we
will
use
a
consistent
case

of
natural-language

for
a

publisher
summary
the
two
problems
that
characterize
the
modern
psychology
of
thinking
are
mental
representation
and
mental
computation
throughout
the
history
of
psychology
there
has
been
an
agreement
that
the
essential
features
of
a
problem
are
that
an
organism
has
a
goal
but
lacks
a
clear
or
well-learned
route
to
the
goal
thus
the
emphasis
in
research
on
problem_solving
has
been
on
response
discovery—how
the
organism
arrives
at
an
effective
goal-attaining
behavior
there
have
often
been
controversies
over
the
role
of
learning
or
past
experiences
in
problem_solving
this
chapter
illustrates
the
conflict
between
emphases
on
learning
and
emphases
on
perception
as
central
components
of
problem_solving
because
a
problem
solver
must
find
a
solution
it
might
seem
inevitable
that
an
essential
activity
tries
different
approaches
makes
errors
until
the
right
approach
is
found
earlier
in
problem-solving
research
trial
and
error
became
associated
with
the
view
that
acquiring
a
solution
was
a
gradual
undirected
process
that
did
not
involve
perception
or
comprehension
of
problem
requirements
or
structure
it
is
acknowledged
that
technological
innovation
is
needed
in
all
sectors
to
cope
with
new
demands
from
social
innovations
it
introduces
novel
ideas
whether
products
services
or
models
to
fulfil
societal
needs
and
foster
new
partnerships
or
collaborations
the
aim
is
to
enhance
social
interactions
and
elevate
human
well-being
development
of
cutting-edge
digital
technologies
is
reality
the
challenge
is
on
human
resource
side
how
quickly
we
can
prepare
employees
to
adapt
to
the
requirements
of
industry
40
and
society
50
in
the
paper
the
new
competencies
were
identified
with
the
business
stakeholders
by
conducting
a
survey
among
industry
partners
to
recognize
the
requirements
for
the
future
labor
market
the
stakeholders
in
the
construction
field
act
as
target
groups
for
monitoring
and
development
of
the
competencies
the
focus
of
the
result
part
is
on
the
competencies
companies
mostly
miss
from
their
employees
from
digital
perspectives
eg
reason
to

highly

possibilities
for

defined
as

expected
to
be

in
21st-century
higher_education
employees
it
is
highly
important
to
consider
the
job
market
needs
for
development
and
to
adopt
the
engineering
education
system
to
be
responsive
to
the
needs
of
labor
market
we
are
investigating
the
problem
of
establishing
computational
rather
than
syntactic
properties
of
forward-chaining
rule-based
expert
systems
we
model
an
expert
system
as
a
computation
on
working
memory
define
its
execution
semantics
and
present
proof
techniques
suitable
for
those
semantics
specifically
we
model
execution
as
a
dijkstra
guarded-do
construct
and
use
dijkstras
invariance
theorem
and
weakest
precondition
predicate
transformers
to
establish
invariants
safety
properties
and
postconditions
liveness
properties
our
approach
is
an
application
of
well-developed
methods
developed
by
dijkstra
and
others
for
the
verification
of
procedural
programs
this
paper
introduces
the
approach
reports
some
initial
results
and
discusses
future
work
over
the
years
various
technical
means
have
been
developed
to
protect
internet
users
from
phishing
attacks
to
enrich
the
anti-phishing
efforts
we
capitalise
on
concepts
from
graph
theories
and
propose
a
set
of
novel
graph
features
to
improve
the
phishing
detection
accuracy
the
initial
phase
of
the
proposed
technique
involved
the
extraction
of
hyperlinks
in
the
webpage
under
scrutiny
and
fetching
the
corresponding
neighbourhood
webpages
during
this
process
the
page
linking
data
were
collected
and
used
to
construct
a
web
graph
which
models
the
overall
hyperlink
and
network
structure
of
the
webpage
from
the
web
graph
graph
measures
were
computed
and
extracted
as
graph
features
to
derive
a
classifier
for
detecting
phishing
webpages
experimental
results
show
that
the
proposed
graph
features
achieve
an
improved
overall
accuracy
of
978
when
c45
was
utilised
as
classifier
outperforming
the
existing
conventional
features
derived
from
the
same
data
samples
unlike
conventional
features
the
proposed
graph
features
leverage
inherent
phishing
patterns
that
are
only
visible
at
a
higher
level
of
abstraction
thus
making
it
robust
and
difficult
to
be
evaded
by
direct
manipulations
on
the
webpage
contents
our
proposed
graph-based
technique
also
shows
promising
results
when
benchmarked
against
a
prominent
phishing
detection
technique
hence
the
proposed
technique
is
an
important
contribution
to
the
existing
anti-phishing
research
towards
improving
the
detection
performance
this
chapter
discusses
how
research
20
came
into
existence
and
how
it
developed
into
a
leading
paradigm
of
our
era
this
requires
an
outline
of
the
socio-technical
changes
brought
about
by
the
development
and
widespread
use
of
information
and
communications
technologies
based
on
computers
and
leading
to
the
appearance
of
social
media
there
is
no
one
who
would
deny
that
researchers
are
central
figures
in
research
so
their
skills
and
abilities
will
be
briefly
examined
research
20
is
closely
connected
to
the
idea
of
open
science
that
will
be
described
giving
especial
attention
to
its
main
constituent
that
is
open
access
open
science
also
comprises
the
data-intensive
paradigm
of
scientific
research
which
we
consider
in
detail
a
wider
uptake
of
research
20
is
inhibited
by
a
number
of
the
factors
of
scholarly
communication
so
we
will
enumerate
them

this

at
the
request
of
the
editors-in-chief
after
a
thorough
investigation
the

have
concluded
that
the
acceptance
of
this

was
partly
based
upon
the
positive
advice
of
one
illegitimate
reviewer
report
the

was
submitted
from
an

which
was
provided
to
the

as
a
suggested

during
the
submission
of
the

although
purportedly
a
real
reviewer
account
the
editors
have
concluded
that
this
was
not
of
an
appropriate
independent
reviewer
this
manipulation
of
the
peer-review
process
represents
a
clear
violation
of
the
fundamentals
of
peer
review
our
publishing
policies
and
publishing
ethics
standards
apologies
are
offered
to
the
reviewer
whose
identity
was
assumed
and
to
the
readers
of
the
journal
that
this
deception
was
not
detected
during
the
submission
process
what
would
it
take
to
build
a
computer
physician
that
can
take
its
place
amongst
human
peers
currently
neural
nets
especially
as
so-called
“deep
learning”
nets
dominate
what
is
popularly
called
“artificial
intelligence”
but
to
many
critics
they
seem
to
be
little
more
than
powerful
data-analytic
tools
inspired
by
some
of
the
more
basic
functions
and
regions
of
the
human
brain
such
as
those
involved
in
early
processes
in
biological
vision
classification
and
categorization
the
deeper
nature
of
human
intelligence
as
the
term
is
normally
meant
including
relating
to
consciousness
has
been
the
domain
of
philosophers
psychologists
and
some
neuroscientists
now
attention
is
turning
to
neuronal
mechanisms
in
humans
and
simpler
organisms
as
a
basis
of
a
truer
ai
with
far
greater
potential
arguably
the
approach
required
should
be
rooted
in
information
theory
and
algorithmic
science
but
as
discussed
in
this
paper
caution
is
required
“just
any
old
information”
might
not
do
the
information

actioning
nature
and
that
might
significantly
impact
the
kind
of

and
computer
hardware
required
overall
however
the
authors
do
not
favor
emergent
properties
such
as
those
based
on
complexity
and
quantum
effects
despite
the
possible
difficulties
such
studies
could
in
return
have
substantial
benefits
for
biology
and
medicine
beyond
the
computational
tools
that
they
produce
to
serve
those
disciplines
data
visualization
aims
to
convey
quantitative
and
qualitative
information
effectively
by
determining
which
techniques
and
visualizations
are
most
appropriate
for
different
situations
and
why
various
software
solutions
can
produce
numerous
visualizations
of
the
same
data
set
however
data
visualization
encompasses
a
wide
range
of
visual
configurations
that
depend
on
factors
such
as
the
type
of
data
being
displayed
the
different
displays
eg
scatter
plots
line
graphs
and
pie
charts
the
visual
components
used
to
represent
the
data
eg
lines
dots
and
bars
and
the
specific
visual
attributes
of
those
components
eg
color
shape
size
and
length
a
similar
problem
arises
when
designing
data
tables
where
the
dimensionality
of
the
data
and
its
complexity
influence
the
choice
of
the
most
appropriate
structure
eg
unidirectional
bidirectional
often
this
broad
spectrum
of
configurations
requires
a
visualization
expert
who
knows
which
techniques
are
best
for
which
type
of
data
source
and
what
is
to
be
conveyed
typically
researchers
and
developers
lack
knowledge
of
data
visualization
best
practices
and
must
learn
the
design
principles
that
enable
effective
communication
and
the
technical
details
of
the
specific
software
tool
they
use
to
generate
visualizations
this
paper
proposes
a
software
product
line
approach
to
model
and
realize
the
variability
of
the
visualization
design
process
using
feature
models
to
encode
knowledge
about
design
best
practices
in
graphs
and
charts
our
approach
involves
solving
visualization
design
variability
through
a
stepwise
configuration
process
and
evaluating
the
proposal
for
a
specific
software
visualization
tool
our
solution
facilitates
effective
communication
of
quantitative
results
by
helping
researchers
and
developers
select
and
generate
the
most
effective
visualizations
for
each
case
this
approach
opens
up
new
opportunities
for
research
at
the
intersection
of

and
variability

raise
several
important
concerns
and
questions
to

by
future
research
tor
is
one
of
the
most
popular
anonymity
networks
that
allows
internet
users
to
hide
their
browsing
activity
hiding
browsing
activity
is
essential
for
internet
users
to
increase
their
privacy
only
tor
users
should
know
the
website
they
are
browsing
however
an
attacker
can
utilise
the
website
fingerprinting
wf
attack
to
identify
webpages
browsed
by
tor
users
wf
is
a
significant
threat
to
internet
users
privacy
as
tor
should
conceal
the
browsed
webpages
information
existing
wf
studies
focused
on
the
investigation
to
improve
the
identification
capabilities
overlooking
the
systematic
discussion
and
assessment
of
existing
techniques
in
addition
existing
surveys
and
analyses
reviewed
insufficient
variation
of
wf
on
tor
techniques
therefore
this
survey
paper
aims
to
provide
a
systematic
and
thorough
review
of
various
wf
on
tor
techniques
first
we
discuss
wf
on
tor
techniques
in
five
primary
aspects
threat
model
victim
target
website
realm
traffic
feature
and
traffic
classifier
we
analyse
and
classify
the
reviewed
studies
on
each
wf
aspect
the
classification
facilitates
in-depth
understanding
and
comparison
between
wf
on
tor
techniques
furthermore
this
paper
investigates
nine
assumptions
exercised
in
wf
on
tor
closed-world
sequential
browsing
isolated
traffic
replicability
traffic
parsing
passive
webpage
disabled
cache
static
content
and
single
webpage
these
assumptions
limit
the
wf
on
tors
practicality
in
real-world
scenarios
our
analysis
and
classification
indicate
that
most
wf
on
tor
studies
apply
these
assumptions
despite
being
only
suitable
in
controlled
environments
or
laboratory
experiments
in
addition
most
reviewed
studies
often
lack
transparency
on
the
assumptions
exercised
in
their
studies
risking
misunderstanding
the
wf
on
tor
techniques
actual
practicality
at
the
end
of
this

we
present
wf

phase
in
this
chapter
we
will
delve
into
the
art
of
constructing
agent-based
models
helbing
2012
agent-based
modeling
is
a
powerful
and
versatile
tool
that
allows
us
to
simulate
complex
systems
by
representing
individual
agents
and
their
interactions
within
a
given
environment
here
we
will
take
a
step-by-step
approach
starting
with
classic
models
and
gradually
moving
toward
creating
customized
versions
by
understanding
how
these
models
work
and
learning
how
to
modify
and
extend
them
we
will
gain
valuable
insights
into
alternative
scenarios
and
even
uncover
entirely
new
phenomena
in
this
chapter
the
authors
argue
that
the
school
science
classroom
should
help
students
deal
with
complex
real-life
information
about
health
and
disease
they
also
discuss
means
by
which
curriculum
and
instruction
in
science
education
can
be
tied
to
these
issues
the
chapter
reviews
opportunities
and
challenges
presented
to
individuals
by
the
expectations
of
participatory
health
care
focusing
on
models
of
health
literacy
that
can
help
understand
and
address
the
challenges
the
authors
argue
that
the
problem
of
ensuring
effective
information
use
often
lies
in
a
transmission
approach
to
health
information
provision
transmitted
knowledge
is
often
not
understood
nor
applied
as
demonstrated
in
studies
of
human
papillomavirus
vaccination
education
an
alternative
to
knowledge
transmission
is
the
approach
that
aims
to
foster
critical
literacy
which
is
grounded
in
critical_thinking
essential
to
the
practice
of
science
the
chapter
reviews
a
number
of
interdisciplinary
science
education
activities
that
introduce
health
issues
in
the
context
of
biology
physics
and
chemistry
education
ensuring
deep
understanding
needed
for
developing
critical
literacy
it
also
discusses
science
education
approaches
and
theories
that
encourage
the
development
of
deep
culturally
meaningful
science
knowledge
finally
the
chapter
reviews
professional
development
and
the
role
of
various
professionals
including
teachers
and
librarians
in
the
collaborative
endeavor
of
effective
health
information
provision
teachers
in
england
are
required
to
ensure
that
learners
from
the
age
of
five
are
taught
about
algorithms
and
program
design
yet
there
is
evidence
that
despite
teachers
reporting
that
design
is
important
they
are
not
converting
this
into
classroom
practice
this
paper
describes
a
survey
study
in
which
we
explored
teachers’
difficulties
in
using
design
we
surveyed
207
teachers
asking
them
free-text
questions
on
their
use
of
design
in
teaching
programming
and
their
views
of
pupils’
responses
to
using
design
in
the
survey
we
also
investigated
teachers’
understanding
of
the
term
algorithm
an
essential
concept
which
may
be
a
contributing
factor
in
their
difficulties
with
design
we
provide
underpinning
data
on
the
difficulties
of
using
design
that
teachers
of
pupils
aged
from
5
to
11
years
old
grades
k
to
5
have
in
teaching
programming
difficulties
with
design
identified
include
pupil
resistance
a
lack
of
time
a
lack
of
pupil
and
teacher
expertise
conflicting
pedagogical
choices
and
a
general
confusion
over
what
an
algorithm
is
there
were
statistically
significant
differences
in
selection
of
the
term
‘algorithm’
to
describe
programming
artefacts
whether
a
teacher
was
a
specialist
or
a
generalist
what
training
they
had
received
on
programming
or
design
the
age
group
taught
and
programming
language
used
teachers
were
more
likely
to
call
a
complex
code
snippet
an
‘algorithm’
than
a
simpler
one
and
more
likely
to
select
the
term
to
describe
code
snippets
than
a
design
artefact
we
make
suggestions
of
how
to
alleviate
the
problems
including
that
teachers
are
introduced
to
the
idea
of
ambiguous
representations
of
algorithms
and
a
process
which
refines
the
representation
from
ambiguous
to
unambiguous
as
the
design
progresses
many
nations
are
greatly
affected
by
their
education
policies
and
the
educational
level
of
different
schools
is
relevant
to
a
nation’s
ict
policy
in
the
area
of
ict
korea
has
achieved
quite
high
levels
of
competency
this
study
analyzed
the
level
of
ict
competency
of
4490
elementary
and
2419
middle
schools
in
korea
within
the
context
of
the
korean
educational
system
and
social
circumstances
the
findings
are
as
follows
first
differences
in
ict
level
were
greater
among
elementary
schools
than
among
middle
schools
and
secondly
ict
usage
had
a
great
impact
on
the
ict
composite
index
for
both
elementary
and
middle
schools
for
both
elementary
and
middle
schools
the
indicators
that
were
found
to
have
the
greatest
impact
on
the
ict
composite
index
were
‘effort
to
make
use
of
computers
and
ict
resources’
and
‘teaching
of
ict-related
subjects’
another
variable
that
affected
ict
competency
was
the
level
of
ict
competency
among
the
teachers
and
their
willingness
to
use
ict
in
their
lessons
this
study
found
that
merely
the
building
of
an
ict
infrastructure
is
not
enough
to
enhance
the
ict
level
of
schools
in
addition
to
an
ict
infrastructure
the
efforts
of
the
teachers
and
administration
were
more
important
than
any
other
factors
the
findings
of
this
study
might
provide
useful
suggestions
to
other
nations
that
are
endeavoring
to
enhance
the
ict
levels
of
their
schools
in
the
rapidly
evolving
landscape
of
digital
competencies
the
need
for
a
robust
and
universal
method
to
assess
students’
algorithmic_thinking
at
skills
has
become
increasingly
pronounced
algorithmic_thinking
refers
to
the
ability
to
analyse
a
problem
and
develop
a
step-by-step
process
to
solve
it
this
research
investigates
the
efficacy
of
the
cross
array
task
cat
as
an
assessment
tool
for
at
skills
within
switzerland’s
compulsory
education
system
originally
conceptualised
as
an
unplugged
activity
where
students
performed
the
task
without
digital
technologies
eg
by
using
gestures
on
paper
and
an
administrator
manually
assessed
them
the
cat
evolved
into
a
digital
activity
that
runs
on
an
ipad
the
cat’s
digital
transformation
has
automated
the
scoring
of
student
responses
and
data
collection
streamlining
the
assessment
processes
and
facilitating
efficient
large-scale
assessments
it
has
also
enhanced
scalability
making
the
cat
suitable
for
widespread
use
in
educational
settings
furthermore
it
provides
immediate
feedback
to
students
and
educators
supporting
timely
interventions
and
personalised
learning
experiences
our
study
aims
to
comprehensively
investigate
algorithmic
competencies
in
compulsory
education
examining
their
variations
and
influencing
factors
this
research
examines
key
variables
such
as
age
sex
educational
environment
and
school
characteristics
eg
the
level
and
grade
of
education
and
regional
factors
eg
the
canton
of
the
school
in
switzerland
and
characteristics
related
to
the
specific
assessment
tool
including
the
type
of
artefact
used
the
complexity
of
the
algorithms
generated
and
the
level
of
autonomy
additionally
it
seeks
to
analyse
the
effectiveness
of
the
unplugged
and
digital
approaches
in
assessing
at
skills
specifically
comparing
the
unplugged
and
virtual
cat
versions
aiming
to
provide
insights
into
their
advantages
and
potential
synergies
this
investigation
delineates
the
developmental
progression
of
at
skills
across
compulsory
education
emphasising
the
influence
of
age
on
algorithm
development
and
problem-solving
strategies
furthermore
we
reveal
the
impact
of
artefacts
and
the
potential
of
digital
tools
to
facilitate
advanced
at
skill
development
across
diverse
age
groups
finally
our
investigation
delves
into
the
influence
of
school
environments
and
sex
disparities
on
at
performance
alongside
the
significant
individual
variability
influenced
by
personal
abilities
and
external
circumstances
these
findings
underscore
the
importance
of
tailored
educational
interventions
and
equitable
practices
to
accommodate
diverse
learning
profiles
and
optimise
student
outcomes
in
at
across
educational

the
introduction
of
interactive
assets
in
public
exhibitions
is
capable
to
significantly
enhance
the

could
represent
a
challenging
task
especially
for

this
paper
first
analyses
pros
and
cons
of
tools
devised
so
far
to
support
the
generation
of
interactive
contents
then
it
presents
the
design
of
a
new
tool
named
visual
scene
editor
vse
which
allows
users
with
little
to
no
programming
skills
to
create
3d
interactive
applications
by
combining
available
assets
through
an
interactive
visual
process
both
objective
and
subjective
measurements
have
been
collected
with
both
skilled
and
unskilled
users
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
the
proposed

a
comparison
with
existing

shows
a
reduction
in
the
time
required
to
complete
the
assigned
tasks
of
the
complexity
of
the
logic
created
as
well
as
of
the
number
of

made
confirming
the
suitability
of
the
vse
for
the
said
purpose
the
long

has
attracted
substantial
theoretical
as
well
as
practical
interest
yet
there
have
been
few
empirical

that
have
explicitly
examined
the
factors
that
drive

block-based
programming
languages
are
becoming
increasingly
common
in
introductory
computer

classrooms
across

spectrum
one
justification
for
the
use
of
block-based
environments
in
formal
educational
settings
is
the
idea
that
the
concepts
and
practices
developed
using
these
introductory
tools
will
prepare
learners
for
future
computer

learning
opportunities
this
view
is
built
on
the
assumption
that
the
attitudinal
and
conceptual
learning
gains
made
while
working
in
the
introductory
block-based
environments
will
transfer
to
conventional
text-based

test
this
hypothesis
this

the

summary
this
chapter
is
an
attempt
to
clear
the
names
of
artificial
intelligence
ai
and
computational
cognitive
science
these
two
related
disciplines
have
been
accused
of
a
conceptual
error
so
profound
that
their
very
existence
is
jeopardized
sometimes
however
philosophers
successfully
arrest
and
lock
up
the
guilty
the
best
example
of
this
ironically
is
in
psychology
artificial
intelligence
and
computational
cognitive
science
are
both
committed
to
the
claim
that
computers
can
think
the
former
is
committed
to
the
claim
that
human-made
computers
can
think
while
computational
cognitive
science
is
committed
to
the
view
that
naturally
occurring
computers
brains
think
ai
is
the
field
dedicated
to
building
intelligent
computers
ai
ultimately
wants
a
machine
that
could
solve
very
difficult
novel
problems
like
proving
fermats

theorem
correcting
the
greenhouse
effect
or
figuring
out
the
fundamental
structure
of

historically
ai
is
associated
with
computer
science
but
the
compleat
ai
researcher
frequently
knows
a
fair
amount
of
psychology
linguistics
neuroscience
mathematics
and
possibly
some
other
discipline
the
rapid
advancement
of
artificial
intelligence
ai
has
brought
transformative
changes
to
various
aspects
of
human
life
leading
to
an
exponential
increase
in
the
number
of
ai
users
the
broad
access
and
usage
of
ai
enable
immense
benefits
but
also
give
rise
to
significant
challenges
one
way
for
ai
users
to
address
these
challenges
is
to
develop
ai
literacy
referring
to
human
proficiency
in
different
subject
areas
of
ai
that
enable
purposeful
efficient
and
ethical
usage
of
ai
technologies
this
study
aims
to
comprehensively
understand
and
structure
the
research
on
ai
literacy
for
ai
users
through
a
systematic
scoping
literature
review
therefore
we
synthesize
the
literature
provide
a
conceptual
framework
and
develop
a
research
agenda
our

paper
holistically
assesses
the
fragmented

landscape
68

while
critically
examining
its
specificity
to
different
user
groups
and
its
distinction
from
other
technology
literacies
exposing
that
research
efforts
are
partly
not
well
integrated
we
organize
our
findings
in
an
overarching
conceptual
framework
structured
along
the
learning
methods
leading
to
the
components
constituting
and
the
effects
stemming
from
ai
literacy
our
research
agenda
–
oriented
along
the
developed
conceptual
framework
–
sheds
light
on
the
most
promising
research
opportunities
to
prepare
ai
users
for
an
ai-powered
future
of
work
and
society
the
uncomputable
parts
of
thinking
if
there
are
any
can
be
studied
in
much
the
same
spirit
that
turing
1950
suggested
for
the
study
of
its
computable
parts
we
can
develop
precise
accounts
of
cognitive
processes
that
although
they
involve
more
than
computing
can
still
be
modelled
on
the
machines
we
call
‘computers’
in
this
paper
i
want
to
suggest
some
ways
that
this
might
be
done
using
ideas
from
the
mathematical
theory
of
uncomputability
or
recursion
theory
and
i
want
to
suggest
some
uses
to
which
the
resulting
models
might
be
put
the
reader
more
interested
in
the
models
and
their

than
the

and
its

at
the
beginning
of

all

algorithmic_thinking
is
a
type
of
thinking
that
occurs
in
the
context
of
computational
thinking
given
its
importance
in
the
current
educational
context
it
seems
pertinent
to
deepen
into
its
conceptual
and
operational
understanding
for

the
exploration
of
research
shows
us
that
there
are
almost
no
studies
at
university
level
where
algorithmic_thinking
is
connected
to
mathematical
thinking
and
more
importantly
to
characterise
it
and
be
able
to
analyse
and
evaluate
it
better
the
aim
of
this
research
is
to
characterise
algorithmic_thinking
in
a
university
context
of
the
bachelors
degree
in
mathematics
by
unplugged
tasks
offering
a
model
of

through
categories
that
establish
connections
between
mathematical
and
algorithmic
working
spaces
in
three
dimensions
semiotic
instrumental
and
discursive
the
results
confirm
the
interaction
between
these
dimensions
and
their
predictive
value
for
better
programming
performance
the
study
also
adds
novel
considerations
related
to
the
role
and
interaction
of
mathematical
and
computational

involved
in
algorithmic_thinking
although
instruments
for
assessing

ct
concepts
in
primary_education
have
been
developed
they
have
rarely
been
validated
in
terms
of
item_response_theory
irt
we
consider
irt
to
be
a
rigorous
validation
tool
and
apply
it
to
a
ct
concepts
test
for
primary_education
involving
13670
students
a

model
was
chosen
over
other
irt
models
as
it
indicated
an
acceptable
model
fit
and
item

the
discrimination
parameters
indicated
that
the
instrument
could
effectively
distinguish
between
students
with
various
ability
levels
nominal
response
modelling
in
irt
was
used
to
retrieve
information
from
the
students
responses
and
those
with
a
lower
ability
level
were
found
to
only
consider
one
of
the

no
understanding
of
the
repetition
structure
and
might
have
difficulties
in
associating
a
sprite
with
its
corresponding
codes
based
on
ability
estimates
we
also
found
that
the
students’
ability
in
terms
of
ct
concepts
increased
with
grades
and
that
boys
generally
performed
slightly
better
than
girls
these
results
suggest
that
the
instrument
can
be
used
to
examine
the
learning
achievements
of
students
in
terms
of
ct
concepts
there
has
been
growing
interest
in
assessing
computational

were
the

the

suggest
that
a

effectively
develops

however
continuous

is
important
especially
in
addressing

ct
has
been
investigated
from
different
perspectives
this
research
aims
to
investigate
how
secondary_school
girls
perceive
ct
practices
–
the
problem-solving
practices
that
students
apply
while
they
are
engaged
in
programming
–
when
using
the
microbit
device
in
a
collaborative
setting
this
study
also
explores
the
collaborative
programming
process
of
secondary_school
girls
with
the
microbit
device
we
conducted
mixed-methods
research
with
203
secondary_school
girls
in
the
state
of
victoria
australia
and
31
mentors
attending
a
girls-only
ct
program
ozgirlsct

the
girls
were
grouped
into
52
teams
and
collaboratively
developed
computational
solutions
around
realistic
important
problems
to
them
and
their
communities
we
distributed
two
surveys
with
193
responses
each
to
the
girls
further
we
surveyed
the
mentors
with
31
responses
who
monitored
the
girls
and
collected
their

reports
on
their
teams
our
study
indicates
that
the
girls
found
“debugging”
the
most
difficult
type
of
ct
practice
to
apply
while
collaborative
practices
of
ct
were
the
easiest
we
found
that
prior
coding
experience
significantly
reduced
the
difficulty
level
of
only
one
ct
practice
-
“debugging”
our
study
also
identified
six
challenges
the
girls
faced
and
six
best

they
adopted
when
working
on
their
computational

preparing
younger
generations
to
engage

with
digital
technology
is
often
seen
as
one
of
the
goals
of
21st
century
education
jeanettewing’s
seminal
work
on
computational

ct
is
an
important
landmark
for
this
goal
ct
represents
a
way
of
thinking
a
set
of
problem-solving
skills
which
can
be
valuable
when
interacting
with
digital
technologies
and
with
different
fields
of
knowledge
such
as
arts
and
humanities
even
if
this
cross-areas
relevance
has
been
celebrated
and
acknowledged
in
theoretical
research
there
has
been
a
lack
of
practical
projects
exploring
these
links
between
ct
and
non-stem
fields
this
research
develops
these
links
we
present
a
specific
case
–
a

by
two
14
years-old
boys
–
within

in
which
students
aged
13–14
from

school
have
developed

based
on
their
own
readings
of
the
anglo-saxon
poem
beowulf
during
an
after-school

the
game
was
produced
using

3d
assets
such
as

and
a

we
argue
that

be
a
means
to
foster
the

this
chapter
introduces
the
concept
of
computational

it
builds
on
the
previous
chapters
to
illustrate
the
central
theme
in
computational

it
first
reviews
the
main
goals
of
parallel

it
then
discusses
the
thinking
process
of
problem
decomposition
and
algorithm
selection
it
then
goes
into
the
main
concepts
covered
in
the
previous
chapters
and
shows
how
they
can
be
generalized
into
broader
computational
problem_solving
techniques
educational
research
on

there
have
been
attempts
to
investigate
learners’
computer

patterns
using
high-frequency

collection
this
approach
can
be
considered
as
process-based
analysis
as
opposed
to
outcome-based
analysis
ie
the
use
of
test
or
exam
scores
in
this
process-based
approach
to
investigate
learners’
computer
programming
process
we
included
two
critical
constructs
in
our
research
self-regulated

and
computational

skills
we
aimed
to
identify
learners’
computer
programming
patterns
in
the
context
that
novice
students
learn
a
computer
programming
language
python
in
an
online

environment
we
examined
the
relationships
between
the
learners’
coding
patterns
self-regulated
learning
and
computational
thinking
skills
initially
we
adopted
a
traditional
approach
with
the
aggregate
data
of

behaviors
we
then
utilized
a
computational

approach
to
learner
performance
self-regulated

skills
with
ever-changing
computer

in
our
initial
approach
the
indicators
of

data
were
not
associated
with
learners
learning

in
the

revealed
significant
differences
between
the

it
could
be
said
that

we
present
a
qualitative
study
on
robot
designer
intentions
conducted
by
group
interviews
with
designers
of
two
common
but
significantly
different
programmable
robots
the
kubo
robot
and
the
rugged
robot
using
activity
theory
as
the
underlying
framework
for
the
thematic
analysis
of
the
interviews
our
data
reveal
a
large
overlap
of
the
intentions
of
both
groups
they
express
the
common
goal
of
preparing
children
for
the
future
although
through
slightly
different
competencies
enhancing
computational
thinking
and
21st
century
skills
respectively
both
groups
highlight
the
relevance
of
subjects
outside
computer
science
specifically
beyond
coding
our
data
also
show
a
design
process
difference
the
rugged
robot
was
developed
with
a
teacher-oriented
approach
whereas
the
kubo
robot
with
an
object-oriented
approach
although
several
investigations
of
spatial
reasoning
and
mental
rotation
skills
have
been
conducted
in
research
areas
linked
to
stem
education
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
few
of
these
studies
have
examined
the
relationship
between
spatial
reasoning
and
computational
thinking
given
this
gap
in
the
literature
the
present
study
investigates
the
role
and
action
of
spatial
reasoning
and
specifically
the
effects
of
mental
rotation
on
computational
thinking
within
an
embodied
and
enacted
perspective
to
achieve
this
we
carried
out
a
study
involving
92
students
in
five
primary-school
classes
1st
grade
-
5th
grade
the
findings
reveal
a
positive
correlation
between
computational
thinking
skill
and
mental
rotation
ability
despite
the
significant
emphasis
placed
on
incorporating
21st
century
skills
into
the
educational
framework
particularly
at
the
primary
level
recent
scholarly
works
indicate
considerable
variation
in
the
implementation
of
these
skills
across
different
countries
and
regions
suggesting
a
demand
for
further
research
specifically
focusing
on
primary_education
the

have
outlined
the
key
competences
for
lifelong

needed
for
all
citizens
including

in
this
perspective
education
plays
a
fundamental
role
in
ensuring
that
citizens
acquire
the
required

the
objective
in
the
common
european
framework
is
clear
to
initiate
a
transition
from
the

to
the

nowadays
technological

following
these

in
this

we
want
to
point
out
new
research
reflections
and
perspectives
that
could
help
researchers
teachers
educators
and
consequently
students
to
reflect
on
the
introduction

and
on
how
these
can

and
on
the
acquisition
of
new
skills
and
competences
specifically
creativity
critical_thinking
problem_solving
and
computational

for
the
educational

the
analysis
carried
on
suggests
a
perspective
on
how
creativity
critical_thinking
and
problem-solving
can
be
effective
in
promoting
computational

and
how
artificial

could
be
an
aid
instrument
to
teachers
in
the
fostering
of

in
schools
and
educational
contexts
this
study
explored
the
ways
that
the
computational
thinking
ct
process
can
be
evaluated
in
a
classroom
environment
thirty
children
aged
10–11
years
from
a
primary_school
in
london
took
part
in
a
game-making
project
using
the
scratch
and
alice
24
applications
for
eight
months
for
the
focus
of
this
specific
paper
data
from
participant
observations
informal
conversations
problem-solving
sheets
semi-structured
interviews
and
children’s
completed
games
were
used
to
make
sense
of
elements
of
the
computational
thinking
process
and
approaches
to
evaluate
these
elements
in
a
computer
game
design
context
the
discussions
around
what
ct
consists
highlighted
the
complex
structure
of
computational
thinking
and
the
interaction
between
the
elements
of
artificial
intelligence
ai
computer
cognitive
learning
and
psychological
sciences
this
also
emphasised
the
role
of
metacognition
in
the
computational
thinking
process
these
arguments
illustrated
that
it
is
not
possible
to
evaluate
computational
thinking
using
only
programming
constructs
as
ct
process
provides
opportunities
for
developing
many
other
skills
and
concepts
therefore
a
multiple
evaluation
approach
should
be
adopted
to
illustrate
the
full
learning
scope
of
the
computational
thinking
process
using
the
support
of
literature
review
and
the
findings
of
the
data
analysis
i
proposed
a
multiple
approach
evaluation
model
where
‘computational_concepts’
‘metacognitive
practices’
and
‘learning
behaviours’
were
discussed
as
the
main
elements
of
the
ct
process
additionally
in
order
to
investigate
these
dimensions
within
a
game-making
context
computer
game
design
was
also
included
in
this
evaluation
model
several
studies
have
reported
that
adaptivity
and
personalization
in
educational
computer
games
facilitate
reaching
their
full
educational
potential
however
there
is
little
effort
to
develop
adaptive
educational
computer
games
for
promoting
students
computational
thinking
ct
in
this
study
an
adaptive
computer
game
is
introduced
called
autothinking
that
not
only
promotes
both
ct
skills
and
conceptual
knowledge
but
also
provides
adaptivity
in
both
game-play
and
learning
processes
to
evaluate
the
possible
effects
of
the
game
an
experimental
study
was
carried
out
with
79
students
in
an
elementary_school
in
estonia
autothinking
and
a
conventional
technology-enhanced_learning
approach
were
used
for
teaching
ct
to
the
experimental
and
control
group
respectively
our
results
reveal
that
autothinking
improved
students’
ct
skills
and
conceptual
knowledge
better
than
the
conventional
approach
it
was
also
found
that
students
with
a
low
and
high
level
of
prior
knowledge
made
higher
improvement
in
knowledge
gain
using
the
adaptive
game
compared
to
the
traditional
approach
especially
those
students
with
lower
prior
knowledge
finally
our
findings
show
that
the
adaptive
game
could
also
improve
students
learning
attitude
toward
ct
better
than
the
conventional
approach
especially
those
students
with
higher
prior
learning
attitudes
computational
thinking
ct
through
programming
in
higher_education
is
considered
an
important
skill
for
students
to
become
problem
solvers
and
thrive
in
the
new
digital
workplace
despite
the
wide
interest
a
systematic
map
of
ct
through
programming
in
higher_education
is
still
missing
the
aim
of
this
study
is
twofold
first
we
aim
to
provide
a
systematic
map
of
the
relevant
research
by
identifying
the
areas
and
sub-areas
of
ct
through
programming
teaching
and
learning
in
higher_education
second
we
aim
to
investigate
these
areas
based
on
two
dimensions
their
evolution
over
the
years
and
the
branches
to
which
ct
is
applied
for
this
purpose
we
apply
a
systematic
mapping
methodology
main
results
include
the
identification
of
the
ct
areas
of
knowledge
base
assessment
learning
strategies
tools
factors
and
capacity
building
of
these
knowledge
base
assessment
and
tools
have
significantly
evolved
throughout
the
years
while
capacity
building
has
only
recently
emerged
in
addition
the
introduction
of
ct
to
undergraduate
students
and
preservice
teachers
differs
mainly
in
the
tools
used
and
the
ct
elements
that
are
assessed
the
study
contributes
to
the
field
by
providing
a
structured
type
of
research
conducted
and
identifying
gaps
and
opportunities
for
future
research
computational
thinking
ct
is
arising
as
a
set
of
problem-solving
skills
that
must
be
acquired
by
the
new
generations
of
students
to
fully
understand
and
participate
in
our
computer-based
world
however
from
a
psychometric
approach
we
are
still
at
an
early
stage
regarding
the
definition
and
assessment
of
ct
as
a
psychological
variable
one
way
to
advance
in
this
area
is
to
investigate
whether
‘computationally
talented’
students
ie
‘computational
top
thinkers’
can
be
detected
even
before
learning
to
code
and
if
so
how
to
teach
them
properly
to
fully
develop
their
high-computational
ability
this
paper
presents
several
empirical
concatenated
studies
about
the
predictive
validity
of
the
computational_thinking_test
ctt
which
is
administered
on
a
sample
of
314
middle
school
spanish
students
n314
we
report
the
predictive
validity
of
the
ctt
conducted
at
the
beginning
of
the
quarter
with
respect
to
academic
performance
informatics
mathematics
and
language
and
learning
analytics
in
a
codeorg
course
collected
at
the
end
of
the
quarter
we
also
analyze
the
predictive
validity
of
the
ctt
to
early
distinguish
between
‘computational
regular
thinkers’
and
‘computational
top
thinkers’
ie
those
who
spontaneously
accelerated
from
the
‘block-based’
programming
environment
of
codeorg
to
the
‘text-based’
one
of
khan
academy
finally
we
perform
a
case
study
over
two
of
the
students
categorized
as
‘computational
top
thinkers’
in
which
one
of
their
coding
products
written
in
processing
javascript
is
described
our
results
demonstrate
that
‘computationally
talented’
students
can
be
detected
in
middle
school
and
that
these
subjects
have
the
ability
to
accelerate
in
the
computer
science
education
standards
between
1
and
2
years
compared
to
the
regular
learners
this
could
have
major
implications
on
the
emerging
computing
curricula
which
should
take
into
account
these
individual
differences
in
computational
ability
and
‘learning-how-to-code’
speed
to
ensure
an
appropriate
progression
for
every
student
computational
thinking
ct
through
programming
attracts
increased
attention
as
it
is
considered
an
ideal
medium
for
the
development
of
21st

this
intense
attention
leads
to
k-12
initiatives
around
the
world
and
a
rapid
increase
in
relevant
research

however
studies
show
challenges
in

the
purpose
of
this

is
to
develop
a
conceptual

consists
of
six
ct
areas
namely

the

studies
in
addition
it
could
support
the

the
most
critical
issues
that
need

are
the

this

examines
the
growing
field
of
computational

ct
in

a
review
of
the
relevant
literature
shows
a
diversity
in
definitions
interventions
assessments
and
models
after
synthesizing
various
approaches
used
to
develop
the
construct
in
k-16
settings
we
have
created
the
following
working
definition
of
ct
the
conceptual
foundation
required
to
solve
problems
effectively
and
efficiently
ie
algorithmically
with
or
without
the
assistance
of
computers
with
solutions
that
are
reusable
in
different
contexts
this
definition
highlights
that
ct
is
primarily
a
way
of
thinking
and
acting
which
can
be
exhibited
through
the
use
particular
skills
which
then
can
become
the
basis
for
performance-based
assessments
of
ct
skills
based
on
the
literature
we
categorized
ct
into
six
main
facets
decomposition
abstraction
algorithm
design
debugging
iteration
and
generalization
this
paper
shows
examples
of
ct
definitions
interventions
assessments
and
models
across
a
variety
of
disciplines
with
a
call
for
more
extensive
research
in
this
area
since
the
end
of
the
20th
century
the
digitalization
of
society
including
the
educational
systems
has
been
growing
exponentially
at
the
same
time
education
systems
have
been
evolving
towards
competency-based
assessment
likewise
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
the
idea
of
computational
thinking
was
resurrected
by
j
wing
for
solving
problems
and
designing
systems
using
concepts
of
computer
science
today
we
can
see
how
all
these
questions
are
taking
shape
in
a
new
competence
called
computational
thinking
related
to
others
that
already
exist
in
this
paper
we
have
studied
the
skills
of
computational
thinking
in
university
students
focusing
on
abstraction
and
its
possible
relationship
with
other
factors
results
conclude
that
the
students
fail
in
relation
to
abstraction
and
in
algorithmic_thinking
although
the
ability
of
abstraction
is
not
easy
to
measure
a

has
been
carried
out
in

the
data
comprises
four
fourth-grade
student
dyads
using

a
block-based
programming
tool
for
two
open-ended
creative

sessions
we
sought
insight
into
how
the
dyads
put
four
intertwined
ct
dimensions
–
planning
iteration
collaboration
social
interactions
and
remixing
and
debugging
–
into
practice
to
examine
these
dimensions
the

the

provide
especially
evidence-based

in

provided
based
on
the
findings
several
countries
have
usually
adopted
several
priorities
for
developing
ict
competences
from
kindergarten
to
secondary_education
most
of
them
are
focused
on
the
development
of
key
competences
andor
coding
skills
although
coding
may
be
very
attractive
for
young
students
and
a
very
good
practice
or
experience
it
could
be
more
interesting
to
develop
students
logical_thinking
skills
and
problem-solving
skills
throughout
programming
approaches
or
computational

this
is
a
very
exciting
challenge
with
lots
of
possibilities
regarding
coding
robots

game-based_learning
and
so
on
thus
it
is
very
important
to
explore
the
effect
that
these
experiences
have
been
taking
into
the
pre-university
students
both
at
primary
and
secondary_education
with
a
special
focus
on
the
computational
thinking
as
one
of
the
components
inside
the
toolbox
to
develop
a
reflexive
and
critical
education
in
order
to
help
children
to
solve
problems
using
the
technology
with
which
they
will
live
daily
the
aim
of
this
study
is
to
investigate
whether
a
programming
activity
might
serve
as
a
learning
vehicle
for
mathematics
acquisition
in
grades
four
and
five
for
this
purpose
the
effects
of
a
programming

an
essential

of
computational

were
evaluated
on

a
potential
explanation
of
these
results
is
the
difficulties
in
the
transfer
of
learning
from

to
mathematics
computational

ct
is
seen
as
an
important
competence
that
is
required
in

the
future
however
educators
especially
k-12
teachers
and

have
not
clearly
identified
how
to
teach
it
in
this
study
a
meta-review
of

it
was
also
found
that
ct
has
mainly
been
applied
to
the
activities
of
program
design
and
computer
science
while
some
studies
are
related
to
other
subjects
meanwhile
most
of
the
studies
adopted
project-based_learning
problem-based_learning
cooperative_learning
and
game-based_learning
in
the
ct
activities
in
other
words
such
activities
as
aesthetic
experience
design-based_learning
and
storytelling
have
been
relatively
less
frequently
adopted
most
of
the
studies
focused
on
programming
skills
training
and
mathematical
computing
while
some
adopted
a
cross-domain
teaching
mode
to
enable
students
to
manage
and
analyze
materials
of
various
domains
by
computing
in
addition
since
the
cognitive
ability
of
students
of
different
ages
varies
the
ct
ability
cultivation
methods
and
content
criteria
should
vary
accordingly
moreover
most

more
than
just

it
exposes
students
to
computational

which
involves
problem-solving
using
computer
science
concepts
like
abstraction
and
decomposition
even
for
non-computing
majors
computational
thinking
is
applicable
and
useful
in
their
daily
lives
the
three
dimensions
of
computational
thinking
are
computational_concepts
computational
practices
and
computational
perspectives
in
recent
years
the
availability
of
free
and
user-friendly
programming
languages
has
fuelled
the
interest
of
researchers
and
educators
to
explore
how
computational
thinking
can
be
introduced
in
k-12
contexts
through
an
analysis
of
27
available

this
paper
presents
the
current
trends
of
empirical
research
in
the
development
of
computational
thinking
through
programming
and
suggests
possible
research
and
instructional
implications
from
the
review
we
propose
that
more
k-12
intervention
studies
centering
on
computational
practices
and
computational
perspectives
could
be
conducted
in
the
regular
classroom
to
better
examine
these
two
dimensions
students
could
be
asked
to
verbalize
their
thought
process
using
think
aloud
protocol
while
programming
and
their
on-screen
programming
activity
could
be
captured
and
analyzed
predetermined
categories
based
on
both
past
and
recent
programming
studies
could
be
used
to
guide
the
analysis
of
the
qualitative
data
as
for
the
instructional
implication
it
is
proposed
that
a
constructionism-based
problem-solving
learning
environment
with
information
processing
scaffolding
and
reflection
activities
could
be
designed
to
foster
computational
practices
and
computational
perspectives
one
of
the
most
important
challenges
of
education
is
the
formation
of
proper
computational
thinking
ct
in
line
with
k-12
computer
science
framework
k12csorg
the
term
of
ct
refers
to
the
“thought
processes
involved
in
expressing
solutions
as
computational
steps
or
algorithms
that
can
be
carried
out
by
a
computer”
ct
is
a
problem_solving
process
essential
to
the
development
of
computer
applications
but
it
is
also
used
in
supporting
problem_solving
across
many
other
disciplines
it
has
gained
some
grounds
in
secondary_education
in
the
last
few
years
and
there
are
ongoing
efforts
to
introduce
it
to
elementary
education
as
well
taking
into
consideration
that
algorithms
play
a
central
role
in
computational
thinking
the
aim
of
our
research
was
to
assess
the
skills
of
secondary_school
students
and
university
students
in
this
area
ct
that
they
faced
an
apparently
computer
science
–
free
task
but
with
obvious
algorithmic
background
according
to
the
aims
of
our
research
there
were
two
target
populations
secondary_school
students
and
university
students
in
order
to
measure
the
level
of
computational
thinking
we
elaborated
a
worksheet
test
with
problems
to
be
solved
the
tasks
contained
algorithms
that
can
be
applied
on
computer
and
they
did
not
need
any
it
knowledge
only
structured
and
logical_thinking
the
results
provide
a
reliable
guide
regarding
those
cognitive
skills
among
secondary_school-children
and
university
students
which
need
improvement
so
transfer
of
knowledge
could
work
in
practical
life-like
situations
current
trends
demonstrate
that
researchers
and
k-12
educators
are
moving
towards
integrating
computational
thinking
ct
concepts
outside
of
the
computer
science
cs
classroom
lee
et

2020
however
one
of
the
present
challenges
includes
a
lack
of
engaging
learning
content
and
instruction
for
translating
computational_concepts
that
non-cs
instructors
can
bring
into
their
classrooms
our
research
team
developed
the
grove-blockly
platform
a
website
that
employs
block-based
programming
and
physical
computing
elements
with
simulations
to
support
ct
learning
and
iot
practices
we
designed
a
5-day
workshop
with
the
national
writing
project
for
students
to
engage
in
steam
learning
through
making
and
creative
writing
by
examining
students’
learning
through
the
processes
and
outcomes
of
making
coding
and
creative
writing
we
aim
to
better
understand
how
learning
occurs
at
the
intersections
of
making
writing
and
computing
the
findings
show
students’
positive
learning
outcomes
of
ct
and
physical
computing
from
the
workshop
mainly
students
gained
a
deeper
understanding
of
iot
elements
eg
sensors
actuators
through
the
process
of
making
and
creative
writing
this
work
provides
empirical
evidence
on
how
students
learn
ct
and
computational
practices
through
making
and
creative

finally
we
discuss
how
the
engagement

practices
supports
and
empowers
students’
learning
of

physical
computing
through
the
creation
of
e-crafts
by
students
computational
thinking
has
become
an
important
issue
in
the
field
of
education
because
preschool
and
kindergarten
learners
are
capable
of
exercising
their
cognitive
abilities
to
resolve
basic
computational
logic
this
demographic
has
raised
significant
interest
in
studying
their
learning
intentions
and
behaviors
however
prior
research
fails
to
examine
the
effects
of
teaching
computational
logic
to
kindergarten
children
therefore
this
study
aims
to
investigate
the
influences
of
teaching
approaches
in
guiding
preschool
children
to
learn
computational
logic
and
programming
concepts
to
enhance
their
problem-solving
skills
as
well
as
computational
thinking
abilities
a
novel
teaching
framework
is
designed
to
develop
the
learner’s
cognitive
abilities
which
adopts
the
smart
toy
game-based_learning
approach
along
with
a
tangible
user
interface
tui
to
enhance
children’s
learning
performance
and
interests
the
proposed
teaching
approach
integrates
the
game-based_learning
concepts
into
the
tui
system
where
the
learning
processes
allow
the
learners
to
effectively
practice
the
conceptual
knowledge
and
efficiently
advance
their
problem-solving
skills
the
results
suggest
using
the
developed
game-based
tui
system
can
increase
preschool
children’s
learning
behaviors
as
well
as
enhance
their
learning
interests
and
computational
thinking
abilities
introducing
digital
literacy
dl
including
computational
thinking
ct
to
young
children
develops
foundational
skills
in
computer
science
problem-solving
and
critical_thinking
however
current
digital
toys
for
demonstrating
computational
thinking
strategies
are
not
always
designed
for
early-year
environments
or
specifically
for
young
preschool
children
digital
manipulatives
incorporating
embedded
computation
can
offer
developmentally
appropriate
tools
to
introduce
foundational
programming
strategies
and
dynamic
system
knowledge
before
children
become
developmentally
ready
for
more
formalised
programming
activities
this
paper
presents
an
empirical
study
in
a
preschool
environment
with
children
aged
3–5
years
using
novel
digital
manipulatives
embeddables
in
child-led
free
and
guided
play
activities
in
a
preschool
fig

from
our
analysis
of
the
types
of
activities
the
children
engaged
in
we
identified
underexplored
design
features
of
digital
manipulatives
that
can
build
early
exposure
to
ct
skills
through
ludic
and
epistemic
play
these
are
designed-in

although
the
importance
of
computational
thinking
ct
for
children
is
increasingly
recognized
its
adoption
in
computing
education
curricula
in
primary
schools
is
limited
by
several
open
challenges
including
teachers’
training
and
curricula
development
seeking
to
systematize
a
process
that
enables
primary_school
teachers
to
teach
ct
through
computing
education
in
primary
schools
we
present
the
design
evaluation
and
analysis
of
an
introductory
coding
course
for
4th-grade
classes
in
a
large
italian
city
utilizing
the
scratch
platform
the
course
followed
a
project-based_learning
approach
empowering
groups
of
children
in
designing
and
implementing
simple
video
games
and
explored
the
adoption
of
a
collaborative
strategy
through
which
computing
experts
class
teachers
and
high-school
tutors
proactively
supported
the
project
work
we
evaluated
and
refined
the
course
educational
strategies
by
conducting
an
observational
study
and
co-designing
activities
with
the
involved
teachers
then
we
derived
an
educational
model
that
may
allow
k-12
teachers
and
experts
to
collaborate
in
designing
and
implementing
computing
education
courses
that
are
engaging
inclusive
and
supportive
problem_solving
capabilities
have
often
been
reported
by
teachers
as
a
key
benefit
from
creative
coding
activities
in
school-age
children
however
few
studies
to
date
have
defined
problem_solving
and
investigated
how
it
is
operationalised
in
interdisciplinary
creative
coding
tasks
this
study
aims
to
build
knowledge
about
students’
use
of
computational
thinking
and
computer
science
concepts
for
problem_solving
when
coding
animated
narratives
the
research
investigated
students’
coding
processes
using
data
gathered
from
audio
and
device
display
recordings
and
semi-structured
interviews
results
suggest
limitations
to
the
use
of
creative
coding
tasks
if
the
expectation
is
to
develop
computational
thinking
and
systematic
problem_solving
strategies
or
learn
basic
computer
science
concepts
they
revealed
that
novice
students
rarely
solved
coding
problems
using
optimal
technically-based
strategies
despite
being
given
explicit
instruction
on
their
use
opting
instead
to
bypass
problems
by
adjusting
intended
outcomes
or
by
using
low
level
code
translation
strategies
results
demonstrate
that
engaging
computational
thinking
or
even
demonstrating
understanding
of
basic
computer
science
concepts
was
not
a
requirement
to
produce
a
viable
creative
coding
outcome
this
study
contributes
new
understanding
of
students’
coding
practices
when
engaged
in
creative
coding
tasks
in
regular
non-specialist
classrooms
its
findings
challenge
the
commonly-held
assumption
that
coding
is
a
natural
‘vehicle’
to
develop
computational
thinking
and
systematic
approaches
to
problem_solving
it
also
questions
the
learning
that
results
from
the
non-technical
inefficient
and
often
ineffective
problem_solving
practices
students
employ
during
‘creative
coding’
tasks
that
are
frequently
used
by
non-specialist
teachers
in
response
to
curriculum
requirements
owing
to
their
ease
of
engagement
and
motivational
nature
especially
for
younger
age
groups
games
have
been
omnipresent
in
education
since
earliest
times
more
recently
computer
video
games
have
become
widely
used
particularly
in
secondary
and
tertiary
education
to
impart
core
knowledge
in
some
subject
areas
and
as
an
aid
to
attracting
and
retaining
students
academics
have
proposed
a
number
of
approaches
using
games-based
learning
gbl
to
impart
theoretical
and
applied
knowledge
especially
in
the
computer
science
discipline
our
research
is
concerned
with
the
design
of
an
innovative
educational
game
framework
focused
on
the
development
of
computational
thinking
ct
skills
and
herein
we
introduce
a
serious
game
based
on
our
framework
which
encourages
the
development
of
ct
skills
to
facilitate
learning
introductory
computer
programming
we
describe
how
a
limited
number
of
key
introductory
computer
programming
concepts
have
been
mapped
onto
the
game-play
and
how
an
equivalent
set
of
skills
characterising
ct
can
be
acquired
through
playing
the
game
a
survey
response
group
of
25
students
following
computer
science
and
related
degree
programmes
but
with
very
diverse
backgrounds
and
experience
provided
initial
usability
feedback
on
the
game
their
feedback
confirmed
that
they
found
the
game
enjoyable
and
also
universally
believed
that
this
approach
would
be
beneficial
in
helping
students
learn
problem-solving
skills
for
introductory
computer
programming
feedback
from
this
group
will
be
incorporated
in
a
revised
version
of
the
game
which
will
now
be
subject
to
rigorous
experimental
evaluation
and
analysis
to
provide
structured
empirical
evidence
in
support
of
our
approach
computational
thinking
has
become
an
increasingly
popular
notion
in
k-12
and
college
level
education
although
researchers
have
accepted
that
abstraction
is
a
central
concept
in
computational
thinking
they
are
quick
to
disagree
on
the
meaning
of
it
a
focus
on
reflective
abstraction
has
led
to
the
development
of
apos
theory
in
mathematics
education
this
has
resulted
in
many
cases
of
improved

our
main
aim
in
this
paper
is
to
construct
a
theoretical
bridge
between
computational
thinking
and
apos
theory
and
show
that
reflective
abstraction
can
be
used
in
the
context
of
computational
thinking
the
use
of
educational
robotics
for
programming
education
has
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
fostering
students’
computational
thinking
ct
skills
however
physical
educational
robots
are
expensive
which
may
limit
their
wide
use
in
the
classroom
this
study
used
augmented
reality
technology
to
develop
a
virtual
educational
robotic
system
ar
bot
for
short
which
offers
3d
visual
learning
feedback
to
strengthen
spatial
ability
as
well
as
delayed
feedback
and
auto-scoring
feedback
to
promote
students’
deeper
ct
processes
to
examine
the
impact
of
ar
bot
on
programming
learning
this
study
used
a
quasi-experimental
design
to
compare
an
experimental
group
of
41
first-year
university
students
who
used
ar
bot
and
a
control
group
of
34
first-year
university
students
who
used
scratch
we
assessed
the
impact
of
the
two
ct
tools
on
students’
internal
learning
processes
enjoyment
of
learning
ct
skills
problem
decomposition
algorithm
design
and
algorithm
efficiency
skills
and
academic
achievement
the
results
showed
that
students
who
used
ar
bot
had
higher
enjoyment
of
learning
algorithm
design
skills
and
algorithm
efficiency
skills
but
not
higher
problem
decomposition
skills
and
academic
achievement
than
students
who
used

enjoyment
of

led
to
higher
problem

not
academic

problem
decomposition
and
algorithm

led
to

the
theoretical
and
practical
implications
of
the
proposed
tool
and
other
ct
tools
in
programming
education
are
discussed
we
believe
that
children
as
young
as
ten
can
directly
benefit
from
opportunities
to
engage
in
computational
thinking
one
approach
to
provide
these
opportunities
is
to
focus
on
social
game
play
understanding
game
play
is
common
across
a
range
of
media
and
ages
children
can
begin
by
solving
puzzles
on
paper
continue
on
game
boards
and
ultimately
complete
their
solutions
on
computers
through
this
process
learners
can
be
guided
through
increasingly
complex
algorithmic_thinking
activities
that
are
built
from
their
tacit
knowledge
and
excitement
about
game
play
this
paper
describes
our
approach
to
teaching
computational
thinking
skills
without
traditional
programming—but
instead
by
building
on
children’s
existing
game
playing
interest
and
skills
we
built
a
system
called
ctarcade
with
an
initial
game
tic-tac-toe
which
we
evaluated
with
18
children
aged
10–15
the
study
shows
that
our
particular
approach
helped
young
children
to
better
articulate
algorithmic_thinking
patterns
which
were
tacitly
present
when
they
played
naturally
on
paper
but
not
explicitly
apparent
to
them
until
they
used
the
ctarcade
interface
this
paper
presents
a
teaching
methodology
mixing
elements
from
the
domains
of
music
and
informatics
as
a
key
enabling
to
expose
primary_school
pupils
to
basic
aspects
of
computational
thinking
this
methodology
is
organized
in
two
phases
exploiting
lego®
bricks
respectively
as
a
physical
tool
and
as
a
metaphor
in
order
to
let
participants
discover
a
simple
notation
encoding
several
basic
concepts
of
the
classical
musical
notation
the
related
activities
grounded
on
active
learning
theory
challenge
groups
of
students
to
solve
musical
encoding
problems
of
increasing
difficulty
computational
thinking
ct
is
receiving
growing
attention
in
educational
contexts
where
robot
coding
toys
are
becoming
a
widely
available
means
of
teaching
and
learning
early
computing
as
the
field
of
child–computer
interaction
continues
to
define
what
it
means
for
young
children
to
think
computationally
much
is
unknown
about
the
affective
dimensions
of
children’s
interactions
with
computers
for
example
how
children
care
for
materials
like
coding
robots
and
how
they
establish
social
responsibility
in
computational
environments
this
paper
examines
these
questions
in
the
context
of
an
early
childhood
coding
curriculum
designed
to
support
ct
in
kindergarten
children’s
talk
and
interactions
with
robots
provide
insight
into
how
they
were
learning
to
care
for
and
maintain
robots
when
they
malfunctioned
drawing
together
feminist
perspectives
on
computing
constructionism
and
care
we
develop
a
notion
of
a
technological
ethic
of
care
and
locate
this
in
children’s
early
coding
experiences
through
critical
discourse
analysis
we
present
two
cases
where
groups
of
children
interacted
with
each
other
their
teachers
and
a
robot
called
cubetto
establishing
forms
of
responsibility
for
technology
we
argue
that
an
ethic
of
care
must
be
part
of
computational
discourses
in
an
era
of
climate
change
where
caring
for
technologies
and
keeping
them
in
working
order
is
key
to
sustainable
socio-ecological
relations
a
five-day
hands-on
workshop
was
held
at

although
three
software

were
employed

this

reports
on
the

of
celldesigner
in

conclude
celldesigner
to
be

while

it

clarifies
this
issue
by
synthesizing
the

moreover
we
propose

the

this
chapter
introduces
the
concept

it
first
reviews
the
main
goals
of
parallel

it
then
discusses
the
thinking
process
of
algorithm
selection
and
problem
decomposition
for
a
given
problem
the
programmer
will
typically
have
to
select
from
a
variety
of
algorithms
some
of
these
algorithms
achieve
different

however
considering

an
8-week

were
used
as
the

the

show
that

is
a
more

to
improve
7th-graders’

these

computational

ct
is
broadly
recognised
as
a
set
of
problem-solving
methods
that
involve
expressing
problems
and
their
solutions
in
ways
that
enable
their
computer-mediated
representation
across
a
variety
of
fields
nowadays
it
is
argued
that
ct
needs
to
be
expanded
towards
new
pathways
that
establish
a
less
individualistic
and
more
social
ct
one
of
these
pathways
consists
of
modifying
and
sharing
versions
of
projects
that
other
members
of
the
community
have
created
but
few
researchers
have
investigated
how
it
might
be
applied
to

in
this

we
aimed
to
address
the

the
results
of
the

suggest
that
our
instructional

and
especially
game
remixing
activities
can
improve
students’
reusing
and
remixing
proficiency
however
students
modify
different
ct

when
they
remix

computational

ct
is
being
consolidated
as
a
key
set
of
problem-solving
skills
that
must
be
developed
by
the
students
to
excel
in
our
software-driven
society
however
in
psychological
terms
ct
is
still
a
poorly
defined
construct
given
that
its
nomological
network
has
not
been
established
yet
in
a
previous
paper
we
started
to
address
this
issue
studying
the
correlations
between
ct
and
some
fundamental
cognitive
variables
such
as
primary
mental
abilities
and
problem-solving
ability
the
current
work
deepens
in
the
same
direction
as
it
aims
to
extend
the
nomological
network
of
ct
with
non-cognitive
factors
through
the
study
of
the
correlations
between
ct
self-efficacy

the
several

the
‘big

which

overall
our
findings
corroborate
the
existence

of

that
should
be
taken
into

by

as
a
final

the

depicted
a
growing
body

emerged
the
last

but
there
is
still
a
lack
of

about
the

there
are
also
gaps
in
the
understanding
of
how
young

with
this

we
contribute
to
the

by
taking
an

are
becoming
essential
in
all
aspects
of
work

and
ct
has
become
part
of
the
k-12
curriculum
around
the
world
yet
more
research
is
needed
to
better
understand
how
to
help
elementary_school

effectively
the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
examine
the
effectiveness
of
partial
pair_programming
ppp
on
elementary_school
students
ct
skills
and
self-efficacy
se
the
study
included
four
4th
grade
classes
with
a
total
of
171
students
who
were
taking
the
course
entitled
“computational
thinking
with
scratch”
with
the
same
teacher
for
one
semester
two
classes
84
students
were
in
the
experimental
group
eg
44
boys
and
40
girls
while
two
other
classes
87
students
were
in
the
control
group
cg
45
boys
and
42
girls
the
students
in
the
eg
were
paired
up
for
the
programming
assignments
while
the
students
in
the
cg
did
the
assignments
on
their
own
the
results
showed
that
the
students
in
the
eg
improved
their
ct
skills
and
se
more
significantly
than
those
in
the
cg
group
there
was
a
low
correlation
between
ct
and
se
in
the
post-test
of
both
groups
the
interviews
with
the
teacher
and
the
students
afterwards
provided
insights
in
understanding
the
results
the
findings
suggest
that
in
k-12
programming
teachers
could
use
ppp
as
an
effective
approach
to
improve
students’
ct
skills
programming
se
and
beyond
nowadays
many
fields
of
science
and
engineering
are
evolving
through
the
joint
contribution
of
complementary
fields
computer
science
and
especially
high
performance
computing
has
become
a
key
factor
in
the
development
of
many
research
fields
establishing
a
new
paradigm
called
computational
science
researchers
and
professionals
from
many
different
fields
require
knowledge
of
high
performance
computing
including
parallel
programming
to
develop
fruitful
and
efficient
work
in
their
particular
field
therefore
at
universitat
autònoma
of
barcelona
spain
an
interdisciplinary
master
on
“modeling
for
science
and
engineering”
was
started
5
years
ago
to
provide
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
application
of
modeling
and
simulation
to
graduate
students
in
different
fields
mathematics
physics
chemistry
engineering
geology
etc
in
this
master’s
degree
“parallel
programming”
appears
as
a
compulsory
subject
because
it
is
a
key
topic
for
them
the
concepts
learned
in
this
subject
must
be
applied
to
real
applications
therefore
a
complementary
subject
on
“applied
modeling
and
simulation”
has
also
been
included
it
is
very
important
to
show
the
students
how
to
analyze
their
particular
problems
think
about
them
from
a
computational
perspective
and
consider
the
related
performance
issues
so
in
this
paper
the
methodology
and
the
experience
in
introducing
computational
thinking
parallel
programming
and
performance
engineering
in
this
interdisciplinary
master’s
degree
are
shown
this
overall
approach
has
been
refined
through
the
master’s
life
leading
to
excellent
academic
results
and
improving
the
industry
and
students
appraisal
of
this
programme
collaboration
and
engagement
while
coding
are
vital
elements
for
children
yet
very
little
is
known
about
how
children’s
engagement
and
collaboration
impact
their
attitudes
toward
coding
activities
the
goal
of
the
study
is
to
investigate
how
collaboration
and
engagement
moderate
children’s
attitudes
about
coding
activities
to
do
so
we
designed
an
study
with
44
children
between
8
and
17
years
old
who
participated
in
a
full-day
coding
activity
we
measured
their
engagement
and
collaboration
during
the
activity
by
recording
their
gaze
and
their
attitudes
in
relation
to
their
learning
enjoyment
team-work
and
intention
by
post-activity
survey
instruments
our
analysis
shows
that
there
is
a
significant
moderating
effect
of
collaboration
and
engagement
on
children’s
attitudes
in
other
words
highly
engaging
and
collaborative
coding
activities
significantly
moderate
children’s
attitudes
our
findings
highlight
the
importance
of
designing
highly
collaborative
and
engaging
coding
activities
for
children
and
quantifies
how
those
two
elements
moderate
children’s
attitudes
this

it
comments
on
the
expansion
of

in
the
technological
age
to
embrace

it
then
defines
ten
literacies
that

for
the
future
with
specific

ai
the
relevance
of

ct
is
considered
an
emerging
competence
domain
linked
to
21st-century
competences
and
educational
robotics
er
is
increasingly
recognised
as
a
tool
to
develop
ct
competences
this
is
why
researchers
recommend
developing
intervention
methods
adapted
to
classroom
practice
and
providing
explicit
guidelines
to
teachers
on
integrating
er
activities
the
present
study
thus
addresses
this
challenge
guidance
and
feedback
were
considered
as
critical
intervention
methods
to
foster
ct
competences
in
er
settings
a
between-subjects
experiment
was
conducted
with
66
students
aged
8
to
9
in
the
context
of
a
remote
collaborative
robot
programming
mission
with
four
experimental
conditions
a
two-step
strategy
was
employed
to
report
students
ct
competence
their
performance
and
learning
process
firstly
the
students
ct
learning
gains
were
measured
through
a
pre-post-test
design
secondly
video
analysis
was
used
to
identify
the
creative
computational
problem-solving
patterns
involved
in
the
experimental
condition
that
had
the
most
favourable
impact
on
the
students’
ct
scores
results
show
that
delayed
feedback
is
an
effective
intervention
method
for
ct
development
in
er
activities
subject
to
delayed
feedback
students
are
better
at
formulating
the
robot
behaviour
to
be
programmed
and
thus
such
a
strategy
reinforces
the
anticipation

underlying
the
ct
this
study
conducts
a
systematic
review
of
the

we
selected
articles
published
in
peer-reviewed
journals
that
focused
on
both
cognitive
and
affective
aspects
of
computational
thinking
and
cs
education
at
the
primary
and
secondary
levels
a
total
of
29
studies
were
reviewed
and
their
findings
were
synthesized
to
assess
the
status
of
gender

contributing
factors
and

approaches
the
results
indicated
that
gender
differences
in
cognitive
and
affective
dimensions
of
cs
education
become
more
evident
as
students
advance
through
school
with
a
greater
negative

the
review
identified
three
interconnected
factors
contributing
to
these

individual
psychological
factors
additionally
the

in
helping
adult

with
a

where
those

are
required
for
many
parts
of
the

however
there
is
an
agreement
in
the
scientific

that
important
challenges
exist
such
as
keeping
student
engagement
and
the
requirement
of
developing

has
shown
great
potential
to
better
understand
how
it
can
be
helpful
to
adult

a
study
was
conducted
on
the
application
of
two
very
popular
commercial
video
games
in
different
introductory
programming
courses
at
an
online
university
during
the
introduction

the
methods
combined
a
descriptive
qualitative
and
a
quantitative
approach
using
a
reflective
journals
and
questionnaires
which
helped
students
consider
and
express
their
experiences
how
they
interacted
with
the
games
how
the
games
helped
them
better
understand
the
topics
and
realize
their
personal
progress
and
potential
results
showed
that
the
use
of
these
games
as
educational
resources
had
a
positive
impact
in
their
engagement
and
sense
of
self-efficacy
but
only
if
some
important
instructional
considerations
are
taken
into
account
the
inclusion
of
computational
thinking
ct
in
the
classroom
is
something
that
the
present
and
future
society
is
demanding
however
this
domain
remains
largely
unexplored
especially
in
the
first
years
of
primary_education
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
evaluate
whether
the
inclusion
of
the
so-called
unplugged_activities
favours
the
development
of
ct
in
the
students
of
the
early
years
of
primary_education
to
this
end
a
quasi-experimental
study
has
been
carried
out
to
explore
the
eventual
benefit
of
a
mixed
approach
that
combines
both
unplugged
and
plugged-in
activities
in
particular
84
second-grade
students
took
part
in
the
experiment
three
questions
were
evaluated
the
development
of
their
ct
skills
their
motivation
towards
the
proposed
instruction
and
the
influence
of

in
the
two
previous
areas
the
intervention
was
designed
on
a
selection
of
activities
extracted
from
codeorg
courses
and
was
divided
into
two
phases
one
in
which
one
group
worked
with
unplugged_activities
and
the
other
with
plugged-in
activities
and
a
second
where
both
groups
worked
with
plugged-in
activities
analysing
the
three
proposed
questions
through
tests
performed
before
in
between
and
after
the
instruction
it
is
concluded
that
the
inclusion
of
unplugged_activities
in
the
instruction
seems
beneficial
taking
into
account
ct
motivation
and
gender
in
this
study
we
evaluated
the
cognitive
and
attitudinal
influences
of
playing
a
video

designed
to
target
the
development
of
middle

ct
skills
in
addition
to
the
overall
effectiveness
of
the
game
we
investigated
the
impact
of
a
specific
game
feature—constraints
on
the
number
of
blocks
in
a
solution
results
showed
that
after
playing
penguin
go
for
less
than
two
hours
students
ct
skills
improved
significantly
but
the
additional
constraints
did
not
generate
a
significant
impact
on
learning
in
addition
the
game
overall
did
not
influence
students
attitudes
toward
computer
science
but
the
constraints
condition
of
the
game
negatively
influenced
students
attitudes
toward
computer
science
implications
of
the
findings
and
possible
directions
for
future
research
regarding
using
these
types
of
games
to
foster
computational
thinking
skills
are
discussed
as
the
definition
of
computational

continues
to
evolve
researchers
have
investigated
the
integration
of

in
k-12
learning
contexts
and
students
perceptions
and
development
of
ct
in
these
integrated

experiences
drawing
on
prior
work
this
study
explored
the
evolution
of
two
elementary_school
girls’
conceptions
and
practices
of
ct
in
science
as
they
participated
in
a
four-week
ct-integrated
science
unit
at
a
summer
camp
using
the
dash
robot
and
the
blockly
app
three
ct

were
integrated
into
a
unit
on
the
reproduction

of
flowerless
plants
observations
participant
drawings
and
analysis
of
blockly
code
revealed
that
the
children
improved
in
their
ct
practices
in
addition
the
ct-integrated
science
unit
developed
for
this
study
successfully
engaged
both
participants
even
when
one
expressed
a
low
interest
in
science
the
study
suggested
that
defining
computing
vocabulary
using
checkpoint
activities
with
immediate
and
corrective
feedback
and
scaffolding
of
coding
concepts
with
unplugged_activities
were
particularly
necessary
in
promoting
ct
and
the
integration
of
ct
and
science
education
in
an
elementary-level
informal
learning
context
this
study
compared
the
pedagogical
effects
of
educational
robot
development
and
the
block-based
programming
perspectives
which
are
used
in
programming
education
on
middle
school
students
its
participants
were
78
sixth

considering
the
students’
preferences
38
students
were
assigned
to
the
experimental
group
which
studied
with
robotics
lego
ev3
sets
and
40
students
were
assigned
to
the
control
group
which
studied
with
block-based
programming
environment

all
the
topics
of
the
programming
unit
which
are
shown
in
the
methods
section
were
taught
to
both
groups
for
10
weeks
using
the
two
different
approaches
the
change
created
by
the
implementation
between
the
groups
was
tested
for
academic
achievement
computational
thinking
skill
efficacy
perceptions
and
conceptual
knowledge
levels
the
results
indicate
that
educational
robotics
develop
middle
school
students’
academic
achievement
and
computational
thinking
skill
efficacy
perceptions
more
effectively
than
block-based
programming
environments
the
connections
between
the
concepts
of
the
students
who
did
robotics
were
also
found
to
be
more
solid
than
those
who
worked
with
block-based
software
as
computational
thinking
ct
is
being
embraced
by
educational
systems
worldwide
researchers
and
teachers
have
posed
important
questions
such
as
“what
to
teach”
and
“what
can
be
learned”
these
questions
are
universally
crucial
to
the
learning
of
all
subjects
nevertheless
there
is
no
up-to-date
systematic
overview
of
ct
education
for
k-9
students
that
attempt
to
provide
answers
to
these
crucial
questions
thus
this
systematic
review
presents
a
synthesis
of
55
empirical
studies
providing
evidence
of
the
development
of
computational
thinking
through
programming
in
scratch
one
of
the
most
popular
visual
block_programming
languages
in
schools
the
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
systematically
examine
the
ct
skills
that
can
be
obtained
through
scratch
in
k-9
based
on
empirical
evidence
this
systematic
review
has
adopted
brennan
and
resnicks
2012
framework
as
the
basis
for
defining
and
identifying
the
expected
ct
skills
in
k-9
the
major
findings
entail
what
computational
thinking
skills
students
in
k-9
can
learn
through
scratch
in
relation
to
the
framework
mentioned
above
taking
the
progression
of
learning
into
account
additional
ct
skills
that
are
not
captured
by
the
framework
were
identified
including
inputoutput
reading
interpreting
and
communicating
code
using
multimodal
media
predictive
thinking
and
human-computer
interaction
these
additional
ct
skills
are
not
currently
presented
in
brennan
and
resnicks
2012
framework
and
can
be
considered
as
possible
supplements
to
their
framework
furthermore
the
paper
discusses
the
difficulties
regarding
assessment
and
the
progression
of
the
identified
skills
as
well
as
problems
with
study
designs
finally
the
paper
sets
out
suggestions
for
future
studies
based
on
the
current
research
gaps
the
study
examined
the
effects
of
learning
with
the
bee-bot
on
young
boys
and
girls
computational
thinking
within
the
context
of
two
scaffolding
techniques
the
study
reports
statistically
significant
learning
gains
between
the
initial
and
final
assessment
of
childrens
computational
thinking
skills
also
according
to
the
findings
while
both
boys
and
girls
benefited
from
the
scaffolding
techniques
a
statistically
significant
interaction
effect
was
detected
between
gender
and
scaffolding
strategy
showing
that
boys
benefited
more
from
the
individualistic
kinesthetic
spatially-oriented
and
manipulative-based
activity
with
the
cards
while
girls
benefited
more
from
the
collaborative
writing
activity
in
regards
to
the
childrens
problem-solving
strategies
during
debugging
the
results
showed
that
the
majority
of
them
used
decomposition
as
a
strategy
to
deal
with
the
complexity
of
the
task
these
results
are
important
because
they
show
that
children
at
this
very
young
age
are
able
to
cope
with
the
complexity
of
a
learning
task
by
decomposing
it
into
a
number
of
subtasks
that
are
easier
for
them
to
tackle
the
research
contributes
to
the
body
of
knowledge
about
the
teaching
of
computational
thinking
in
addition
the
study
has
practical
significance
for
curriculum
developers
instructional
leaders
and
classroom
teachers
as
they
can
use
the
results
of
this
study
to
design
curricula
and
classroom
activities
with
a
focus
on
the
broader
set
of
computational
thinking
skills
and

the
pedagogical
foundation
of

that
is
putting
developmentally-appropriate
powerful

a
computational

is
proposed
the
computational

is
a
parametric
construction
that
takes
into
account
cognitive
stages

transitions
between

the
cognitive
model
enables
the

based
on
the
notion
of

in
this
world
of
the
digital
era
in
which
we
are
living
one
of
the
fundamental
competences
that
students
must
acquire
is
the
competence
in
computational
thinking
ct
although
there
is
no
general
consensus
on
a
formal
definition
there
is
a
general
understanding
of
it
as
a
set
of
skills
and
attitudes
necessary
for
the
resolution
with
or
without
a
computer
of
problems
that
may
arise
in
any
area
of

measuring
and
evaluating
which
of
the
ct
skills
students
have
acquired
is
fundamental
and
for
this
purpose
previously
validated
measuring

must
be
used
in
this

a

is
applied
to

this
paper
introduces
the
dpgraphj
package
a
collection
of
reusable
java

to
solve

problems
using
a
dynamic

algorithm
the
latter
is
based
on
a
recursive
schema
that
follows
a
top-down
approach
and
uses
the
memoisation
technique
this
algorithm
is
a
reusable
software
component
that
is
generic
and
efficient
moreover
it
has
been
developed
by
paying
special
attention
to
good
practices
in
the

we
provide
5

strongly
believe
that
our
proposal
can
be
helpful
for
several

significantly
with
operating

costing
approximately

36

efficient
scheduling
is
vital
however
global
practices
in
surgical
scheduling
vary
largely
due
to
challenges
in
predicting
individual
surgeon
times
for
diverse
patient
conditions
inspired
by
the
toyota
production
system’s
efficiency
in
addressing
similar
logistical
challenges
we
applied
its
principles
as
detailed
in
the
book
“lean

by
womack
and
jones
which
identifies
processes
that
do
not
meet

is
critical
in

this

aims
to
use
lean

and
toyota
methods
to
develop
a
more
efficient
surgical
scheduling
system
that
better
aligns
with
user
needs
without
additional
financial
burdens
methods
we
implemented
the
5
principles
of
the
toyota
system
specifying

value
was
defined
in
terms
of
meeting
the
customer’s
needs
which
in
this
context
involved
developing
a
responsive
and
efficient
scheduling
system
our
approach
included
2
subsystems
one
handling
presurgery
patient
data
and
another
for
intraoperative
and
postoperative
data
we
identified
inefficiencies
in
the
presurgery
data
subsystem
and
responded
by
creating
a
comprehensive
value
stream
map
of
the
surgical
process
we
developed
2
excel
microsoft
corporation
macros
using
visual
basic
for
applications
the
first
calculated
average
surgery
times
from
intra-
or
postoperative
historic
data
while
the
second
estimated
surgery
durations
and
generated
concise
visually
engaging
scheduling
reports
from
presurgery
data
we
assessed
the
effectiveness
of
the
new
system
by
comparing
task
completion
times
and
user
satisfaction
between
the
old
and
new
systems
results
the
implementation
of
the
revised

system
significantly
reduced
the
overall

time
from
301

we
report
on
the

specifically
we
detail
a

with
reasonable

we
give
an
account
of
our
use
of

to
investigate
how
introducing
computational

eye
tracking
is
one
of
the
techniques
used
to
investigate
cognitive
mechanisms
involved
in
the
school
context
such
as
joint
attention
and
visual

furthermore
the
ongoing
software
enhancements
coupled
with
the
implementation
of
artificial

algorithms
have
improved
the
precision
of
collecting
eye
movement
data
and
simplified
the

process
these
characteristics
make
it
plausible
to
consider
eye-tracking
technology
a
promising
tool
to
assist
the
teaching-learning
process
in

routines
however
eye

needs
to
be
explored
more
as
an

this
perspective
article
briefly
presents
the
fundamentals
of
the
eye-tracking
technique
and
four
illustrative
examples
of
employing
this
method
in

shows
how

may
contribute
to

thus
we
highlight
the
potential
of
the
eye

in
conclusion
we
suggest
that
an

scp
is
highly
considered
for
its

however
there
is
a
noticeable
gap
in

this

delves
into

by
introducing
a
three-level
conceptual

how
the

is
mediated
through
the

approach
simultaneously
explores
scp
within
the
intricate
school
environment
where
factors
at
the
school
teacher
and

are
closely
intertwined

and
their
2433

results
indicate
that
the

recommendations
for
future
research
are
discussed
we
describe
a
new
course
designed
to
introduce
engineering
students
to
computational
thinking
one
of
the
most
significant
challenges
in
teaching
an
introductory-level
applied
computing
course
is
that
students
are
not
expected
to
have
substantial
math
and
science
experience
to
address
this
we
have
developed
exercises
which
use
edge
detection
and
basic
image
processing
to
motivate
the
use
of
programming
matlab
in
a
non-trivial
scientific
application
matlab
is
a
popular
high-level
programming
language
and
environment
which
supports
a
wide
range
of
computational
science
applications
matlab
has
strong
support
for
operating
on
image
data
which
allows
us
to
balance
solving
practical
engineering
problems
with
basic
core
concepts
of
computer
science
such
as
functional
abstraction
conditional
execution
and
iteration
recognized
as
the
crown
jewel
of
system
software
operating
system
os
is
notoriously
challenging
to
teach
and
learn
given
its
abstract
concepts
broad
scope
and
the
imperative
for
hands-on
experience
how
to
cater
to
the
keen
interest
in
os
among
students
across
all
universities
while
providing
a
rich
system
software
engineering
experience
engaging
the
os
community
on
campus
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
enhancing
undergraduate
education
our
institution
has
implemented
a
novel
approach
over
the
past
nine
years
through
the
minios
pilot
class
initiative
this
program
allows
students
enrolled
in
the
os
course
to
opt
into
an
additional
practical
component
where
they
engage
in
developing
the
os
kernel
using
minios
our
teaching
platform
participants
dedicate
their
spare
time
to
a
series
of
labs
aimed
at
incrementally
introducing
them
to
minios
collaborate
on
a
project
to
add
a
new
functional
module
to
minios
and
ultimately
present
their
work
in
a
formal
defense
this
hands-on
experience
supplements
the
theoretical
coursework
with
the
notable
advantage
that
pilot
class
participants
are
exempt
from
the
traditional
final
exam
instead
their
grade
is
determined
by
their
contributions
to
the
pilot
class
with
distinguished
projects
being
integrated
into
the
evolving
minios
kernel—a
witness
to
the
collective
effort
of
each
class
since
its
inception
in
2015
the
minios
pilot
class
has
nurtured
182
undergraduates
and
22
graduate
students
contributing
significantly
to
the
os
community
engagement
on
campus
through
this
initiative
we
have
gleaned
six
key
insights
and
six
lessons
which
we
are
eager
to
share
with
the
broader
educational
community
several
automation
tools
have
been
developed
over
the
years
for
forensic
document
examination
fde
of
handwritten
items
integrating
the
developed
tools
into
a
unified
framework
is
considered
and
the
essential
role
of
the
human
in
the
process
is
discussed
the
task
framework
is
developed
by
considering
the
approach
of
computational
thinking
whose
components
are
abstraction
algorithms
mathematical
models
and
ability
to
scale
beginning
with
the
human
fde
procedure
expressed
in
algorithmic
form
mathematical
and
software
implementations
of
individual
steps
of
the
algorithm
are
described
advantages
of
the
framework
are
discussed
including
efficiency
ability
to
scale
to
tasks
with
many
handwritten
items
reproducibility
and
validationimprovement
of
existing
manual
procedures
it
is
indicated
that
as
with
other
expert
systems
such
as
for
medical
diagnosis
current
automation
tools
are
useful
only
as
part
of
a
larger
manually
intensive
procedure
this
viewpoint
is
illustrated
with
a
well-known
fde
case
concerning
the
lindbergh
kidnapping
with
a
new
hypothesis
–
in
this
case
there
are
multiple
questioned
documents
possibility
of
multiple
writers
of
the
same
document
determining
whether
the
writing
is
disguised
known
writing
is
formal
while
questioned
writing
is
informal
etc
observations
are
made
for
future
developments
where
human
examiners
provide
handwriting
characteristics
while
computational
methods
provide
the
necessary
statistical
analysis
the
mental
rotation
ability
is
an
essential
spatial
reasoning
skill
in
human
cognition
and
has
proven
to
be
an
essential
predictor
of
mathematical
and
stem
skills
critical
and
computational
thinking
despite
its
importance
little
is
known
about
when
and
how
mental
rotation
processes
are
activated
in
games
explicitly
targeting
spatial
reasoning
tasks
in
particular
the
relationship
between
spatial
abilities
and
tetristm
has
been
analysed
several
times
in
the
literature
however
these
analyses
have
shown
contrasting
results
between
the
effectiveness
of
tetris-based
training
activities
to
improve
mental
rotation
skills
in
this
work
we
studied
whether
and
under
what
conditions
such
ability
is
used
in
the
tetristm
game
by
explicitly
modelling
mental
rotation
via
an
act-r
based
cognitive
model
controlling
a
virtual
agent
the
obtained
results
show
meaningful
insights
into
the
activation
of
mental
rotation
during
game
dynamics
the
study
suggests
the
necessity
to
adapt
game
dynamics
in
order
to
force
the
activation
of
this
process
and
therefore
can
be
of
inspiration
to
design
learning
activities
based
on
tetristm
or
re-design
the
game
itself
to
improve
its
educational
effectiveness
this
paper
outlines
some
provisional
steps

a
theory

i
then
address
the
definition
of

arguing
that
culture
is
a
property
of
causal
chains
rather
than
a
thing-in-the-world
i
briefly
address
contemporary
debates
over
the
nature
of
culture—embodied
versus
embedded—and
argue
for
an
ecological
approach
in
which
culture-in-action
unfolds
as
embodied
schemas
recognize
and
produce
“handles”
in
the
environment
when
schemas
are
“objectively
adapted”
to
the
handles
they
generate
action
that
is
ecologically
rational
to
explain
ecologically
rational
culture-in-action
i
outline
a
formal
approach
to
cultural
learning
based
on
probably
approximately
correct

the

however
courses
that

are
still
scarce
in

education
this
study
aimed
to
develop
a
project-based
machine
learning
ml
course
for
the
implementation
of
ai
technology
the
core
idea
of
this
course
which
focused
on
the
supervised
learning
of
ai
ml
technology
was
designed
based
on
the
project
of

furthermore
data
collection

were
realized
using
various

were
implemented
in

a
total

68
eleventh-grade

the
following
conclusions
were
drawn
1
the
proposed

understand
the
basic
concepts
of

2
students
demonstrate
a

3
although
the

attitude
toward

ai
shows
no
significant
change
after
attending
this

their
overall
view
for

is
positive
4
contrary
to
their
learning
attitude
the
ct
skills
among
the
students
with
different
capabilities
of

ai
are
significantly
dissimilar
overall
the
machine-learning
implementation
course
developed
in
this
study
can
serve
as
a
reference
for
promoting
ai
education
in
the
future
however
considering
learners’
prior
knowledge
in
programming
setting
up
appropriate
learning
scaffolding
for
them
and
providing
them
with
more
examples
of
the
applications
of
ai
in
real-life
scenarios
is
still
necessary
when
conducting
the
course
for
improving
the
students’
attitude
toward
ai
in
this
article
we
discuss
how
mathematics
can
play
a
role
in
stem
activities
in
k–12
classrooms
from
the
perspective
of
content
we
argue
that
mathematics
serves
as
a
language
tool
to
help
representmodel
stem
activities
and
explaininterpret
identified
solutions
from
the
perspective
of
process
we
argue
that
mathematics
serves
as
a
thinking
tool
because
mathematical
reasoning
is
at
the
core
of
problem_solving
in
addition
computational
thinking
is
a
critical
skill
for
solving
problems
in
complex
systems
we
conclude
our
study
with
three
suggestions
that
help
make
mathematics
more
explicit
in
k–12
stem
classrooms
we
present
a
theory
of
the
causes
of
difficulty
in
children’s
creation
of
informal
programs
ten-year-old
children
are
able
to
devise
such
programs
to
rearrange
the
order
of
the
cars
in
trains
on
a
simple
railway
track
with
a
single
siding
according
to
the
theory
they
rely
on
kinematic
mental
models
that
simulate
the
required
sequence
of
steps
and
we
devised
a
computer
program
mabducer
which
does
so
too
in
creating
its
own
programs
for
such
rearrangements
an
experiment
showed
that
a
simple
measure
of
the
complexity
of
its
programs
based
on
kolmogorov
complexity
predicts
ten-year-olds’
difficulty
in
this
task
the
measure
is
the
number
of
words
in
mabducer’s
programs
for
solving
the
rearrangement
in
a
minimal
number
of
moves
complexity
in
turn
reflects
the
structure
of
the
required
programs
which
need
loops
of
moves
to
be
repeated
and
often
moves
before
and
after
such
a
loop
children’s
errors
are
predictable
in
both
their
location
and
nature
our
results
therefore
have
implications
for
the
assessment
and
pedagogy
of
computational
thinking
providing
computational
problems
for
enhancing
students’
abstraction
skills
and
monitoring
how
students
make
abstractions
is
difficult
in
block-based
programming
environments
bbpes
thus
concrete
examples
and
principles
are
needed
to
guide
computer
science
teachers
about
understanding
and
enhancing
students’
abstractions
this
study
aims
to
examine
the
effect
of
using
block-based
coding
environments
on
enhancing
secondary_school
students’
abstraction
skills
referring
to
the
programming
knowledge
a
rubric
was
created
to
analyze
the
data
from
screen
recordings
observation
and
interviews
were
used
together
to
reveal
the
students’
abstraction
performances
the
results
suggested
that
students
performed
high
in
elimination
focusing
and
generalization
however
students’
performances
were
relatively
low
in
customization
students’
explanations
were
mostly
related
the
nature
of
the
problems
affordances
of
bbpe
and
the
programming
constructs
used
in
coding
we
hope
the
study
will
provide
insights
for
the
efforts
on
instructional
designs
for
successful
abstraction
experiences
for
young
students
artificial

previous

have
demonstrated
that

however
there
is
a
scarcity
of

about
how
these

we
conducted
this
scoping

analyzed
17

the
existing

provide
up-to-date
insights
into

and
other

this

primary_school

presents
theoretical
and
pedagogical
challenges
despite
the
pervasive

which
can
exacerbate

primary

often
lack
an
understanding

recent

have
extended

but
ai

remain
underdeveloped
this

aims
to
conceptualize
ai

by
analyzing
existing
theoretical
frameworks
and
proposing
a
new

framework
for

a

and
19

are
selected
with
17
ai

identified
across
all
educational

from
early

this
study
reveals
that
the
predominant
methodologies
for
developing
ai

frameworks
involve
empirical
research
studies
and
literature
reviews
adhering
to
national
government
or

these

commonly
incorporate
1
blooms

framework
such
as
use-create-modify
2
constructionism
and
3
computer

perspectives
such
as

the
findings
reveal
that
ai
literacy
is
situated
at
the
intersection
of
digital

and
ai
ethics
emphasizing
the
need
for
a
transdisciplinary
and
interdisciplinary
approach
that
encompasses
both
technological
and
societal
impacts
however
the
study
argues
that
the
current
paradigms
of
ai

frameworks
for
young
students
often
emphasize
constructionist
perspectives
without
fully
considering
the
interactions
between
human

this
gap
highlights
the
necessity
for
a
new
conceptual
framework
that
acknowledges
both
human

in
ai

aimed
at
developing
an

to
identify
the
sequential

of
students
during
the
process
of
learning
with
the

was
4
weeks
spent
on

the
students
worked
in

finally
they
played
the
computational

application
they
developed
in
the

they
made
in

learned
the
application
of

in
the

while
artificial

is
becoming
a
commonplace
feature
of

have
focused
on

illustrates
the
content
and
the
process
of
teaching
where
3–9
year
old
children
were
producing
machine

data
sets
and
models
as
well
as
observing
exploring
and
explaining
their
own

systems
the
results
illustrate
the
quick-paced
and
embodied
nature
of
the
child-computer
interaction
that
also
supported
children
to
reason
about
the

between
their
own

computational

and
coding
for
children
are
attracting
increasing
attention
there
are
several
efforts
around
the
globe
to
implement
coding
frameworks
for
children
and
there
is
a
need
to
develop
an
empirical
knowledge
base
of
methods
and
tools
one
major
problem
for
integrating
study
results
into
a
common
body
of
knowledge
is
the
relatively
limited
measurements
applied
and
the
relation
of
the
widely
used
self-reporting
methods
with
more
objective
measurements
such
as
biophysical
ones
in
this
study
eye-tracking
activity
was
used
to
measure
children’s
learning
and
activity
indicators
the
goal
of
the
study
is
to
utilize
eye-tracking
to
understand
children’s
activity
while
they
learn
how
to
code
and
to
investigate
any
potential
association
between
children’s
attitudes
and
their
gaze
in
this
contribution
we
designed
an
experiment
with
44
children
between
8
and
17
years
old
who
participated
in
a
full-day
construction-based
coding
activity
we
recorded
their
gaze
while
they
were
working
and
captured
their
attitudes
in
relation
to
their
learning
excitement
and
intention
the
results
showed
a
significant
relation
between
children’s
attitudes
what
they
think
about
coding
and
their
gaze
patterns
how
they
behaved
during
coding
eye-tracking
data
provide
initial
insights
into
the
behaviour
of
children
for
example
if
children
have
difficulty
in
extracting
information
or
fail
to
accomplish
an
expected
task
therefore
further
studies
need
to
be
conducted
to
shed
additional
light
on
children’s
experience

to
understand
how
to
provide
instructional
supports
to
a
wide
range
of
learners
including

this
cross-case
analysis
study
examined
the
supports
that
two
students
with
disabilities
who
were
initially
disengaged
during
computing
activities
received
during
computing
instruction
data
revealed
that
students
support
needs
during
computing
activities
were
not
ct-specific
rather
supports
specific
to
these
students
needs
that
were
successful
in
other
educational
areas
were
also
successful
and
sufficient
in
ct
although
additional
studies
would
need
to
be
conducted
to
ascertain
the
transferability
of
these
findings
to
other
contexts
and
students
our
results
contribute
evidence
that
students
with

can
and
should
participate
in
ct
and
be
provided
with
the
supports
they
need
just
as
in
all
other
areas
of
the
curriculum
we
present
a
framework
for
evaluating
student
engagement
to
identify
student-specific
supports
and
when
needed
refine
the
emerging
k-12
ct
pedagogy
to
facilitate
full
participation
of
all
students
we
then
offer
a
list
of
four
implications
for

based
on
the
findings
over
the
last
few
years
the

the

moreover
positive

lies
in
the
theoretical

we
provide

this

in
this

we
argue
that

the

phogo
combines
python
arduino
and
3d
printing
into
a
low

robot
that
is
easy
to
build
and
control
the

has
a
pen
to
draw

and
can
be
commanded
from
a

that
is
transparent
to

the
use
of

can
make
programming
more
accessible
for

the
open

maker
philosophies
behind
phogo
makes
it
more
interesting
as
students
will
be
able
to
access

study
the

little

has
dealt
with
the
strategic
challenge
of
developing

subject
in

in
this

we
explore
how
to
develop
implement
and
sustain
a
national
program
on

comprehension
by
analyzing
the
newly
established
danish

center
for

comprehension
we
draw
on
the
concept
of
infrastructuring
to
shed
light
on
how
to
create
and
sustain
the
social
material
political
and
organizational
structures
that
form
the
basis
for
introducing
the
new
national
initiative
based
on
our
case
we
distill
seven
propositions
that
describe
more
generally
how
to
work
strategically
with
this
challenge
this
paper
advocates
for
a
future
where
the
teaching
of
math
and

are
harmoniously
intertwined
as
they
were
in
the
days
of
da

future
code
provides
the
“brush”
that
enables
the
expression
of
artistic
ideas
and
mathematical
structures
in
digital
and
digitally-fabricated
mediums
this
educational
idea
is
motivated
by
1
literature
supporting
the
position
that
visual
thinking
and
spatial
reasoning
significantly
impact
steam
disciplines
and
2
piaget’s
theory
of
cognitive
development
in
which
children
in
the
concrete
operational
stage
solve
problems
relating
to
physical
objects
ie
they
learn-by-making
a
project
is
then
described
involving
the
creation
of
a
3d
artifact
we
call
a
wunderlich
cube
—
a
mathematical
artifact
that
embodies
numerous
spatial
reasoning
puzzles
an
understanding
of
the
properties
of
the
wunderlich
cube
is
developed
through
manual
construction
using
lego®
mathematical
analysis
computational
thinking
coding
and
3d
printing
despite
growing
attention
to
the
social
and
ethical
dimensions
of
computer
science
cs
few
practical
resources
exist
to
teach
and
learn
cs
through
the
lens
of
social
responsibility
in
critically
conscious
computing
ko
and
colleagues
provide
a
comprehensive
overview
of
foundational
computing
concepts
with
a
sharp
and
needed
critical
perspective
in
this
review
we
attend
not
only
to
the
content
of
the
book
but
also
to
its
format
as
a
free
online
“living”
text
the
book
is
commendable
for
its
tight
integration
of
technical
and
socio-critical
aspects
of
computing
approachable
conversational
style
and
collection
of
flexible
and
practical
resources
for
teachers
it
would
benefit
from
refinement
of
the
integration
chapters
and
a
more
explicit
model
for
how
educators
themselves
can
approach
new
or
different
cs
concepts
through
a
critical
frame
overall
we
strongly
recommend
this
book
for
cs
educators
at
all
levels
for
its
balance
of
depth
and
practicality
block
construction
is
ubiquitous
in
early
development
yet
is
surprisingly
complex
involving
step-by-step
sequenced
actions
to
create
specific
structures
here
we
use
novel
analytic
methods
to
characterize
these
action
sequences
in
detail
including
which
individual
parts
of
the
structure
‘states’
are
built
and
how
these
structures
are
combined
creating
a
fully
specified
build
path
towards
the
final
structure
we
find
that
like
adults
tested
in
a
previous
study
4-
to
8-year-olds
build
by
creating
a
small
subset
of
possible
individual
states
and
full
build
paths
and
that
they
prioritize
building
layer-by-layer
the
individual
states
and
build
paths
that
children
produce
are
strikingly
similar
to
those
of
adults
resulting
in
structures
that
are
more
stable
than
other
possible
but
not
attested
states
and
paths
our
approach
serves
as
a
lens
into
the
cognitive
processes
underlying
block
building
and
suggests
that
children’s
building
is
guided
by
significant
cognitive
constraints
consistent
with
“computational
thinking”
pair_programming

therefore
this

aimed
to
explore
the
impact
of
two
social
factors
gender

to
that
end
we
conducted

indicated
a
there

a
significant

b
there
was
no

became
more
productive

confidence
in

and
c
pp
tightened
up

these
findings
suggest
that

should
take
partnership
into
account
as
an
important
factor
in
pp
or
other
collaborative_learning

adopt
pp
as
an

research
demonstrates
that
it
is
challenging
to
introduce

in
this
paper
we
examine
lithuanian

perceptions
of
the
barriers
and

to
integrate
the
renewed

curricula
in

and
the
relation

fifteen
semi-structured
interviews
were
conducted
with
primary_school
teachers
and
a
mixed-methods
approach
was
employed
to
analyze

the
results
show
that
explicit
guidelines
for
renewed

and
motivation
to
learn
informatics
are
both
identified
as
the
main
barriers
and
drivers
for
integrating

the
study
further
highlights
the
critical
role
of
resources
appropriate
tools
and
guidelines
in
facilitating
the
successful
implementation
of

the
study
provides
knowledge
that

and
help

can
be
better
supported
to

future
challenges
several
gaps
exist
in
the
literature
on
coding
first
little
exploration
has
focused
on
early
elementary_school
students
in
addition
close
description
of
the
overall
context
of
coding
tasks
at
this
level
is
rare
further
there
is
a
need
for
both
teacher
and
student
voices
around
coding
experiences
to
be
heard
moreover
a
task
engagement
framework
has
not
been
used
to
evaluate
the
process
or
outcomes
of
early
elementary
coding
tasks
therefore
an
exploratory
holistic
case
study
design
was
used
to
investigate
student
and
teacher
processes
and
outcomes
of
coding
lessons
in
order
to
fill
gaps
in
the
literature
in
this
study
forty-six
2nd
grade
students
two
teachers
and
four
researchers
completed
two
one-week
units
on
basic
coding
multiple
descriptive
and
numeric
data
sources
were
employed
to
describe
the
process
and
outcomes
of
learning
coding
conclusions
include
1
teachers
should
start
learning
about
coding
first
with
short
awareness
sessions
and
then
move
to
their
own
classrooms
with

brokers
and
other
forms
of
assistance
2
a
focus
on
content
and
process
including
problem-solving
is
effective
for
coding
with
young

3
there
can
be
a
high
level
of
engagement
for
teachers
and
students
with
the
use
of

and
welldesigned
age-appropriate
coding
tasks
and

multiple

sources
and
the
inclusion
of
both
teacher
and

data
are
essential
in
exploring
coding
in

artificial
intelligence
ai
has
only
partially
or
not
at
all
been
integrated
into
medical
education
leading
to
growing
concerns
regarding
how
to
train
healthcare
practitioners
to
handle
the
changes
brought
about
by
the
introduction
of
ai
programming
lessons
and
other
technical
information
into
healthcare
curricula
has
been
proposed
as
a
solution
to
support
healthcare
personnel
in
using
ai
or
other
future
technology
however
integrating
these
core
elements
of
computer
science
knowledge
might
not
meet
the
observed
need
that
students
will
benefit
from
gaining
practical
experience
with
ai
in
the
direct
application
area
therefore
this
paper
proposes
a
dynamic
approach
to
case-based
learning
that
utilizes
the
scenarios
where
ai
is
currently
used
in
clinical
practice
as
examples
this
approach
will
support
students
understanding
of
technical
aspects
case-based
learning
with
ai
as
an
example
provides
additional
benefits
1
it
allows
doctors
to
compare
their
thought
processes
to
the
ai
suggestions
and
critically
reflect
on
the
assumptions
and
biases
of
ai
and
clinical
practice
2
it
incentivizes
doctors
to
discuss
and
address
ethical
issues
inherent
to
technology
and
those
already
existing
in
current
clinical
practice
3
it
serves
as
a
foundation
for
fostering
interdisciplinary
collaboration
via
discussion
of
different
views
between
technologists
multidisciplinary
experts
and
healthcare
professionals
the
proposed
knowledge
shift
from
ai
as
a
technical
focus
to
ai
as
an
example
for
case-based
learning
aims
to
encourage
a
different
perspective
on
educational
needs
technical
education
does
not
need
to
compete
with
other
essential
clinical
skills
as
it
could
serve
as
a
basis
for
supporting
them
which
leads
to
better
medical
education
and
practice
ultimately
benefiting
patients
international
policy
agendas
are
increasingly
focusing
on
the
21st
century
skills
needed
by
future

in
response
to

40
in
this
study
we
conduct
a
bibliometric
analysis
of
2662
articles
published
by
6579
authors
in
the
last
two
decades
to
understand
the
structure
of
the
scholarly
knowledge
in
this
field
we
first
identify
influential
articles
documents
journals
and
trends
in
this
literature
we
use
co-citation
analysis
to
identify
foundational
themes
in
the
development
of
21st
century
skills
literature
then
using
bibliometric
coupling
we
identify
communities
in
the
current
research
front
we
then
use
co-word
analysis
to
identify
future
directions
in
the
field
overall
we
find
that
research
on
21st
century
skills
has
grown
exponentially
in
the
past
two
decades
however
few
researchers
focus
primarily
on
this
topic
the
existing
research
is
primarily
dominated
by
psychologists
education
researchers
and
technology
researchers
we
also
find
that
specific
disciplines
such
as
industrial
engineering
and
nursing
are
prominent
contributors
in
the
field
and
that
critical_thinking
and
computational
thinking
are
key
areas
of
focus
molecular
biology
is
a
scientific
discipline
which
has
changed
fundamentally
in
character
over
the
past
decade
to
rely
on
large
scale
datasets
–
public
and
locally
generated
-
and
their
computational
analysis
and
annotation
undergraduate
education
of
biologists
must
increasingly
couple
this
domain
context
with
a
data-driven
computational
scientific
method
yet
modern
programming
and
scripting
languages
and
rich
computational
environments
such
as
r
and
matlab
present
significant
barriers
to
those
with
limited
exposure
to
computer
science
and
may
require
substantial
tutorial
assistance
over
an
extended
period
if
progress
is
to
be
made
in
this
paper
we
report
our
experience
of
undergraduate
bioinformatics
education
using
the
familiar
ubiquitous
spreadsheet
environment
of
microsoft
excel
we
describe
a
configurable
extension
called
qutbioexcel
a
custom
ribbon
supporting
a
rich
set
of
data
sources
external
tools
and
interactive
processing
within
the
spreadsheet
and
a
range
of
problems
to
demonstrate
its
utility
and
success
in
addressing
the
needs
of
students
over
their
studies
computational
thinking
and
coding
are
becoming
an
integral
part
of
k-12
education
with
female
students
being
underrepresented
in
such
subjects
the
proliferation
of
technological
tools
and
programming
environments
offers
the
opportunity
for
creative
coding
activities
for
children
and
increases
the
need
for
appropriate
instructional
practices
in
this
study
we
design
and
evaluate
a
coding
workshop
for
children
our
goal
is
to
examine
differences
between
boys
and
girls
using
eye-tracking
as
an
objective
measure
and
triangulating
the
findings
with
qualitative
data
coming
from
childrens
interviews
the
results
show
no
statistically
significant
difference
between
female
and
male
gaze
and
learning
gain
during
the
coding
activity
interestingly
the
qualitative
data
show
differences
in
the
strategies
and
implemented
practices
during
coding
and
in
perceptions
about
those
coding
activities
our
results
highlight
that
further
studies
need
to
utilize
objective
measures
and
unveil
necessary
differences
in
the
design
and
implementation
of
coding
activities
furthermore
our
results
provide
objective

of

this

evaluation
approach
one
theory
created

a
contribution

is
that

this

correlation
was
found
between
all
the
21st

a

the

critical_thinking
mediates
the
relationship
between
the
21st

skills
of
cooperativity
digital

however
somewhat
different
from

is
the
finding
that
communication
skills
directly
predict
problem_solving
without

thus
overall
the
findings
indicate
that

has
a
crucial

there
were

suggests
that
significant

is
useful
to
create

that
provide
educational

methods
starting
from

perspective
we
created
a

where
students
got
an
opportunity
to
self-assess
their
knowledge
in
computer

was
to
evaluate

in
this
commentary
we
make
a
case
for
the
explicit
inclusion
of
combinatorial
topics
in
mathematics
curricula
where
it
is
currently
essentially
absent
we
suggest
ways
in
which
researchers
might
inform
the
field’s
understanding
of
combinatorics
and
its
potential
role
in
curricula
we
reflect
on
five
decades
of
research
that
has
been
conducted
since
a
call
by
kapur
1970
for
a
greater
focus
on
combinatorics
in
mathematics
education
specifically
we
discuss
the
following
five
assertions
1
combinatorics
is
accessible
2
combinatorics
problems
provide
opportunities
for
rich
mathematical
thinking
3
combinatorics
fosters
desirable
mathematical
practices
4
combinatorics
can
contribute
positively
to
issues
of
equity
in
mathematics
education
and
5
combinatorics
is
a
natural
domain
in
which
to
examine
and
develop
computational
thinking
and
activity
ultimately
we
make
a
case
for
the
valuable
and
unique
ways
in
which
combinatorics
might
effectively
be
leveraged
within
k-16
curricula
despite
the
growing
number
of
digital
apps
designed
to
teach
coding
skills
to
young
children
we
know
little
about
their
effectiveness
to
formally
explore
this
question
we
conducted
a
naturalistic
observation
of
a
one-week
program
designed
to
teach
foundational
coding
skills
ie

results
suggest
that
young

can
learn
foundational
coding
skills
via

especially
when
the
apps
are
appealing
to

this
paper
investigates
how
children
who
are
engaged
in
a
creative
project
with
tangible
technology
kits
make
sense
of
the
system
feedback
the
technology
provides
a
micro-analytic
video
study
was
conducted
of
primary_school
children
designing
their
own
technologies
using
existing
educational
microcontrollers
our
investigation
reveals
that
the
roles
feedback
plays
in
children’s
interactions
cannot
easily
be
assimilated
within
the
existing
approaches
to
understand
feedback
that
have
been
articulated
in
hci
literature
our
qualitative
analysis
shows
how
children
do
not
make
sense
of
feedback
as
semantic
communication
from
the
system
but
make
sense
of
it
with
respect
to
its
embeddedness
in
a
sequence
of
activities
they
are
performing
with
the
system
and
each
other
the
principal
contribution
to
emerge
from
our
study
is
a
conception
of
feedback
as
a
process
rather
than
as
a
semantic
communicative
event
nor
a
direct
coupling
of
action
and
system
response
our
discussion
identifies
how
feedback
participates
in
the
institutional
agendas
of
classrooms
eg
discovery
computational

and
draws
out
initial
implications
for
the

here
we
report
a
study
investigating
elementary

female
studying
university-level
computing
were
asked
to
explain
their
understanding
of

concepts
without

in
individually
video-recorded
sessions
we
analysed
the
gestures
generated
for
three
elementary
concepts
algorithms
loops
and
conditional
statements
in
total
368
representational
gestures
were
identified
across
48
16
×
3
explanations
thereby
providing
evidence
that
offline
thinking
in
this
domain
is
embodied
our
analysis
of
representational
gestures
showed
that
participants
drew
upon
two
overarching
embodied
metaphors
in
their
explanations
1
computing
constructs
as
physical
objects
in
which
participants
simulated
manipulating
physical
objects
eg
pinching
when
referring
to
range
of
computing
constructs
and
2
computing
processes
as
motion
along
a
path
whereby
participants
moved
their
hands
along
one
of
three
body-based
axes
when
referring
to
temporal
sequences
we
contrast
our
findings
to
similar
research
in
mathematics
and
discuss
implications
for
computing
pedagogy
–
namely
the
role
of
gesture
in
the
classroom
and
technologies
that
can
exploit
embodied
metaphors

on
writing
software
discussion
of
computational
thinking
and
how
to
discuss
projects
with
mainstream
computer
scientists
and
it
was
followed
on
by
a
3-week
period
of
self-study
during
which
students
completed
a
project
we
explored
in
focus
groups
fgs
whether
students
thought
that
coding
has
a
place
in
the
undergraduate
medical
curriculum
results
our
results
demonstrate
that
medical
students
who
were
complete
novices
at
coding
could
be
taught
enough
to
be
able
to
create
simple
usable
clinical
programs
with
2
days
of
intensive
teaching
in
addition
6
major
themes
emerged
from
the
fgs
1
making
sense
of
coding
2
developing
the
students’
skill
set
3
the
value
of
coding
in
medicine
research
and
business
4
role
of
teaching
coding
in
medical
schools
5
the
concept
of
an
enjoyable
challenge
and
6
comments
on
the
course
design
conclusions
medical
students
can
acquire
usable
coding
skills
in
a
weekend
course
they
valued
the
teaching
and
identified
that
as
well
as
gaining
coding
skills
they
had
acquired
an
understanding
of
its
potential
both
for
their
own
projects
and
in
health
care
delivery
and
research
they
considered
that
coding
skills
teaching
should
be
offered
as
an
optional
part
of
the
medical
curriculum
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
push
to
introduce
coding
and
computational
thinking
in
early_childhood_education
and
robotics
is
an
excellent
tool
to
achieve
this
however
the
integration
of
these
fundamental
skills
into
formal
and
official
curriculums
is
still
a
challenge
and
educators
needs
pedagogical
perspectives
to
properly
integrate
robotics
coding
and
computational
thinking
concepts
into
their
classrooms
thus
this
study
evaluates
a
“coding
as
a
playground”
experience
in
keeping
with
the
positive
technological
development
ptd
framework
with
the
kibo
robotics
kit
specially
designed
for
young
children
the
research
was
conducted
with
preschool
children
aged
3–5
years
old
n
172
from
three
spanish
early
childhood
centers
with
different
socio-economic
characteristics
and
teachers
of
16
classes
results
confirm
that
it
is
possible
to
start
teaching
this
new
literacy
very
early
at
3
years
old
furthermore
the
results
show
that
the
strategies
used
promoted
communication
collaboration
and
creativity
in
the
classroom
settings
the
teachers
also
exhibited
autonomy
and
confidence
to
integrate
coding
and
computational
thinking
into
their
formal
curricular
activities
connecting
concepts
with
art
music
and
social
studies
through
the
evidence
found
in
this
study
this
research
contributes
with
examples
of
effective
strategies
to
introduce
robotics
coding
and
computational
thinking
into
early
childhood
classrooms
the
increased
use
of
ai
and
machine
learning
ml
calls
for
a
general
ai
literacy
in
particular
regarding
understanding
how
ml
works
the
process
behind
creating
ml
models
and
reflecting
on
its
implications
where
existing
learning
tools
focus
on
the
first
two
we
explore
opportunities
and
challenges
for
meaningfully
engaging
students
in
understanding
and
reflecting
on
ml
in
their
everyday
life
we
designed
votestratesml
following
a
constructive
design
research
approach
as
an
ethics-first
learning
tool
that
allow
students
to
explore
implications
of
ml
for
democratic
elections
based
on
deployments
of
votestratesml
in
two
high_school
social
studies
classrooms
we
found
that
safely
exploring
ml
from
a
concrete
starting
point
helped
students
reflect
and
form
opinions
about
its
use
that
promoting
iterative
exploration
through
collaboration
and
competition
motivated
them
to
explore
and
that
foregrounding
ethics
in
the
design
and
grounding
ml
in
a
well-known
subject
area
allowed
them
to
engage
with
ml
on
a
personal
level
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
growing
emphasis
placed
on
access
to
computational
thinking
ct
instruction
for
every
k-12
student
in
the
united
states
us
concurrently
calls
for
integrating
ct
concepts
within
authentic
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem
contexts
have
also
increased
this
is
reflected
by
the
inclusion
of
ct
in
the
next
generation
science
standards
and
the
standards
for
technological
and
engineering
literacy
however
methods
for
teaching
ct
concepts
within
secondary
level
stem
courses
vary
drastically
physical
computing
the
design
and
programming
of
physical

using
computational

skills
has
become
increasingly
popular
in
the
us
in
attempts
to
integrate
ct
within
authentic
stem
problem-solving
contexts
despite
this
rise
in
popularity
there
remains
a
limited
but
growing
body
of
research
investigating
physical
computing
pedagogy
and
student
learning
a
mixed_methods
design
was
used
in
this
study
to
examine
170
middle
school
students’
attitudes
toward
coding
and
after
participating
in
either
a
screen-based
or
physical
computing
unit
the
results
indicated
that
students
who
completed
the
screen-based
unit
reported
statistically
greater
attitudes
toward
the
classroom
applications
and
careerfuture
use
of
computing
concepts
students
in
the
treatment
group
believed
that
physical
computing
made
learning
computing
concepts
more
difficult
but
they
preferred
the
hands-on
learning
opportunities
provided
by
physical
computing
furthermore
male
students
reported
higher
attitudinal
ratings
than
females
regarding
the
influence
computing
would
have
on
their
future
academic
and
career
choices
this
study
provides
implications
for
improving
physical
computing
instruction
and
integration
within
stem
education
contexts
this
article
considers
the
implementation
of
a
new
learning
subject
”technology
comprehension”
into
lower
secondary
schools
in
denmark
as
part
of
an
initiative
by
the
danish
ministry
of
education
the
subject
consists
of
learning
objectives
related
to
computing
design
and
societal
reflection
and
was
first
introduced
as
an
elective
course
in
13
schools
to
investigate
how
it
could
be
integrated
into
the
danish
education
system
we
present
four
key
findings
based
on
school
visits
interviews
an
electronical
survey
two
questionnaires
and
workshops
including
theme
discussions
1
teachers
did
not
perceive
technology
comprehension
as
a
distinct
subject
but
rather
as
a
set
of
skills
that
can
be
integrated
into
other
subjects
2
teachers
pointed
out
that
technology
comprehension
opens
up
for
interdisciplinary
and
engaging
learning
activities
but
they
need
more
scaffolding
and
support
3
technology
comprehension
challenges
teachers’
existing
competencies
and
there
is
a
need
for
a
framework
that
takes
into
account
computing
design
and
societal
reflection
as
a
whole
4
technology
comprehension
appealed
to
various
kind
of
students
not
only
those
who
are
enthusiastic
about
technical
matters
this
study
contributes
to
the
previous
research
on
making
and
digital
fabrication
by
addressing
how
these
endeavours
are
implemented
on
a
national
level
through
engaging
with
local
teachers
we
call
for
more
research
on
scaffolding
and
supporting
teachers
to
orchestrate
meaningful
learning
activities
to
successfully
integrate
technology
comprehension
into
the
danish
national
education
the
ubiquity
of
smartphone
and
tablet
devices
combined
with
the
increasing
availability
of
serious
games
has
enabled
students
to
learn
various
abstract
concepts
in
an
appealing
and
convenient
manner
while
several
researchers
have
explored
the
use
of
augmented
reality
ar
in
serious
games
many
of
these
games
have
not
been
critically
explained
or
evaluated
to
that
end
we
employed
game-based_learning
methodologies
and
game
learning
analytics
gla
to
systematize
the
design
and
evaluation
of
an
ar-based
serious
game
to
teach
programming
we
evaluated
our
game
for
usability
and
effectiveness
by
conducting
a
user
study
on
twenty-seven
undergraduate
students
the
evaluation
primarily
consisted
of
a
learning
test
conducted
twice
–
before
and
after
playing
the
game
–
along
with
a
usability
questionnaire
that
players
completed
after
playing
the
game
our
results
showed
that
players
made
significant
progress
after
playing
the
game
the
game
helped
players
improve
their
basic
programming
skills
especially
for
the
group
having
lower
prior
programming
skills
the
results
highlighted
various
ways
in
which
gla
can
be
used
to
benefit
different
stakeholders
in
the
game
based
on
players’
qualitative
responses
we
also
identified
several
areas
of
improvement
most
prominently
the
trade-off
between
ease
of
use
and
game
complexity
we
provide
suggestions
and
discuss
implications
for
future
work
an
entire
generation
of
children
is
growing
up
with
machine
learning
ml
systems
that
are
greatly
disrupting
job
markets
as
well
as
changing
people’s
everyday
lives
yet
that
development
and
its
societal
effects
have
been
given
minor
attention
in
computing
education
in
schools
which
mainly
focuses
on
rule-based
programming

to
become
co-designers

supported
students
in
developing
various
kinds
of

the
results
of

further
indicated
that
co-designing

provided
a
promising
entry
point
for
students
to
develop
their
conceptual
understanding
of

the
spike
in
the
amount
of

has
increased
due
to
the
advances
in

etc
as
a
result
attackers
have
multiplied
their
efforts
for
the
purpose
of
rendering

systems
vulnerable
therefore
it
is
of
utmost
importance
to
improve
the
security
of
those
network
systems
in
this
study
an
ids
framework
using
machine
learning
ml
techniques
is
implemented
this
framework
uses
different
types
of
recurrent
neural
networks
rnns
namely
long-short

memory
lstm
gated
recurrent
unit
gru
and
simple
rnn
to
assess
the
performance
of
the
proposed

framework
the
nsl-kdd
and
the
unsw-nb15
benchmark
datasets
are
considered
moreover
existing
idss
suffer
from
low
test
accuracy
scores
in
detecting
new
attacks
as
the
feature
dimension
grows
in
this
study
an
xgboost-based
feature
selection
algorithm
was
implemented
to
reduce
the
feature
space
of
each
dataset
following
that
process
17
and
22
relevant
attributes
were
picked
from
the
unsw-nb15
and
nsl-kdd
respectively
the
accuracy
obtained
through
the
test
subsets
was
used
as
the
main
performance
metric
in
conjunction
with
the
f1-score
the
validation
accuracy
and
the
training
time
in
seconds
the
results
showed
that
for
the
binary

tasks
using
the
nsl-kdd
the
xgboost-lstm
achieved
the
best
performance
with
a

vac
of
9949
and
a
training

of
22546
s
for
the
unsw-nb15
the
xgboost-simple-rnn
was
the
most
efficient
model
with
a
tac
of
8707
for
the
multiclass
classification
scheme
the
xgboost-lstm
achieved
a
tac
of
8693
over
the
nsl-kdd
and
the
xgboost-gru
obtained
a
tac
of
7840
over
the
unsw-nb15

these
results
demonstrated
that
our
proposed

framework
performed
optimally
in
comparison
to
existing

topics
or

the
effectiveness
of

by
designing
a
game
as
a
pedagogical
strategy
are
some
areas
for
future
research
in
technology
education
there
has
been
a
paradigmatic
shift
towards
student-centered
approaches
such
as
learning
by
doing
constructionism
and
experiential
learning
educational
robotics
allows
students
to
experiment
with
building
and
interacting
with
their
creations
while
also
fostering
collaborative
work
however
understanding
the
students
response
to
these
approaches
is
crucial
to
adapting
them
during
the
teaching-learning
process
in
this
sense
neuroscientific
tools
such
as
functional
near-infrared
spectroscopy
and
eye-tracker
could
be
useful
allowing
the
investigation
of
relevant
states
experienced
by
students
although
they
have
already
been
used
in
educational
research
their
practical
relevance
in
the
teaching-learning
process
has
not
been
extensively
investigated
in
this
perspective
article
expressing
our
position
we
bring
four
examples
of
learning
experiences
in
a
robotics
class
with
children
in
which
we
illustrate
the
usefulness
of
these
tools
we
introduce
mindset
streams
for
assessing
ways
of
bridging
two
target
concepts
in
concept
maps
we
focus
on
behavioural
forma
mentis
networks
bfmn
which
map
the
associative
and
affective
dimensions
of
memory
recalls
inspired
by
trains
of
thoughts
taking
several
paths
to
link
ideas
mindset
streams
are
defined
as
bfmn
subgraphs
induced
by
all
shortest
paths
between
two
target
concepts
eg
all
recalls
in
shortest
paths
bridging
“math”
and
“learning”
these
streams
quantify
the
following
features
of
the
mindset
encoded
in
a
bfmn
i
semantic
content
ie
which
ideas
mediate
connections
between
targets
ii
valence
coherenceconflict
ie
are
connections
mediated
by
entwining
ideas
perceived
negatively
positively
or
neutrally
and
iii
semantic
relevance
ie
are
the
bridges
between
targets
peripheral
or
central
for
the
connectivitybetweenness
of
the
bfmn
we
investigate
mindset
streams
between
‘maths”“physics”
and
key
motivational
aspects
of
learning
“fun”
“work”
“failure”
in
two
bfmns
encoding
how
159
students
and
59
experts
perceived
and
associated
concepts
about
science
technology
engineering
and
maths
stem
respectively
statistical
comparisons
against
configuration
models
show
that
high
schoolers
bridge
“maths”
and
“fun”
only
through
overabundant
levels
of
valence-conflicting
associations
contrasting
negatively
perceived
domain
knowledge
with
peer-related
positive
experiences
this
conflict
is
absent
in
the
researchers’
mindset
stream
which
rather
bridges
“math”
and
“fun”
through
positive
science-related
associations
the
mindset
streams
of
both
groups
bridge
“maths”
and
“physics”
to
“work”
through
mostly
positive
career-related
jargon
students’
mindset
streams
of
“failure”
and
“math”“physics”
are
dominated
by
negative
associations
with
test
anxiety
whereas
researchers
integrate
“failure”
and
“math”“physics”
in
semantically
richer
and
more
positive
contexts
denoting
failure
itself
as
a
cornerstone
of
stem
learning
we
discuss
our
findings
and
future
research
directions
in

of

literature
many
stakeholders
have
suggested
that
if
girls
are
not
engaged
in
computer
science
at
an
early
age
the
field
of
computer
science
cs
and
computing-related
fields
will
continue
to
lack
gender
diversity
we
need
more
explorations
of
how
curriculum
impacts
girls’
interest
in
computer
science
at
the
elementary
level
the
focus
of
this
research
project
was
to
examine
how
an
elementary
problem-based_learning
pbl
curriculum
impacted
girls’
understanding
of
and
interest
in
cs
by
utilizing
a
curriculum
focused
on
a
problem
that
emphasized
social
activism
we
hypothesized
that
pbl
cs
could
increase
interest
in
cs
for
girls
this
study
used
a
mixed-method
sequential
explanatory
research
design
to
examine
the
implementation
of
a
cs
pbl
curriculum
with
four
6th
grade
teachers
and

anova
the

responses
were
analyzed
using

and
effect
sizes
for
each
comparison
were
calculated
using
partial
eta
squared
the
qualitative
data
was
analyzed
using
a
thematic
approach
that
required
four
researchers
to
come
to
a
consensus
results
suggested
that
although
girls
had
less
understanding
of
cs
at
the
beginning
by
the
end
of
the
curriculum
girls
and
boys
performed
similarly
however
there
were
still
elements
that
were
not
successful
girls’
attitudes
towards
computer
science
were
significantly
lower
than
the
boys
at
the
end
of
the
curriculum
conceptually
the
curriculum
needs
to
specifically
address
how
cs
could
impact
values
held
by
girls
with
the
development
of
computer
and
information
techniques

education
provides
potential
to
reshape
the

it
is
essential
to
understand
the
roles
of
robotics
in

as
well
as
their
relationships
with

specifically
this
systematic
review
proposed
a
conceptual
framework
based
on
two
dimensions
ie
learner
agency
robotic
interactivity
and
reviewed
92
empirical
studies
from
2010
to

to
clarify
four
categories
of
robotic
roles
namely
learning
about

furthermore
this

have
been
found
consistently
important
for

in
the
last
three
decades
although
this
observation
is
generally
made
from
the
teachers
perspective
neuroscience
can
provide
new
insights
by
establishing
the
neurobiological
underpinning
of
social

this
paper
further
develops
this
line
of
research
by
utilizing
graph
theory
to
represent
interactions
between
teachers
and
students
at
the
neural
level
through
hyperscanning
with
functional
near-infrared
spectroscopy
fnirs
we
collected
data
from
the
prefrontal

and
the
temporoparietal
junction
of
24

context
of
digital
transformation
educators
are
seeking
ways
to
guide
students
to
become
innovative
technology
designers
however
students
often
lack
innovative
problem-solving
skills
when
working
with
it
and
so
new
pedagogies
are
needed
to
improve
it-related
curricula
design
thinking
dt
as
a
methodology
may
offer
the
potential
to
meet
this
need
the
present
study
developed
a
dt-based
framework
for
the
design
of
it
learning
projects
a
quasi-experiment
was
conducted
in
a
junior
middle
school
employing
both
qualitative
and
quantitative

methods
to
explore
the
impact
of
dt
on
learning
outcomes
and
mechanisms
that
explain
the
observed
changes
in
student
performance
the
findings
demonstrate
that
dt
promotes
creativity
in
students’
digital
works
especially
their
value
diversity
and
originality
dt
also
enhances
students’
awareness
of
using

and
facilitates
their
basic

this
study
not
only
examines
the
impact
of
dt
on
it
education
but
also
explores
the
mechanisms
to
explain
the
observed

the
findings
can
serve
as
a
guide
for

to
further
optimize
the

and
nurture
innovative

the
study
identifies
and
classifies

by
looking
at
globally

43
universities
we
analyze
descriptions
of
the
declared

located
on
universities’
official
websites
we
take
into
account
both
available

and
general
descriptions
on
the

the
method
is
manual
content-analysis
we
find
a
lack
of

and
high

including
formulations
related
to

we
develop
the
classification
of
declared

institutions
based
on
the
ideas
of

log-based
process
data
has
been
increasingly
used
in
computer-based

provides
a
systematic
review
of
the
use
of
log-based

we
identified
2548

of
which
330

finally
included
in
this

after
careful
screening
and

the
results
of
this

can
assist

in
better
understanding
1
what
are
the
trends
in

2
which

3
what

and
4
what
are
the

challenges
and
future
recommendations
for

by
examining
these
questions
we
conclude
that
the
use
of
log-based
process
data
in
computer-based
assessment
shows
many
potentials
for
enhancing
the
assessment
therefore
more
study
using
log-based
process
data
in
various
fields
is
encouraged
to
better
understand
test-takers’
underlying
response
processes
during
assessments
additionally
there
is
also
a
considerable
demand
for
validating
process
indicators
and
the
generalizability
of
findings
in
the
present
work
efforts
have
been
made
to
create
a
configuration-based
approach
to
knowledge
extraction
the
notion
of
granularity
is
developed
which
allows
fine-tuning
the
expressive
possibilities
of
the
semantic
network
as
known
the
central
issues
for
knowledge-based
systems
are
what’s-in-a-node
and
what’s-in-a-link
as
shown
the
answer
can
be
obtained
from
the
functor-as-object
representation
then
the
nodes
are
functors
and
the
main
links
are
natural
transformations
such
a
model
is
applicable
to
represent
morphing
and
the
object
is
considered
as
a
process
which
is
in
a
harmony
with
current
ideas
on
computing
it
is
possible
to
represent
information
channels
that
carry
out
the
transformations
of
processes
the
possibility
of
generating
displaced
concepts
and
the
generation
of
families
of
their
morphs
is
shown
the
evolvent
of
stages
of
knowledge
and
properties
of
the
process
serve
as
parameters
we
uncover
the
solution
space
of
a
five
dimensional
geometry
which
we
deem
it
as
the
direct
counterpart
of
the
bianchi
type
v
cosmological
model
we
kinematically
reduce
the
scale
factor
matrix
and
then
with
an
appropriate
scaling
and
choice
of
time
we
cast
the
spatial
equations
into
a
simple
“kasner”
like
form
thus
revealing
linear
integrals
of
motion
their
number
is
enough
so
that
along
with
the
quadratic
constraint
it
suffices
to
scan
the
entire
space
of
solutions
the
latter
is
revealed
to
be
quite
rich
containing
cosmological

some
of
which
admit

systematically
examines
the
influence
of

problem
of
inadequate

it
highlights
how
technological
innovations
particularly
in

applications
are
designed
to
enhance
children’s
skills
while
safeguarding
their

a
critical
aspect
of
this

is
the
assessment
of

a
growing
concern
in

the
findings
reveal
that

offering
an
outlook
of
how

is
contributing
and
will
continue
to
contribute
to

innovations
in

the
overarching
aim
of
this
study
was
to
explore
young
childrens
n

mage
516
years
play
with
two
coding
games
daisy
the
dinosaur
and
kodable
in
a

child

tablet
setting
we
had
three
research
questions
focused
on
childrens
game
play
1
how
does
the
structure
of
each
game
influence
childrens
play
2
do
children
play
more
or
less
independently
depending
on
the
game
they
play
3
do
children
who
play
the
games
more
independently
learn
more
coding
skills
three
researchers
coded
more
than
6
h
of
video
data
showing
childrens
play
with
digital
coding
games
findings
include
that
the
type
of
game
did
influence
the
different
ways
that
children
behaved
while
playing
however
during
both
games
children
had
the
same
amount
of
independent
play
children
who
played
more
independently
during
daisy
the
dinosaur
learned
more
coding
skills
this
may
be
because
these
children
were
focusing
more
on
the
game
than
their
peers
as
we
did
not
find
a
similar
effect
for
the
game
kodable
we
discuss
the
ways
that
children
play
structured
vs
open
structured
ie
sandbox
digital
games
with
a
particular
focus
on
how
game
play
may
influence
learning
as
opportunities
for
individual
device
ownership
in

increase
future
work
should
continue
to
explore
how
game

algorithmic_thinking
is
emerging
as
an
important
competence
in
mathematics
education
yet
research
appears
to
be
lagging
this
shift
in
curricular
focus
the
aim
of
this
generative
study
is
to
examine
how
students
use
the
cognitive
skills
of
algorithmic_thinking
to
design
algorithms
task-based
interviews
were
conducted
with
four
pairs
of

students
n

to
analyze
how
they
used
decomposition
and
abstraction
to
specify
the
projects
designed
algorithms
to
solve
scheduling
problems
by
first
devising
fundamental
operations
and
then
using
algorithmic
concepts
to
account
for
complex
and
special
cases
of
the
problems
and
tested
and
debugged
their
algorithms
a
deductive-inductive
analytical
process
was
used
to
classify
students’
responses
according
to
the
four
cognitive
skills
to
develop
sets
of
subskills
to
describe
how
the
students
engaged
these
cognitive

education
was
previously
taught
primarily
at

but
has
recently
started
to
be
expanded
to

settings
when
available
at
the

is
often
taught
within
computer
science
courses
which
may
potentially
reinforce

and
discourage

students
engagement
in
ai
literacy
education
the
predominant
teaching
methods
are
constructivist
approaches
which
while
effective
in
fostering
active
learning
heavily
emphasize
technical
skills
and
are
therefore
limited
in
their
pedagogical
scope
as
they
underplay
other
important
questions
such
as
disinformation
data
justice
and
ais
ethical
and
societal
implications
the
lack
of
a
clear
definition
of
ai
literacy
for
primary_education
also
raises
questions
about
what
to
teach
and
how
to
teach
it
additionally
little
attention
has
been
devoted
to
understanding
gender
differences
in

outcomes
within
ai

primary_education
this
study
advocates
the
use
of
an
arts-based
transdisciplinary
approach
for
teaching
ai
literacy
to
25
primary_school
students
a
pilot
study
utilizing
mixed_methods
was
conducted
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
this
arts-based
approach
quantitative
analysis
through
a
paired
t-test
revealed
a
statistically
significant
improvement
in
ai
literacy
among
students
participating
in
knowledge
tests
moreover
the
results
of
the
mann‒whitney
and
kruskal‒wallis
tests
indicated
that
gender
and
age
did
not
impact
pre-
and
post-knowledge
test
scores
qualitative
analyses
further
revealed
the
pedagogical
benefits
of
the
arts-based
approach
demonstrating
that
students
enhance
their
conceptual
understanding
of
ai
literacy
by
reflecting
on
their
artifacts
this
study
contributes
to
the
literature
by
providing
evidence
with
a
small
sample
size
that
the
arts-based
approach
can
overcome
age
and
gender
barriers
to
accessing
ai
literacy
education
and
can
serve
as
a
means
to
teach
ai
thinking
this

of
the
international
conference
on
computational

iccs
which
contains
5982
domain-specific

over
seventeen
years
2001–2017
we
discuss
the

and
show
how

have
evolved
over

to
the

and
how
all
these

illustrates
the

by
constructing
static

provide
insights
regarding
the

and
show
how
“computational

has
propagated
across

we
used
the

to
discover

the
resulting

were
then
manually
labelled
and
grouped

next
we
applied

change
point
analysis
cpa
to
study
the
evolution
of

over
seventeen
years
and
to
identify
the
growing
and
disappearing
topics
we
used
gephi
to
examine
the
static
networks
of
topics
and
an
r
library
called
dya
to
analyse
the
dynamic
networks
of

we
also
analysed
the
conference
as
a
platform
for
potential
collaboration
development
through
the
perspective
of

networks
the
results
show
that
authors
of
iccs
papers
continue
to
actively
collaborate
after
the
conference
−
on
average
authors
collaborate
with
three
other

−
which
suggests
that

loaded
with
biases
most

are

by
the

and
misled
by
the
hardware
and

providers
who
try
to
convince
and
force
education
systems
to
keep
track
of
untraceable
developments
however
recent
studies
have
revealed
that
the
productivity
of
the
participants
and
the
sustainability
of
their
digital
artifacts
generate
a
huge
but
silent
waste
both
in
terms
of
human
and
machine
resources
this
contradiction
generates
a
paradox
in
which
the
illusion
of
digital
prosperity
does
not
allow
us
to
clearly
see
the
ineffectiveness
of
digital
processes
and
artifacts
and
the
losses
piling

our
research
revealed
that
the
methodology
of
lean

allows
us
to
find
the
root
causes
of
the
problems
and
the
revolutionary
changes
which
must
be
applied
to
eliminate
the
waste
generated
by
the

in
the
digital

it
was
also
found
that
the
adaptation
of
the
lean
philosophy
proven
effective
in
production

and
administration
can
be
a
solution
in
resolving
the
paradox
of
digital

which
leads
us
to
lean
digital

lde
within
this
framework
–
instead
of
the
widely
accepted
tool-centered
ideas
–
we
offer
a
human-centered
long-term

philosophy
focusing
on
respect
for

while
at
the

time
eliminating

the

under

becomes
a
matter
of
scientific

during

the
transformative

became
obvious
and
advanced
the

however
when
the

was
shared
and
announced
by
scientists
in
southern
africa
various
challenges
arose
including
travel

the
scientific
economic

moral
impact
was
catastrophic
yet
travel

failed
to
mitigate
the
spread
of
the

already
present
in

public

abstract
in
this
document
we
describe
the
development
of
a
remote
lab
and
two
user
interfaces
for
teaching
programming
and
fundamentals
of
robotics
using
arduino
boards
one
of
the
interfaces
uses
visual
language
to
make
the
experience
more
attractive
for
those
who
are
beginning
their
studies
the
second
interface
provides
an
environment
similar
to
the
original
arduino’s
one
for
those
users
who
have
some
background
to
use
textual
programming
language
in
addition
we
present
an
usability
evaluation
of
the
application
using
visual
programming
language
to
obtain
a
broad
feedback
mainly
in
terms
of
target
audience’s
acceptance
and
suggestions
for
improvements
the
environment
is
still
an
ongoing
work
but
it
is
suitable
for
courses
and
workshops
especially
for
institutions
with
limited
resources
the
interest
in
artificial
intelligence
ai
in
education
has
erupted
during
the
last
few
years
primarily
due
to
technological
advances
in
ai
it
is
therefore
argued
that
students
should
learn
about
ai
although
it
is
debated
exactly
how
it
should
be
applied
in
education
ai
literacy
has
been
suggested
as
a
way
of
defining
competencies
for
students
to
acquire
to
meet
a
future
everyday-
and
working
life
with
ai
this
study
argues
that
researchers
and
educators
need
a
framework
for
integrating
ai
literacy
into
technological
literacy
where
the
latter
is
viewed
as
a
multiliteracy
this
study
thus
aims
to
critically
analyse
and
discuss
different
components
of
ai
literacy
found
in
the
literature
in
relation
to
technological
literacy
the
data
consists
of
five
ai
literacy
frameworks
related
to
three
traditions
of
technological
knowledge
technical
skills
technological
scientific
knowledge
and
socio-ethical
technical
understanding
the
results
show
that
ai
literacy
for
technology
education
emphasises
technological
scientific
knowledge
eg
knowledge
about
what
ai
is
how
to
recognise
ai
and
systems
thinking
and
socio-ethical
technical
understanding
eg
ai
ethics
and
the
role
of
humans
in
ai
technical
skills
such
as
programming
competencies
also
appear
but
are
less
emphasised
implications
for
technology
education
are
also
discussed
and
a
framework
for
ai
literacy
for
technology
education
is
suggested
this
study
delves
into
the
efficacy
of
the
petz
recovery
map
within
the
context
of
two
paradigmatic
quantum
channels
dephasing
and
amplitude-damping
while
prior
investigations
have
predominantly
focused
on
qubits
our
research
extends
this
inquiry
to
higher-dimensional
systems
we
introduce
a
novel
state-independent
framework
based
on
the
choi-jamiołkowski
isomorphism
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
the
petz
map
by
analyzing
different
channels
and
the
non-unital
nature
of
these
processes
we
emphasize
the
pivotal
role
of
the
reference
state
selection
in
determining
the
maps
effectiveness
furthermore
our
analysis
underscores
the
considerable
impact
of
suboptimal
choices
on

a
broader
consideration
of
factors
such
as

although
based

suggest
that

quantum
biology
is
most
simply
the
investigation
of
quantum
effects
in
biological
systems
while
all
matter
is
fundamentally
quantum
quantum
biology
focuses
on
those
quantum
effects
that
result
in
properties
of
biological
scale
and
relevance
it
has
long
been
argued
that
quantum
effects
are
incompatible
with
biological
systems
due
to
the
likelihood
of
decoherence
but
nature
is
a
surprising
and
enterprising
engineer
in
this
sense
quantum
biology
is
the
study
of
natures
materials
and
how
they
might
sustain
and
enhance
quantum
effects
even
in
hot
and
wet
environments
quantum
mechanics
was
developed
in
response
to
seemingly
anomalous
interactions
between
light
and
matter
it
seems
fitting
that
a
great
deal
of
the
progress
made
in
quantum
biology
in
the
last
few
decades
has
been
on
the
topic
of
photosynthesis
the
interaction
of
light
with
living
matter
the
interaction
of
electromagnetic
radiation
with
matter
is
also
at
the
heart
of
many
other
topics
of
quantum
biology
this
review
is
a
broad
overview
of
the
current
state
of
this
research
while
the
underlying
quantum
effects
are
often
similar—energy
and
charge
transfer
tunnelling
spin
dynamics—the
biological
contexts
are
varied
and
continue
to
grow
these
contexts
include
enzyme
catalysis
dna
mutation
receptor
binding
photosynthesis
microtubule
and
mitochondrial
function
magnetoreception
regulation
of
the
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
calcium
ion
storage
and
release
and
potentially
consciousness
while
there
remain
a
number
of
reservations
regarding
quantum
biology
progress
made
in
this
regard
might
further
our
understanding
of
both
quantum
and
biological
systems
with
respect
to
the
latter
advances
in
understanding
biology
might
also
contribute
to
a
better
understanding
of
physiology
and
the
development
of
new
therapeutics
but
quantum
biology
might
equally
advance
our
understanding
of
quantum
mechanics
by
illustrating
what
quantum
effects
could
look
like
in
the
novel

comments
are
vital
for
software
documentation
they
provide
necessary
insights
and
assist
developers
in
understanding
and
maintaining
the
software
due
to
their
importance
comments
have
been
extensively
studied
and
much
has
been
learned
about
them
these
existing
studies
have
predominantly
focused
on
text-based
languages
conversely
block-based
visual
programming
languages
particularly
scratch
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
some
studies
regarding
comments
related
to
the
scratch
online
community
focus
on
topics
such
as
fostering

sentiment
analysis
etc
however
they
overlook
the
visual

and
the
qualitative

this
is
a
meaningful
limitation
and
this

we
examined

was
manually
annotated
based
on

are
regarded
as
key

for
todays

interest
in
robotics
usage
to
develop
such
competencies
in
educational
settings
arises
but
there
hasnt
been
so
far
mapping
of
the
research
conducted
in
this
field
thus
we
present
a
scoping
review
of
59
articles
published
from
2012
to
2023
in
4
databases
and
2
registers
examining
kindergarteners
skills
through
educational
robotics
our
goal
was
to
map
which
skills
are
commonly
examined
in
kindergarten
and
under
which
terminology
as
well
as
to
investigate
the
studies
features
the
types
of
robotics
and
the
assessment
tools
utilized
our
findings
depict
that
several
skills
are
evaluated
using
different
terms
critical_thinking
is
examined
most
frequently
creativity
the
least
and
communication
is
integrated
into
collaboration
and
the
opposite
most
of
the
researchers
used
the
mixed
method
focusing
on
qualitative
tools
examining
quite
a
small
sample
size
and
conducting
the
intervention
for
a
short
time
also
bee_bot
lego
robotics
kits
wedo
mindstorms
and
social
humanoid
robots
are
often
used
additionally
the
evaluation
tools
used
in
the
reviewed
papers
are
presented
and
categorized
into
groups
this
scoping
demonstrates
that
robotics
might
affect
positively
the
childrens
cognitive
skills
and
creativity
but
may
not
facilitate
their
interactions
so
much
regarding
emotional
expressions
moreover
a
gap
in
quantitative
research
on
kindergarteners
skills
development
via
educational
robotics
is
spotted
finally
this
scoping
review
suggests
creating
clear
terms
for
skills
developing
robotics
tailored
to
kindergarten
age
forming
full
robotics
activities
and
designing
modular
evaluation
tools
for
young
learners
capacities
storytelling
has
been
used
for
years
in
educational
practice
and
educational
robotics
is
a
rapidly
growing
field
worldwide
accordingly
researchers
have
attempted
to
combine
storytelling
and
robotics
in
education
however
no
systematic
record
exists
on
this
combination
therefore
we
conducted
a
scoping
review
of
82
papers
out
of
5272
articles
published
in
5
databases
in
the
last
20
years
to
map
the
conducted
research
so
far
in
detail
the
educational
levels
and
the
school
subjects
in
which
storytelling
and
educational
robotics
are
applied
the
types
of
robots
used
the
duration
the

participants
age
and
the
skills
that
students
may
develop
through
this
combination
additionally
we
analyzed
grouped
and
presented
the
tools
used
for
measuring
the
potential
effects
of
storytelling
and
educational
robotics
finally
the
students
role
in
the
activities
was
sought
based
on
our
findings
most
interventions
mainly
addressed
preschool
and
primary_school
students
the
robots
used
the
most
are
humanoid
most
interventions
did
not
exceed
6
h
and
the
number
of
participants
was
less
than
20
students
besides
most
interventions
tried
to
develop
students’
skills
communication
creativity
collaboration
and
attitudes
engagement
motivation
participation
with
qualitative
tools
borrowed
from
other
domains
eg
psychology
healthcare
this
scoping
demonstrates
a
gap
in
the
use
of
storytelling
and
educational
robotics
in
secondary
and
university
education
and
subjects
like
history
geography
etc
finally
this
combination
seems
to
have
the
potential
to
enhance
the
educational
process
but
more
research
is
needed
to
shed
light
on
all
the
aspects
of
the
combination
in
this
digital
age
where
machine
learning
has
won
the
nobel
prizes
in
both
physics
and

it
is
ever
more
important
to
give

an
educational
advantage
that
will
enable
them
to
use
the

cs
is
facing
a
crucial
challenge
in
broadening

and
in
cultivating

success
in
bridging
the

gap
by
leveraging

thus
charting
alternative

establishing
a

ai
applications
the
interest
in
their
use
in
every
segment
and
field
of
society
in
recent
years
has
been
increasing
rapidly
one
of
these
areas
is
programming
learning
and
program
writing
processes
one
of
the
generative
ai
tools
used
for
this
purpose
is
chatgpt
the
use
of
chatgpt
in
program
writing
processes
has
become
widespread
and
this
tool
has
a
certain
potential
in
the
programming
process
however
when
the
literature
is
examined
research
results
related
to
using
chatgpt
for
this
purpose
have
yet
to
be
found
the
existing
literature
has
a
gap
that
requires
exploration
this
study
aims
to
analyze
the
students
perspectives
on
using
chatgpt
in
the
field
of
programming
and
programming
learning
the
study
encompassed
a
cohort
of
41
undergraduate
students
enrolled
in
a
public
universitys
computer
technology
and
information
systems
department
the
research
was
carried
out
within
the
scope
of
the
object-oriented
programming
ii
course
for
eight
weeks
throughout
the
research
process
students
were
given
project
assignments
related
to
the
course
every
week
and
they
were
asked
to
use
chatgpt
while
solving
them
the
research
data
was
collected
using
a
form
consisting
of
open-ended
questions
and
analyzed
through
content
analysis
the
research
findings
revealed
both
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
chatgpt
usage
as
perceived
by
the
students
the
students
stated
that
the
main
benefits
of
using
chatgpt
in
programming
learning
are
providing
fast
and
mostly
correct
answers
to
questions
improving
thinking
skills
facilitating
debugging
and
increasing
self-confidence
on
the
other
hand
the
main
limitations
of
using
chatgpt
in
programming
education
were
getting
students
used
to
laziness
being
unable
to
answer
some
questions
or
giving
incompleteincorrect
answers
causing
professional
anxiety
in
students
based
on
the
results
of
the
research
it
can
be
said
that
it
would
be
useful
to
integrate
generative
ai
tools
into
programming
courses
considering
the
advantages
they
provide
in
programming
teaching
however
appropriate
measures
should
be
taken
regarding
the
limitations
it
brings
based
on
the
research
findings
several
recommendations
were
proposed
regarding
the
integration
of
chatgpt
into
lessons
the
advent
of
the
digital
era
has
significantly
heightened
interest
in
digital
literacy
across
multidisciplinary
backgrounds
and
has
endowed
these
fields
with
interdisciplinary
and
integrative
characteristics
in
this
study
we
employed
vosviewer

collaborative
programming
is
being
increasingly
used
to
overcome
the
difficulties
of
the

programming
process
in
this
study
we
investigated
the
effect
of
collaborative
perception
on
cognitive
engagement
and
learning
outcomes
in
collaborative
programming
we
used
a
quasi-experimental
research
to
determine
the
differences
in
cognitive
engagement
and
learning
outcomes
of
three
groups
with
different
levels
of
collaborative
perception
the
findings
highlight
several
important
conclusions
first
there
were
significant
differences
in
cognitive
engagement
and
learning
outcomes
across
collaborative
perception
groups
students
with
high
levels
of
collaborative
perception
demonstrate
more
comprehensive
and
diverse
cognitive
engagement
resulting
in
higher
learning
outcomes
compared
to
those
with
lower
perception
second
students
in
the
low
collaborative
perception
group
had
more
clarification-elaboration
cognitive
connections
and
students
in
the
high
collaborative
perception
group
had
stronger
clarification-positioning
and
clarification-verification
cognitive
connections
third
collaborative
perception
positively
moderated
the
relationship
between
cognitive
engagement
and
learning
outcomes
in
particular
three
cognitive
engagement
clarification
elaboration
and
positioning
had
a
greater
impact
on
performance
when
moderated
by
collaborative
perceptions
these
findings
have
practical
implications
for
educators
and
course
designers
emphasizing
the
importance
of
considering
students
collaborative
perception
when
forming
groups
and
promoting
effective
collaborative
programming
educational
robotics
has
had
an
important
impact
in
recent
years
as
it
offers
a
number
of
advantages
for
students
the
inclusion
of
robotics
in
any
educational
stage
requires
teachers
with
adequate
predisposition
and
training
making
it
necessary
to
know
the
opinions
of
pre-service
teachers
the
aim
of
our
study
is
to
analyze
the
perceptions
and
self-confidence
of
109
pre-service
primary_education
teachers
before
and
after
an
intervention
based
on
educational
robotics
and
challenge-based
learning
to
teach
scientific
and
mathematical
content
in
their
third
academic
year
a
quasi-experimental
design
was
used
involving
pretest
and
posttest
using
the
nonparametric
mann-whitney
and
wilcoxon
u
tests
the
results
showed
a
significant
improvement
in
the
overall
mean
self-confidence
in
addition
the
intervention
led
to
a
more
positive
perception
of
the
benefits
and
possibilities
of
robotics
for
teaching
of
scientific
and
mathematical
content
although
it
also
increased
the
difficulties
of
implementation
due
to
the
lack
of
training
in
this
digital
resource
it
is
concluded
that
interventions
are
required
based
on
educational
robotics
that
allow
pre-service
teachers
to
gain
the
necessary
self-confidence
and
perception
to
facilitate
its
introduction
for
the
teaching
of
scientific
and
mathematical
content
with
the
rapid
development
of
the
era
of
artificial

is
also
highlighted
as
one
of
the
necessary
abilities
of

in
which
they
reflected
on

we
draw
on

to
present
evidence
that
computing
is
an
inherent
part
of
doing

and
is
a
practice
they
want

develop
we
also
discuss
the

the
intersection
of
mathematical
cognition
metacognition
and
advanced
technologies
presents
a
frontier
with
profound
implications
for
human
learning
and
artificial
intelligence
this
paper
traces
the
historical
roots
of
these
concepts
from
the
pythagoreans
and
aristotle
to
modern
cognitive
science
and
explores
their
relevance
to
contemporary
technological
applications
we
examine
how
the
pythagoreans
view
of
mathematics
as
fundamental
to
understanding
the
universe
and
aristotles
contributions
to
logic
and
categorization
have
shaped
our
current
understanding
of
mathematical
cognition
and
metacognition
the
paper
investigates
the
role
of
boolean
logic
in
computational
processes
and
its
relationship
to
human
logical
reasoning
as
well
as
the
significance
of
bayesian
inference
and
fuzzy
logic
in
modelling
uncertainty
in
human
cognition
and
decision-making
we
also
explore
the
emerging
field
of
chemical
artificial
intelligence
and
its
potential
applications
we
argue
for
unifying
mathematical
metacognition
with
advanced
technologies
including
artificial
intelligence
and
robotics
while
identifying
the
multifaceted
benefits
and
challenges
of
such
unification
the
present
paper
examines
essential
research
directions
for
integrating
cognitive
sciences
and
advanced
technologies
discussing
applications
in
education
healthcare
and
business
management
we
provide
suggestions
for
developing
cognitive
robots
using
specific
cognitive
tasks
and
explore
the
ethical
implications
of
these
advancements
our
analysis
underscores
the
need
for
interdisciplinary
collaboration
to
realize
the
full
potential
of
this
integration
while
mitigating
potential
risks
computational
activity
is
now
recognized
as
a
natural
science
and
computational
and
information
processes
have
been
discovered
in
the
deep
structures
of
many
areas
computations
in
the
natural
world
were
present
long
before
the
invention
of
computers
but
a
remarkable
shift
in
understanding
its
fundamental
nature
occurs
in
fact
before
our
eyes
the
present
moment
in
fact
is
a
transition
from
the
concept
of
computer
science
as
an
artificial
science
to
the
understanding
that
information
processes
are
abundant
in
nature
computing
is
recognized
as
a
natural
science
that
studies
natural
and
artificial
information
processes
in
everyday
computing
operations
are
performed
on
the
individual
generators
with
little
attention
paid
to
their
internal
structure
however
many
common
operations
consist
of
more
primitive
constructions
connected
by
a
combination
mode
the
interaction
of
information
processes
and
corresponding
structures
is
carried
out
in
an
environment
of
“applicative
interaction”
their
applications
to
each
other
and
the
study
of
the
properties
of
this
environment
allows
us
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
computations
in
the
present
work
the
main
attention
is
paid
to
elucidating
the
technological
features
of
computations
with
individual
generators
or
objects
their
interaction
is
considered
in
an
applicative
environment
which
allows
us
to
elucidate
the
internal
structure
of
ordinary
operations
the
knowledge
of
which
allows
us
to
understand
their
properties
the
choice
of
initial
constant
generators
considered
as
generic
ones
and
expressed
by
combinators
is
discussed
these
initial
generators
are
used
as
the
main
“building
blocks”
that
occur
within
the
larger
blocks
of
the
applicative
environment
in
interaction
with
each
other
as
a
result
of
the
interaction
constructions
arise
that
give

is
concerned
with
the
problem
of
understanding

constructing
computational
artifacts
that
manifest
behavior
which
would
be
deemed
‘creative’
if
exhibited
by
human

historically
this
problem
is
a
derivative
of
the
agenda
of
artificial

ai
and
thus
is
a
technological
problem
however
as
will
be
seen
even
in
the
specifically
technological
realm
of
computational

issues
pertaining
to
human
creativity
cannot
be
evaded
since
at
the
very
least
the
criteria
for
judging
and
evaluating
the
creativity
of
computational
artifacts
will
originate
in
the
realm
of
human
creativity
mathematics
offers
a
virtually
infinite
range
of
incomparably
beautiful
shapes
and
patterns
that
can
be
used
in
the
production
of

objects
in
particular
the
generation
of
a
large
number
of
patterns
can
be
achieved
by
varying
input
parameters
of
reaction-diffusion
models
which
simulate
the
distribution
of
chemicals
these
patterns
can
be
used
in
the
customization
of
objects
whose
prototypes
are
made
through
additive
manufacturing
3d

this
technique
allows
very
complex
shapes
and
unique

to
be
physicalized
in
a

highlighted
the
possibility
of

students
starting
their
tertiary
studies
in
informatics
are
found
to
have
a

which
leads
to
the
high
number
of
drop

the
students’
low

skills
contrasts
with
their

and
a

suggestions
to

the
challenges
are
provided
the
paper
introduces
a
visual
programming
language
and
corresponding
web
and
cloud-based
development
environment
called
netsblox
netsblox
is
an
extension
of
snap
and
builds
upon
its
visual
formalism
as
well
as
its
open
source
code
base
netsblox
adds
distributed
programming
capabilities
by
introducing
two
well-known
abstractions
to
block-based
programming
message
passing
and
remote
procedure
calls
rpc
messages
containing
data
can
be
exchanged
by
two
or
more
netsblox
programs
running
on
different
computers
connected
to
the
internet
rpcs
are
called
on
a
client
program
and
are
executed
on
the
netsblox
server
these
two
abstractions
make
it
possible
to
create
distributed
programs
such
as
multi-player
games
or
client–server
applications
we
believe
that
netsblox
not
only
teaches
basic
distributed
programming
concepts
but
also
provides
increased
motivation
for
high-school
students
to
become
creators
and
not
just
consumers
of
technology
teaching
programming
logic
to
students
who
do
not
have
a
background
in
computer
science
is
challenging
as
the
instructor
has
to
awaken
problem-solving
critical_thinking
and
logical
reasoning
skills
several
programming
tools
have
been
created
to
teach
coding
concepts
to
computer
science
students
of
different
ages
however
these
tools
are
not
well
designed
to
meet
the
challenge
of
teaching
programming
to
new
developers
who
come
with
school
training
in
other
areas
such
as
accounting
management
etc
therefore
this
research
focused
on
analyzing
the
importance
of
the
application
of
online
programming
tools
to
students
starting
college
who
come
with
a
school
background
in
an
area
other
than
technology
a
prepost
experimental
design
was
carried
out
with
82
first-level
students
of
the
technical
university
of
ambato
in
the
careers
of
systems
and
electronics
the
results
revealed
that
45
of
the
students
increased
their
levels
of
application
and
analysis
in
programming
processes
in
addition
the
research
revealed
that
students
who
come
from
a
background
other
than
computer
science
agree
with
the
integration
of
online
programming
tools
from
the
first
level
of
university
entrance
since
this
method
helps
to
improve
their
learning
capacity
critical_thinking
is
often
regarded
as
one
of
the
vital
skills
in
the
21st
century
in
recent
years
it
has
become
important
to
combine
this
skill
with
other
skills
such
as

we
computed
the
groups’
objective
performance
which
was
calculated
based
on
their
created
artifacts
we
divided
them
into
high
and
low
performance
and
compared
them
based
on
individual
emotions’
duration
and
the
transitions
among
the
emotions
we
also
used
the
subjective
indication
of
their
perceived
performance
from
a
self-reported
questionnaire
divided
them
into
another
performance
category
and
did
a
similar
analysis
with
the
objective

results
show
that
the
objective

is
better
explained
by

toolkits
have
long
been
used
in

to
learn
about

this
paper
presents
a
comprehensive
toolkit
that
can
help
educators
teach

with
an
emphasis
on
collaboration
and
provides
suggestions
for
its
effective
pedagogical
implementation
the
toolkit
comprises
the
talkoo
kit
with
physical

plug-and-play
modules
and
a

environment
the
key
suggestions
are
inspired
by
the
results
of
the
evaluation
studies
which
show
that
children
aged
14–18
in
a
sample
group
of
34
students
are
well
motivated
when
working
with
the
toolkit
but
lack
confidence
in
the
kit’s
support
for
collaborative_learning
if
the
intention
is
to
move
beyond
tools
and
code
in
computer
education
to
community
and
context
thus
encouraging
computational
participation
collaboration
should
be
considered
as
a
key
aspect
of

our
approach
expands
the

with
a
focus
on
empowering

in
this

we
propose
an
end-user

approach
to
this
problem
introducing
tapas
a
system
that
combines
a
tangible

stem
from
a

we
carried
out
with

we
then
carried
out
a
preliminary
evaluation
of
our

gathering
useful
feedback
to
improve

digital
game
making
is
becoming
an
increasingly
common
means
of
learning
in
schools
due
to
the
appeal
of
delivering
curriculum-based
learning
objectives
while
tapping
into
the
popularity
of
videogames
indeed
research
suggests
that
digital
game
making
may
improve
cognitive
and
behavioral
skills
in
learners
and
this
may
have
significant
impact
on
learners
with
special
education
needs
and
disabilities
send
however
past
work
in
digital
game
making
has
limited
involvement
with

focuses
on
short-term

and
is

furthermore
there
is

as
to
reflect

in
a
constructive

critical
dialogue
about
the
future
of

as
a
field
of

and
the
ijcci
online
learning

increased
in
2020
driven
by
the
covid-19
pandemic
as
many
researchers
attempted
to
understand
the
impact
stress
had
on
the
emotional
behaviours
and
academic
performance
of
students
most
studies
explored
these
pre-
and
during-covid
behaviours
in
the
context
of
brick
and
mortar
institutions
transitioning
to
online
delivery
there
is
an
opportunity
to
compare
the
experiences
of
students
in
the
mooc
environment
in
this
period
particularly
in
terms
of
the
difference
of
engagement
semantics
and
sentimentstress
behaviours
in
2019
and
2020
in
this
study
we
use
a
dataset
from
adelaidex
between
this
time
period
to
identify
the
most
significant
features
that
impact
student
outcomes
where
previous
machine
learning
approaches
used
singular
features
such
as
student
interaction
or
sentiment
in

forum
posts
we
incorporate
three
feature
categories
of
engagement
semantics
and
sentimentstress
in
an
ensemble
model
is
based
on
voting
and
stacked
methods
to
determining
the
relationship
between
them
and
academic
performance
from
our
results
we
discover
that
sentimentstress
played
little
part
in
academic
performance
and
was
relatively
unchanged
in
online
courses
in
this
dataset
between
2019
and
2020
we
present
two
individual
student
cases
to
further
contextualise
our
findings
artificial
intelligence
ai
has
made
remarkable
strides
giving
rise
to
the
development
of
large
language
models
such
as
chatgpt
the
chatbot
has
garnered
significant
attention
from
academia
industry
and
the
general
public
marking
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
ai
applications
this
work
explores
how
well
chatgpt
can
write
source
code
to
this
end
we
performed
a
series
of
experiments
to
assess
the
extent
to
which
chatgpt
is
capable
of
solving
general
programming
problems
our
objective
is
to
assess
chatgpt’s
capabilities
in
two
different
programming
languages
namely
c
and
java
by
providing
it
with
a
set
of
programming
problem
encompassing
various
types
and
difficulty
levels
we
focus
on
evaluating
chatgpt’s
performance
in
terms
of
code
correctness
run-time
efficiency
and
memory
usage
the
experimental
results
show
that
while
chatgpt
is
good
at
solving
easy
and
medium
programming
problems
written
in
c
and
java
it
encounters
some
difficulties
with
more
complicated
tasks
in
the
two
languages
compared
to
code
written
by
humans
the
one
generated
by
chatgpt
is
of
lower
quality
with
respect
to
runtime
and
memory
usage
since
artificial
intelligence
ai
is
finding
its
way
into
more
and
more
areas
of
everyday
life
improving
the
ai
skills
of
non-experts
is
important
and
will
become
even
more
relevant
in
the
future
while
it
is
necessary
that
children
learn
about
the
possibilities
of
ai
at
an
early
age
adults
in
higher_education
and
beyond
should
also
have
at
least
a
basic
understanding
of
ai
ie
ai
literacy
to
be
able
to
interact
effectively
with
the
technology
to
evaluate
the
current
state
of
the
literature
on
ai
literacy
in
higher
and
adult
education
a
scoping
literature
review
was
conducted
with
the
objective
of
identifying
thematic
foci
and
recent
research
trends
ten
research
databases
were
searched
and
out
of
902
initial
records
30
studies
were
identified
using
predefined
eligibility
criteria
whereof
the
content
was
evaluated
in
the
review
the
results
indicated
that
research
in
this
area
is
still
in
its
infancy
and
needs
refinement
in
terms
of
how
to
define
ai
literacy
in
adult
education
as
well
as
what
content
should
be
taught
to
non-experts
lastly
several
recommendations
for
research
and
practice
are
derived
from
the
results

are
possible
only
if
a

teaching
basic

is
currently
a

focus
in
many

running
parallel
to
this

are
advances
in
programming

teaching
methods
which
aim
to
make
computer

more
accessible
and
more

in
this
paper
we
describe
the
design
and
evaluation
of
flip
a
programming
language
that
aims
to
help
11–15
year
olds
develop
computational
skills
through
creating
their
own
3d
role-playing
games
flip
has
two
main
components
1
a
visual
language
based
on
an
interlocking
blocks
design
common
to
many
current
visual
languages
and
2
a
dynamically
updating
natural
language
version
of
the
script
under
creation
this
programming-languagenatural-language
pairing
is
a
unique
feature
of
flip
designed
to
allow
learners
to
draw
upon
their
familiarity
with
natural
language
to
“decode
the
code”
flip
aims
to
support
young
people
in
developing
an
understanding
of
computational_concepts
as
well
as
the
skills
to
use
and
communicate
these
concepts
effectively
this
paper
investigates
the
extent
to
which
flip
can
be
used
by
young
people
to
create
working
scripts
and
examines
improvements
in
their
expression
of
computational
rules
and
concepts
after
using
the
tool
we
provide
an
overview
of
the
design
and
implementation
of
flip
before
describing
an
evaluation
study
carried
out
with
12–13
year
olds
in
a
naturalistic
setting
over
the
course
of
8
weeks
the
majority
of
students
were
able
to
use
flip
to
write
small
programs
to
bring
about
interactive
behaviours
in
the
games
they
created
furthermore
there
was
a
significant
improvement
in
their
computational
communication
after
using
flip
as
measured
by
a
prepost-test
an
additional
finding
was
that
girls
wrote
more
and
more
complex
scripts
than
did
boys
and
there
was
a
trend
for
girls
to
show
greater
learning
gains
relative
to
the
boys
the
development
in
the
computational
artifacts
social

infrastructure
has
provided
a
unique
opportunity
to
scholars
academicians
and
researchers
to
enhance
their
understanding
of
the
presence
of
“humanities”
in
the
digital

explores
the

summary
background
on

for
90
days
a

became
available
but
its

we
estimated
the

in
seven
sub-saharan
african
ssa
countries—ethiopia
kenya

–
which
together
account
for
about

ssa
methods
we
used
stdsim
an
established
individual-based
simulation
model
and
previously
published
quantifications
for
the
seven
countries
we
predicted
changes
in
hiv
deaths
and
new
infections
over
the
period
2025–2030
for
four
scenarios
1
executive
order—proportional
where
treatment
disruption
was
proportional
to
the
country-specific
pepfars
share
of
total
hiv
funding
2
executive
order—realistic
assuming
near-total
system
collapse
due
to
program
dependencies
and
3–4
waiver
scenarios
where
treatment
was
resumed
after
4
or
after
8
weeks
resumptions
of
programs
accounted
for
delays
due
to
organizational
and
logistical
challenges
findings
a
90-day
funding
freeze
would
result
in
60
thousand
95
ui
49–71

scenario
this
number

ranged
between

interpretation
the
sudden
cessation
of

funding
likely
results
in
tens
of
thousands
of
hiv

these
losses
of

previous
research
has
shown
that
executive
functions
can
contribute
to
successful
problem-solving
in
preschool
and
elementary_school
children
however
most
studies
did
not
simultaneously
assess
the
role
of
different
specific
aspects
of
executive
functions
therefore
the
aim
of
our
study
was
to
investigate
the
individual
contribution
of
inhibition
working

and
cognitive
flexibility
to
science
problem-solving
performance
in

showed
that
working

we
conclude
that
maintaining

problem-solving
phases
cognitive

are
essential
components
of

inhibitory
processes
may
be
more
relevant
in
tasks
involving
a
higher
degree
of
interference
at
the
task
or
response
level
there
has
recently
been
a
renewed
interest
in
integrating
programming
into
the

partly
due

much
remains
to
be
done
to
understand

and
whether

plays
a
role
in

significantly
influencing
both

is
found
to
have
a
significant

the
findings
several
recommendations
are
made

the
last
ten

increasingly
these

the
“cloud”
where
they
can
be
accessed
through
web
browsers
and
run
on
a
variety
of
devices
including

smartphones
the
shift
to

enables
a
variety
of
powerful
pedagogical
features
to
be
incorporated
into
the
design
of
these
learning
environments
including
making
it
easy
to
share

others
and
allow
learners
to
incorporate
various
internet

further
the

itself
can
serve
as
a
productive
canvas
upon
which
novice

can
create
in
the
form
of
dynamic

this
shift
in
venue
for
authoring
and
editing

is
particularly
well-suited
for
young
learners
growing
up
in
an
increasingly
online
world
in
this
paper
we
present
theoretical
and
practical
arguments
for

that
is
based

however
a

is
lacking
to
fill
this
gap
we
reviewed
empirical

include
developing
more
low-tech
maker

the

furthermore
although

dropped
slightly
in

this

only
significant
in

gender
also
seems
to
be
an
important

exhibit
a

motivation
and
a

in

outside

however
this
effect
on

was

observable
in

suggests
that

have
a
positive

giving
an
account
of
the
historic

that
pushed
heterogeneous
parallel
computing
into
the

it
distinguishes
between

many-thread
gpus
the
two
main
styles
of
computing
devices
in
modern
heterogeneous

the
chapter
then
goes
into
the
main
reasons
for
applications
to
demand
more
speed
and
the
amdahl’s
law
an
important
observation
about
the
parallelization
of
real
application
it
then
explains
how
the
book
addresses
the
main
challenges
in
parallel
algorithms
and
parallel
programming
and
how
the
skills
that
have
been
learned
from
the

based
on
cuda
the

is
proposed
the
supporting
computational
model
is
based
on
a
separation
of
individuals
into
actual
possible
and
virtual
ones
as
was
shown
this
leads
to
an
adoption
of
the
stage-by-stage
cognition
model
with
a
pair
of
evolvents
to
capture
dynamics
of
the
domains
–
the
2-dimensions
model
the
first
evolvent
reflects
the
generation
of
the
individuals
in
a
domain
the
beginning
of

canceling
out
their
existence
in
a

the
second
evolvent
reflects
the
shifts
in

as
awaited
this
unified

model
will
have
the
applications
to
a
wide
range
of

been
identified
as
a
contributory
factor
along
with
a
relentless
race
against

fast
scientific
progress
and
unanticipated
challenges
students
in
postsecondary

require
mechanisms
that

and
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
age
after
a
pandemic
that
occurred
during
the
development
of
new
technologies
there
has
been
an
explosion
of
e-learning
platforms
and
methodologies
that
have
been
developed
to
remedy
this
issue
however
not
all
of
them
have
been
as
successful
as
would
be
ideal
this
type
of
new

is
very
difficult
to
execute
properly
it
needs
complex
careful
educational

we
develop

we
found
that
computational

the
principles
closeness

many
block-based
programming
environments
have
proven
to
be
effective
at
engaging
novices
in
learning
programming
however
most
offer
only
restricted
access
to
the
outside
world
limiting
learners
to
commands
and
computing
resources
built
in
to
the
environment
some
allow
learners
to
drag
and
drop
files
connect
to
sensors
and
robots
locally
or
issue
http
requests
but
in
a
world
where
most
of
the
applications
in
our
daily
lives
are
distributed
ie
their
functionality
depends
on
communicating
with
other
computers
or
accessing
resources
and
data
on
the
internet
the
limited
support
for
beginners
to
envision
and
create
such
distributed
programs
is
a
lost
opportunity
we
argue
that
it
is
feasible
to
create
environments
with
simple
yet
powerful
abstractions
that
open
up
distributed
computing
and
other
widely-used
but
advanced
computing
concepts
including
networking
the
internet
of
things
and
cybersecurity
to
novices
the
paper
presents
the
architecture
of
and
design
decisions
behind
netsblox
a
programming
environment
that
supports
these
ideas
we
show
how
netsblox
expands
opportunities
for
learning
considerably
netsblox
projects
can
access
a
wealth
of
online
data
and
web
services
and
they
can
communicate
with
other
projects
moreover
the
tool
infrastructure
enables
young
learners
to
collaborate
with
each
other
during
program
construction
whether
they
share
their
physical
location
or
study
remotely
importantly
providing
access
to
the
wider
world
will
also
help
counter
widespread
student
perceptions
that
block-based
environments
are
mere
toys
and
show
that
they
are
capable
of
creating
compelling
applications
in
this
way
netsblox
offers
an
illuminating
example
of
how
tools
can
be
designed
to
democratize
access
to
powerful
ideas
in
computing
this

the

indicated
that

in
the
experimental
group
the
effect
on
basic

concepts
was
especially
large
in
students
with
moderate

low
self-efficacy
the
implication
is
that
the
vpl
has
extensive
potential
for
programming

in
the
general

the
abstract

platforms
are
very
popular
however
these
platforms
also
have
some
drawbacks
including
that
they
cannot
be
completely
based
on
the
needs
of

many
students
ignore
the
needs
of
students
in
order
to
adapt
to
the
platform
do
not
adopt
a
more
personalized_learning
style
and
do
not

there
are
many
factors
at

and

however
whether
this
model
can
finally
satisfy
teachers
and
students
and
how
the
teaching
effect
is
has
become
a
problem
of
concern
we
propose
a
random
forest-based
method
to
evaluate
college
online
courses
this
method
not
only
focuses
on
a
single
influencing
factor
but
also
takes
into
account
the
special
needs
of
students
and
teachers
and
formulates
different
evaluation
criteria
so
that
the
system
has
not
only
universal
applicability
the
experimental
results
show
that
this
method
can
improve
the
proficiency
and
level
of
teachers
online

and
can
effectively
combine
several

taught
by

skills
are
receiving
widespread
attention
for

however
introducing

concepts
in
an
appropriate
manner
is
a
challenge
in

the
main

is
that
enhancing

potentially
improves

the

is
enriched

the

are
followed
within

who
have
taken
the
introduction
to

course
in
enriched

in

are
evaluated
the
results
show
that
by
slightly
improving

through

students’
performance
on

certainly
complex
with

the
huge

that
allows
appropriate
interpretations
and

to
be
drawn
it
is
unlikely
that
unsupervised

will
allow
for
causal
associations
to
be
made
but
with
proper
study
design
and
appropriate
statistical
and
computational
models
it
should
be
possible
to
derive
meaningful
connections
between
complex

will
undoubtedly
require

this
chapter
outlines
how
the
concept
of
the
smart

is
explored
and
challenged
in
an
undergraduate
design
course
that
adopts
a
cross-scale
framework
to

projects
it
sets
out
an

approach
to
urban

design
that
combines
context-oriented
spatial
design
methods
with
physical
computing
and

principles
it
construes
the

experiments
that
can
materialize
ethical

and
explore
alternate
ways
that

by
outlining
the
themes
that
organize
selected
existing

in
the
following

of
the
book
the
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
explore
the
influence
of
spatial
visualization
skills
when
students
solve
area
tasks
spatial
visualization
is
closely
related
to
mathematics
achievement
but
little
is
known
about
how
these
skills
link
to
task
success
we
examined
middle
school
students’
representations
and
solutions
to
area
problems
both
non-metric
and
metric
through
qualitative
and
quantitative
task
analysis
task
solutions
were
analyzed
as
a
function
of
spatial
visualization
skills
and
links
were
made
between
student
solutions
on
tasks
with
different
goals
ie
non-metric
and
metric
findings
suggest
that
strong
spatial
visualizers
solved
the
tasks
with
relative
ease
with
evidence
for
conceptual
and
procedural
understanding
by
contrast
low
and
average
spatial
students
more
frequently
produced
errors
due
to
failure
to
correctly
determine
linear
measurements
or
apply
appropriate
formula
despite
adequate
procedural
knowledge
a
novel
finding
was
the
facilitating
role
of
spatial
skills
in
the
link
between
metric
task
representation
and
success
in
determining
a
solution
from
a
teaching
and
learning
perspective
these
results
highlight
the
need
to
connect
emergent
spatial
skills
with
mathematical
content
and
support
students
to
develop
conceptual
understanding
in
parallel

however
nowadays

however
apart
from
this

msm
in
the
decade
following
the
introduction
of
art
in
the
netherlands
several
studies
have
been
devoted
to
explain
these
counter-intuitive
trends
in
spvl
however
to
our
knowledge
none
of
these
studies
has
investigated
an
explanation
in
which
it
arises
as
the
result
of
a
sexually
transmitted
infection
sti
co-factor
in
detail
in
this
study
we
adapted
an
event-based
individual-based
model
to
investigate
how
sti
co-infection
and
sexual
risk
behaviour
affect
the
evolution
of
hiv
spvl
in
msm
before
and
after
the
introduction
of
art
the
results
suggest
that
sexual
risk
behaviour
has
an
effect
on
spvl
and
indicate
that
more
data
are
needed
to
test
the
effect
of
sti
co-factors
on
spvl
furthermore
the
observed
trends
in
spvl
cannot
be
explained
by
sexual
risk
behaviour
and
sti
co-factors
only
we
recommend
to
develop
mathematical
models
including
also
factors
related
to
viral
evolution
as
reported
earlier
in
the
literature
however
this
requires
more
complex
models
and
the
collection
of
more
data
for
parameter
estimation
than
what
is
currently
available
this
chapter
introduces
the
book
by
first
giving
an
account
of
the
historic
events
that
pushed
heterogeneous
parallel
computing
into
the
main
stream
it
distinguishes
between
latency-oriented
multicore
cpus
and
throughput
oriented
many-thread
gpus
the
two
main
styles
of
computing
devices
in
modern
heterogeneous
computing
systems
the
chapter
then
goes
into
the
main
reasons
for
applications
to
demand
more
speed
and
the
amdahl’s
law
an
important
observation
about
the
parallelization
of
real
application
it
then
explains
how
the
book
addresses
the
main
challenges
in
parallel
algorithms
and
parallel
programming
and
how
the
skills
learned
from
the
book
based
on
cuda
the
language
of

our
analysis
shows
that
while
there
are
a
number
of
ongoing
initiatives
dedicated
to
developing
instruments

skills
there
are
also
fundamental
challenges
for
the
development
of
relevant
assessments
on
a
systemic
level
and
for
transforming

more
broadly
the
lack
of
representation
from
several
parts
of
the
world
in
international
assessment
initiatives
on
21st
century
skills
is
also
striking
by
taking
a
meta-perspective
we
identify
evolving
themes
within
this
field
and
provide
a
critical
perspective
on
these
developments
we
conclude
there
are
a
number
of
opportunities
and
pitfalls
for
creating
good
synergies
between

this
paper
considers
the
application
of
conceptual
mathematics
to
construct
a
computational
model
of
concepts
and
individuals
an
applicative
approach
is
systematically
applied
to
build
a
concept-as-process
design
since
modern
computing
considers
information
processes
as
the
main
objects
of
modeling
the
developed
design
is
indeed
representative
of
the
semantic
processing
of
information
the
nature
of
concepts
–
what
concepts
are
–
and
the
constraints
that
govern
the
theory
of
concepts
have
been
and
continue
to
be
the
subject
of
debate
it
is
especially
interesting
to
discuss
the
nature
of
concepts
in
connection
with
the
recently
established
fundamental
nature
of
information
processes
that
are
attributable
to
all
phenomena
and
events
occurring
in
the
world
around
us
the
current
trend
elevates
information
processes
to
forms
of
computing
which
can
also
be
implemented
through
practices
for
example
in
the
form
of
programming
the
deep
component
is
computational
models
one
way
or
another
expressed
by
means
of
mathematics
and
metamathematics
the
main
meta-operations
used
are
abstraction
and
application
of
greatest
interest
is
functional
abstraction
and
application
in
the
form
of
applying
a
function
to
an
argument
despite
this
“conceptual
minimalism”
a
rich
theory
of
concepts
can
be
developed
using
this
theory
it
is
possible
to
focus
further
discussion
not
only
on
the
nature
of
concepts
but
also
to
characterize
the
position
on
each
of
the
five
important
issues
that
are
central
to
many
theories
of
concepts
1
ontology
of

2
structure
of

3

to
be

jointly
construct

that
they
then
integrate
into

games
using

such
as
textbooks
world
maps
google
and

the
article
shows
how
designing
games
about
historical
topics
is
a
complex
process
in
which
students
use
artifacts
as
the
basis
for
knowledge
claims
and
storytelling
and
students
need
to
negotiate
and
balance
their
own
design
preferences
with
historical
accuracy
and
the
expectations
of
the

exist
that
have
been
specifically
created
to
enable

involve
the
simultaneous

but
few
youth-focused

tools
have
been
designed
to
support
this

we
describe
the

that
addresses
both
of
these

of
attention
as
an
important
source
of
creative

which
indicates
that
most
remixes
are
at
a
low
creative
level
second
the
internal
characteristics
of
projects
are
related
to
the
lower
creative
level
of
remix
while
the
external

are
attached
to
the
higher
creative
level
of
remix
finally
the
two-level
three-level
and
four-level
iteration
chain
of
remixes
are
found
in
which
remixes
with
high
creativity
is
more
likely
to
inspire
remixes
with
lower
or
equal
creativity
based
on
these
results
suggestions
for
further
research

these

the

we
present
a

where
we
employed
text-to-text
text-to-image
and
image-to-image
generative
tools
for
a
conceptual

project
for

we
trained
these

on
a

that
we
collected
and
curated
consisting
of
texts
about

of

we
describe

present
the
final
proposal
reflect
on
the
usefulness
of
such

for
early-stage

and
discuss
implications
for
future
research
and
practice
by
analysing
the
results
from
training
the
text-to-text
generators
we
could
establish
a
specific

brief
that
informed
the
final

the
results
from
the

generator
gave
an
overview
of

all

were
intriguing
and
can
assist

and
in
this
way
the
tools
were
useful
for
gaining
insight
into
historical
architectural
data
helped
shape
a
specific

brief
and
provoked
new
ideas
by
reflecting
on
our
design
process
we
argue
that
the
use
of
language
when
employing
such
tools
takes
a
new
role
and
that
three
layers
of

intertwined
in

we
present

digital
well-being
traditionally
means
limiting
the
effects
on
individuals
of
technology
abuses
however
in
a
broader
perspective
it
can
be
crucial
to
consider
the
pervasiveness
of
technology
and
the
effect
it
can
have
not
only
on
individuals
but
also
on
their
peers
in
the
context
of
diverse
everyday-life
situations
within
this
view
which
emphasises
the
social
side
of
digital
well-being
the
paper
argues
the
need
of
educating
young
generations
to
participate
in
the
making
of
technology
for
a
social
goal
and
have
a
reflective
attitude
towards
technology
and
its
impact
on
society
it
therefore
presents
a
design
toolkit
as
a
means
to
i
engage
young
generations
to
become
active
in
design
for
social
digital
well-being
and
thanks
to
the
exposure
to
how
technology
works
ii
reflect
deeply
on
the
pros
and
cons
of
technology
in
use
in
their
everyday
life
by
presenting
the
results
of
a
study
with
24
high-school
pupils
and
their
teachers
the
paper
discusses
how
a
phygital
toolkit
which
structures
the
design
process
engages
them
in
the
rapid
prototyping
of
their
own
smart
things
and
how
it
acts
as
a
proxy
for
soliciting
their
own
reflections
around
technology
and
social
digital
well-being
while
the
study
of
global
governance
is
moving
from
a
focus
on
component-dominated
to
interaction-dominated
systems
the
present
paper
reviews
development
in
governance
theories
from
a
complexity
perspective
and
discuss
how
governance
systems
can
be
represented
in
terms
of

such
representation
is
useful
to
foster

the
topic
of
social

is
still
an

area
this
study
adopts
the
theoretical
lens
of
new

studies
to
suggest
a
combined
perspective
for
investigating
social

literacies
this
perspective
considers
both
social

that
are
transversal
across
different

and
those
that
pertain
to
a

also
using
a
critical

based
on
four
metaphors
whereby
for
learning
purposes
social

are
seen
as
a
tool
as
a
process
as
collaboration
and
as

the
results
show
that
most
of
the

consider
global
social

skills
while
only
a
few
examine
skills

we
conclude
that
there
is
a
need
for

provide
a
number
of
recommendations
for

finland
and
the
other
in
hong
kong
china
–
during
the
development
of
an
international
university
course
on

the
objective
of
the
study
was
to
examine
international
students’
changing
conceptual
understanding
of
artificial
intelligence
ai
literacy
as
part
of
the
course
the
need
for
this
study
arose
from
the
recent
rapid
spread
of
ai
across
industries
which
has
connected
human
learning
to
machine
learning
this
requires
competence
in
ai
to
contribute
to

five
hours
of
online
lectures
on
ai

were
delivered
during
two
workshops
to
students
n
29
from
13
countries
with
no
or
limited
prior
knowledge
of
the
subject
in
2021
and
2022
the
participants
filled
out
pre-
and
post-workshop
quantitative
questionnaires
and
wrote
diaries
about
their
learning
process
the
development
of
their
understanding
of
ai-literacy
concepts
and
their
thoughts
on
the
pedagogical
approaches
used
the
quantitative
data
were
analysed
using
a
paired-samples
t-test
while
the
qualitative
data
were
examined
using
thematic-content
analysis
the
findings
show
that
the
students’
knowledge
of
ai
and
their
awareness
of
the
importance
of
ai
literacy
and
media
education
increased
significantly
further
research
is
needed
so
that
a
more
appropriate
curriculum
can
be
designed
for
them
we
outline
some
key
activities
that
offer
interactive
and
participatory
ways
to
learn
ai
in
order
to
assist
educators
in
planning
and
delivering
ai-literacy
courses
as
part
of
cross-cultural
media
education
research
suggests
that
children
can
learn
educational
concepts
from
well-designed
applications
apps
including
foundational
science
technology
engineering
and
math
stem
concepts
parents
may
be
important
for
promoting
childrens
stem
learning
from
touchscreen
apps
as
parents
can
help
their
children
learn
from
other
media
however
little
research
has
explored
how
parents
and
children
use
coding
apps
together
for
learning
and
whether
specific
parent-child
interactions
in
these
contexts
promote
childrens
learning
from
apps
therefore
we
observed
31
parents
and
their
45-
to
50-year
old
children
playing
a
coding
app
together
and
coded
for
spatial
talk
question-asking
task-relevant
talk
and
responsiveness
results
show
that
parents
and
children
engaged
in
high-quality
interactions
during
coding
app
play
with
parents
and
children
exhibiting
high
responsiveness
and
task-relevant
talk
and
parents
exhibiting
a
higher
proportion
of
question-asking
and
spatial
talk
compared
to
their
children
importantly
linear
regression
analyses
show
that
the
dyads
ability
to
stay
on
task
during
the
coding
task
predicts
childrens
learning
of
coding
while
question-asking
was
a
negative
predictor
of
childrens
learning
these
results
suggest
that
coding
apps
may
be
a
rich
context
for
stem
learning
and
that
specific
parent-child
interactions
can
scaffold
their
childrens
learning
from
stem
apps

presents
a

to
young
adolescents
using
a
dataset
involving
over
2500
6th

the

shows
that
scientific

scores
can
predict

and
that
this

is
consistent
across

further
students
who
are

are
having
a

digital
fabrication
and
making
has
received
a
growing
interest
in
formal
and
informal
learning
environments
however
many
of
these
initiatives
often
start
from
a
grassroots
perspective
with
little
coordination
on
a
national
level
this
paper
illustrates
and
discusses
a
study
from
an
ongoing
large-scale
national
testbed
in
sweden
named
makerspace
in
schools
makerskola
the
project
embodies
a
series
of
considerations
that
arise
when
a
maker
approach
is
applied
to
a
geographically
widespread
national
education
context
the
results
of
this
study
are
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
extensive
project
documentation
and
first-hand
experiences
from
initiating
and
running
a
large-scale
national
testbed
in
sweden
involving
more
than
30
formal
actors
and
more
than
one
thousand
active
partners
in
a
national
educational
setting
the
main
contribution
of
this
paper
is
the
identification
and
discussion
of
five
different
considerations
that
have
emerged
during
the
project
and
include
procurement
practices
the
teacher
and
leader
perspective
informing
national
policy
making
creating
equal
opportunities
and
progression
in
digital
fabrication
despite
the
multiple
deep
knowledge
tracing
dkt
methods
developed
for
intelligent
tutoring
systems
and
online
learning
environments
there
exists
only
a
few
applications
of
such
methods
in
educational
computer
games
one
key
challenge
is
that
a
player
may
deploy
several
interweaved
and
overlapped
skills
during
gameplay
making
the
assessment
task
nontrivial
in
this
research
we
present
a
generalizable
dkt
approach
called
gamedkt
that
integrates
state-of-the-art
machine
learning
with
domain
knowledge
to
model
the
learners’
knowledge
state
during
gameplay
in
an
attempt
to
monitor
and
trace
their
proficiency
level
for
the
different
skills
required
for
educational
games
our
findings
reveal
that
gamedkt
approach
could
successfully
predict
the
performance
of
players
in
the
coming
game
task
using
the
cross-validated
cnn
model
with
accuracy
and
auc
of
roughly
85
and
0913
respectively
thus
outperforming
the
mlp
baseline
model
by
up
to
14
when
the
performance
of
players
is
forecasted
for
up
to
four
game
tasks
in
advance
results
show
that
the
cnn
model
can
achieve
more
than
70
accuracy
interestingly
this
model
seems
to
be
better
and
faster
at
identifying
local
patterns
and
it
could
achieve
a
higher
performance
compared
to
rnn
and
lstm
in
both
one-step
and
multi-step
prediction
of
learners’
performance
in
game
tasks
the
use
of
theory
and
simulation
in
undergraduate
education
in
biochemistry
molecular
biology
and
structural
biology
is
now
common
but
the
skills
students
need
and
the
curriculum
instructors
have
to
train
their
students
are
evolving
the
global
pandemic
and
the
immediate
switch
to
remote
instruction
forced
instructors
to
reconsider
how
they
can
use
computation
to
teach
concepts
previously
approached
with
other
instructional
methods
in
this
review
we
survey
some
of
the
curricula
materials
and
resources
for
instructors
who
want
to
include
theory
simulation
and
computation
in
the
undergraduate
curriculum
there
has
been
a
notable
progression
from
teaching
students
to
use
discipline-specific
computational
tools
to
developing
interactive
computational
tools
that
promote
active
learning
to
having
students
write
code
themselves
such
that
they
view
computation
as
another
tool
for
solving
problems
we
are
moving
toward
a
future
where
computational
skills
including
programming
data
analysis
visualization
and
simulation
will
no
longer
be
considered
an
optional
bonus
for
students
but
a
required
skill
for
the
21st
century

notice
the
increasing
adoption
of
programming
education
necessitates
efficient
and
accurate
methods
for
evaluating
students’
coding
assignments
traditional
manual
grading
is
time-consuming
often
inconsistent
and
prone
to
subjective
biases
this
paper
explores
the
application
of
large
language
models
llms
for
the
automated
evaluation
of

assignments
llms
can
use
advanced
natural
language
processing
capabilities
to
assess
code
quality
functionality
and
adherence
to
best
practices
providing
detailed
feedback
and

we
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
llms
through
experiments
comparing
their
performance
with
human
evaluators
across
various
programming
tasks
our
study
evaluates
the
performance
of

respectively
both

correlate
highly
with

exhibit
low
accuracy
and

particularly
in
problem-solving
tasks
these
findings
suggest
that
advanced
llms
are
instrumental
in
scalable
automated
educational
assessment
additionally
llms
enhance
the
learning
experience
by
offering
personalized
instant

using
computational

to
produce

interpret
multiple
scientific

is
now
a
common
practice
in
many
science
disciplines
research
has
shown
students
have
difficulty
in
moving
across
connecting
and
sensemaking
from
multiple
representations
there
is
a
need
to
develop
task-specific
representational
competencies
for
students
to
reason
and
conduct
scientific
investigations
using
multiple
representations
in
this
study
we
focus
on
three
representational
competencies
1
linking
between
representations
2
disciplinary
sensemaking
from
multiple
representations
and
3
conceptualizing
domain-relevant
content
derived
from
multiple
representations
we
developed
a
block
code-based
computational
modeling
environment
with
three
different
representations
and
embedded
it
within
an
online
activity
for
students
to
carry
out
investigations
around
the
earthquake
cycle
the
three
representations
include
a
procedural
representation
of
block
codes
a
geometric
representation
of
land
deformation
build-up
and
a
graphical
representation
of
deformation
build-up
over

we
examined
the
extent
of
students
representational
competencies
and
which
competencies
are
most
correlated
with
students’
future
performance
in
a
computationally
supported
geoscience
investigation
results
indicate
that
a
majority
of
the
431
students
showed
at
least
some
form
of
representational
competence
however
a
relatively
small
number
of
students
showed
sophisticated
levels
of
linking
sensemaking
and
conceptualizing

the
representations
five
of

were
significantly
correlated
to

performance
on
a
summative
geoscience
investigation
we
argue
that
that
the
use
of
the
carnap
-
bar-hillel
principle
of
indexed
expressions
provides
a
suitable
cognitive
model
to
undergo
the

of
information
processes
in
the
semantic
net
to
understand
the
stratification
of
the
net
into
the
surface
web
and
the
hidden
web
a
model
structure
is
proposed
that
provides
navigation
through
the

as
a
whole
for
logical
expressions
a
relativized

map
is
given
which
is
parameterized
by
the

to
use
concepts
that
are

the
variables
of
which
run
over
the
range
of
possible
individual
information
processes
a
generalized
operator
providing
virtualization
is
presented
for
individuals
the
process
is
accompanied
with
the
dynamic
generation
of
web-pages
which
triggers
their
indexing
this
way
they
are
thereby
transferred
to
the
surface
layer
of
the
network
a
commutative
diagram
is
proposed
that
establishes
a
cognitive
model
of
semantic
constructions
of
variable
domains
the
connection
of
virtual
individuals
with
actual
ones
which
corresponds
to
transitions
over
the
stages
of

the

stages
are
modeled
by

this
paper
presents
the
effect
of
meaningful

contexts
and
hands-on
activities
facilitated
using
two
robots
that
work
with
people
co-robots
in
broadening
and
sustaining
pre-college
student
engagement
in
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem
the
two
co-robots
are
1
a
glider
for
underwater
problem-solving
and
promotion
of
interest
in
engineering
or
guppie
and
2
a
neurally
controlled
manipulator
called
neu-pulator
the
co-robots
are
easy
and
inexpensive
to
manufacture
with
readily
available
lightweight
and
durable
components
they
are
also
modular
to
accommodate
a
variety
of
learning
activities
that
help
young
students
to
learn
crosscutting
concepts
and
engineering
practice
the
early
assessment
results
show
that
students’
interests
in
activities
related
to
robotics
depend
on
their
perception
of
the
difficulty
and
their
confidence
level
the
key
is
to
start
early
when
the
students
are
young
the
challenge
is
to
break
the
barriers
and
define
tasks
as
fun
activities
with
a
learn
and
play
approach
that
can
be
rewarding
in
this
work
using
a
meaningful
context
–
as
in
co-robots
that
help
humans
–
in
a
hands-on
project-based
program
that
integrates
different
aspect
of
design
science
and
technology
is
found
effective
in
increasing
students’
enthusiasm
and
participation
the
co-robots
and
the
hands-on
activities
can
be
easily
adopted
in
classrooms
by
teachers
with
no
engineering
background
who
seek
innovative
ways
to
connect
interdisciplinary
core
ideas
and
standards
to
the
concepts
they
need
to
teach
with
the
advancement
of
technology
emerging
technologies
like
artificial
intelligence
ai
have
also
been
growing
rapidly
and
becoming
more
common
than
ever
before
kenya
has
taken
tremendous
steps
in
adopting
the
use
of
emerging
technology
in
different
sectors
of
the
economy
in
realization
of
the
need
to
have
a
skilled
digital
workforce
to
develop
solutions
using
these
emerging
technologies
kenya
has
undertaken
curriculum
reforms
and
introduced
the
competency-based
curriculum
cbc
which
has
included
digital
literacy
and
coding
in
elementary_school
furthermore
computer
science
has
been
introduced
in
junior
secondary_school
in
view
of
these
changes
teachers
should
be
adequately
prepared
with
knowledge
skills
and
attitudes
to
effectively
teach
these
new
technologies
however
in
kenya
ai
was
not
and
still
is
not
part
of
the
teacher
training
curriculum
additionally
there
are
inadequate
professional
development
opportunities
in
ai
for
both
pre-service
and
in-service
teachers
since
ai
is
not
part
of
the
cbc
curriculum
that
notwithstanding
it
is
inevitable
for
teachers
in
the
current
world
to
introduce
ai
to
learners
therefore
this
studys
objectives
were
to
assess
the
confidence
in
ai
attitudes
toward
ai
ai
ethics
subjective
norms
perceived
threats
and
the
readiness
to
teach
ai
among
kenyan
k-12
in-service
teachers
and
to
assess
how
these
factors
influence
their
readiness
to
teach
ai
to
achieve
these
objectives
this
study
employed
a
quantitative
research
methodology
by
administering
a
survey
using
google
forms
to
a
random
sample
of
308
teachers
from
different
grades
from
37
out
of
47
counties
in
kenya
the
findings
showed
that
confidence
in
ai
ai
ethics
and
subjective
norms
significantly
influenced
ai
readiness
while
attitude
towards
ai
and
perceived
threats
did
not
significantly
influence
ai
readiness
these
results
are
significant
in
providing
a
basis
for
education
policy
change
on
ai
education
in
kenya
such
as
transforming
the
teacher
training
curriculum
to
include
ai
and
designing
ai
professional
development
programs
for
in-service
teachers
to
ensure
they
are
well-equipped

significantly
accelerated
the
digitalization
of

integrating
digital

worldwide
this
expansion
of

is
intertwined
with

play
an
increasingly
prominent

this

analyses
the
digital

landscape
in

with
critical
insights
into
the
governance
dynamics
shaping

in
this
paper
we
offer
an
investigation
of
the
nuances
of
adult–child
interactions
at
a
computational
science
exhibit
in
a
canadian
science
museum
the
theoretical
lens
of
joint
activity
allows
us
to
understand
learning
to
code
as
a
collaborative
intergenerational
activity
distributed
between
learners
educators
exhibit
hardware
and
the
computer
code
itself
specifically
we
attend
to
the
ways
in
which
children
can
be
centered
at
the
computational
science
exhibit
moments
in
which
their
goals
histories
and
desires
are
driving
the
exhibit’s
interaction
by
the
actions
of
parents
and
museum
facilitators
or
be
decentered
by
them
through
qualitative
analysis
of
video-recorded
interactions
of
adults
and
children
at
the
exhibit
we
present
categories
of
centering
or
decentering
interactions
while
preserving
the
nuance
and
ambiguity
involved
in
sociocultural
contexts
of
learning
we
also
highlight
two
cases
that
illustrate
the
complexity
and
heterogeneity
involved
in
facilitating
a
computational
science
exhibit
we
close
with
a
discussion
and
a
call
to
eschew
technocentric
views
of
computing
education
that
focus
solely
on
device-level
engagement
and
instead
attend
to
the
complex
human–human
interactions
involved
in
computing
education
visual
diagrammatic
programming
and
block
diagrams
have
been
indispensable
tools
for
systems
modeling
and
simulation
across
research
development
and
educational
fields
for
several
decades
despite
the
availability
of
mature
commercial
and
free
software
tools
there
is
a
lack
of
information
publicly
accessible
on
algorithms
for
processing
block
diagrams
that
represent
dynamical
systems
and
simulate
the
corresponding
models
a
gap
in
the
existing
literature
is
the
absence
of
mathematically
formal
and
complete
proposals
of
algorithms
for
processing
block
diagrams
that
are
multigraphs
containing
directed
cyclic
graphs
and
not
just
simpler
directed
graphs
the
lack
of
a
detailed
exposition
concerning
the
practical
implementation
of
such
algorithms
is
also
a
gap
this
gap
is
likely
because
the
simulation
systems
based
on
block
diagram
descriptions
that
have
become
de
facto
industry
standards
use
proprietary
solutions
even
if
their
origins
can
be
traced
back
to
work
done
in
research
centers
and
universities
more
than
seven
decades
ago
in
response
to
these
challenges
this
paper
summarizes
the
historical
evolution
of
related
paradigms
such
as
data
flow
diagrams
signal
flow
graphs
bond
graphs
and
block
diagrams
we
propose
a
general
algorithm
for
block
diagram
processing
and
present
an
open-source
software
tool
for
python
that
implements
a
diagrammatic
visual
programming
interface
and
the
proposed
block
diagram
processing
algorithm
the
key
contributions
to
the
field
of
systems
modeling
and
simulation
can
be
summarized
as
follows
firstly
the
exposition
of
the
algorithm
formally
proving
its
correctness
offers
transparency
which
facilitates
further
research
and
development
in
the
field
enabling
academics
and
professionals
to
adapt
enhance
or
expand
upon
the
existing
capabilities
of
the
tool
secondly
the
implementation
of
a
python
library
and
tool
released
as
an
open-source
solution
for
simulating
signal
processing
and
dynamical
systems
through
block
diagrams
by
integrating
the
proposed
algorithm
capable
of
efficiently
handling
multigraph
representations
including
those
with
directed
cyclic
graphs
ensuring
accessibility
of
the
tool
to
researchers
developers
and
educators
fosters
innovation
research
and
empowers
educators
by
providing
them
with
a
versatile
tool
that
can
be
used
to
teach
complex
systems
modeling
and
simulation
concepts
in
a
practical
hands-on
manner
across
various
domains
such
as

summary
characterizing
sars-cov-2
evolution
in
specific
geographies
may
help
predict
properties
of
the
variants
that
come
from
these
regions
we
mapped
neutralization
of
a
sars-cov-2
strain
that
evolved
over
6
months
from
ancestral
virus
in
a
person
with
advanced
hiv
disease
in
south
africa
this
person
was
infected
prior
to
emergence
of
the
beta
and
delta
variants
we
longitudinally
tracked
the
evolved
virus
and
tested
it
against
self-plasma
and
convalescent
plasma
from
ancestral
beta
and
delta
infections
early
virus
was
similar
to
ancestral
but
it
evolved
a
multitude
of
mutations
found
in
omicron
and
other
variants
it
showed
substantial
but
incomplete
pfizer

escape
weak
neutralization
by
self-plasma
and
despite
pre-dating
delta
it
also
showed
extensive
escape
of
delta
infection-elicited
neutralization
this
example
is
consistent
with
the
notion
that
sars-cov-2
evolving
in
individual
immune-compromised
hosts
including
those
with
advanced
hiv
disease
may
gain
immune
escape
of
vaccines
and
enhanced
escape
of
delta
immunity
and
this
has
implications
for
vaccine
breakthrough

reinfections
this
paper
argues
that
while
universities
have
a
crucial
role
to
play
in
social
innovation
by
democratizing
knowledge
fulfilling
that
role
in
the
global
south
requires
them
to
partner
with
civil
society
actors
such
as
ngos
with
their
history
of
working
with
the
socially
disadvantaged
ngos
have
a
unique
role
in
clarifying
the
nature
of
demand
since
social
innovation
must
often
address
ill-formulated
“wicked
problems”
similarly
ngos
can
fill
the
“institutional
voids”
which
limit
socioeconomic
transactions
in
the
global
south
the
paper
discusses
the
wicked
nature
of
visual-impairment
which
is
both
widely
prevalent
and
has
biopsychosocial
attributes
ie
the
functional
limitations
are
reinforced
by
the
psychological
perceptions
of
the
blind
and
visually
impaired
bvi
and
the
sociological
stigma
of

are
being
formulated
within
a

furthermore
both
students
and
teacher
perceived
a
negative
influence
from
chatgpt
usage
on

the
findings
suggest
that

should
be
formulated
in
more

and
be
expanded
to
include
the
use
of

complex
programming
assignments
remain
appropriate
in

education
but
pair_programming
as
a
didactic
approach
should
be
reconsidered
in
light
of
the
growing
use
of
ai
chatbots
the
maker
movement
has
gathered
much
attention
recently
and
has
been
one
of
the
fastest-growing
topics
due
to
contemporary
technical
and
infrastructural
developments
the
maker
culture
can
be
described
as
a
philosophy
in
which
individuals
or
groups
of
individuals
create
artifacts
that
are
recreated
and
assembled
using
software
andor
physical
objects
typical
topics
of
interest
in
maker
culture
include
engineering-oriented
pursuits
such
as
electronics
robotics
3d
printing
and
computer
numerical
control
tools
as
well
as
more
traditional
activities
such
as
sewing
or
arts
and
crafts
scholars
and
educators
have
reported
a
variety
of
outcomes
from
the
maker
movement
as
an
instructional
process
however
the
lack
of
a
summary
of
these
empirical

prevents
stakeholders
from
having
a
clear
view
of
the
benefits
and

this
study
began
with
concerns
about
mis-disinformation
in
the
new
media
environment
as
we
sought
ways
to
combat
unreliable

we
developed
an
online
educational
game
designed
to
enhance
core
media
and
information
literacy
competencies
and
to
help
young
adults
become
information

citizens
we
examined
the

effects
on
skepticism
toward

and
information
discernment
skills
two
of
the
most
important
mil
competencies
in
an
online
experiment
a
total
of
210
participants
between
20

29
years
of
age
were
randomly
assigned
to
one
of
three
groups
the

that
played
the
developed

group
that
completed
a

and
the

that
did
not

the
participants
perceived

were
measured
with
a
pre-questionnaire
after

skills
as
learning
outcomes
were
measured
with
survey
items
on
skepticism
toward
online

and
an
information
discernment
skills
test
respectively
the
results
showed
that
the
game
effectively
enhanced
the
cognitive
aspect
of
media
and
information
literacy
information
discernment
skills
but
not
the
attitudinal
aspect
skepticism
toward

in
addition
the
game
was
found
to
be
effective
regardless
of
the
participants
perceived
level
of
intellectual
civic
skills
while
quiz
with
no
game
element
was
found
to
be
effective
only
when
the
participants
perceived
level
of
intellectual
civic
skills
was
high
these
findings
demonstrate
the
importance
of
digital
game-based
intervention
as
an
educational
resource
we
extend
our
discussion
to
the
advantages
and
limitations
of
games
in
fostering
learners
abilities
to
evaluate
online
information
we
study
the
dynamics
of
the
field
equations
in
a
five-dimensional
spatially
flat
friedmann–lemaître–robertson–walker
metric
in
the
context
of
a
gauss–bonnet–scalar
field
theory
where
the
quintessence
scalar
field
is
coupled
to
the
gauss–bonnet
scalar
contrary
to
the
four-dimensional
gauss–bonnet
theory
where
the
gauss–bonnet
term
does
not
contribute
to
the
field
equations
in
this
five-dimensional
einstein–scalar–gauss–bonnet
model
the
gauss–bonnet
term
contributes
to
the
field
equations
even
when
the
coupling
function
is
a
constant
additionally
we
consider
a
more
general
coupling
described
by
a
power-law
function
for
the
scalar
field
potential
we
consider
the
exponential
function
for
each
choice
of
the
coupling
function
we
define
a
set
of
dimensionless
variables
and
write
the
field
equations
into
a
system
of
ordinary
differential
equations
we
perform
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
dynamics
for
both
systems
and
classify
the
stability
of
the
equilibrium
points
we
determine
the
presence
of
scaling
and
super-collapsing
solutions
using
the
cosmological
deceleration
parameter
this
means
that
our
models
can
explain
the
universe’s
early
and
late-time
acceleration
phases
consequently
this
model
can
be
used
to
study
inflation
or
as
a
dark

candidate
studies
on
maker

broadening
the
debate
on
the

noteworthy
is
the
importance
of
teacher
training
for
a
better
understanding
of

education
and
a
greater

makerspace
as
an
environment
that
promotes

is
an
emerging

indicating
that
there
is
still
a

new

can
play
a
key
role
in

a
class
of

named
“enactive”
aims
to
support
fluid
interaction
between
technology
and

via

cycles
—
the
effect
of

on
the
human
agent
is
fed
back
by
the
human
action
on
the

—
based
on
the
use
of

we
have
extended
this
concept
in
a
long-term
project
on
socioenactive
systems
by
emphasizing
social
aspects
in
the
enactive
phenomena
in
this
article
we
investigate
how
a
robot-based
experience
can
promote
social
behavior
among
children
in
an
educational
context
the
study
was
conducted
in
workshops
with
26
children
4–5
years

indicate
that
505
of

were
the
result
of
children-children

group-robot
interactions
compared
to
the

the
utility
of
biomedical
information
retrieval
environments
can
be
severely
limited
when
users
lack
expertise
in
constructing
effective

queries
to
address
this
issue
we
developed
a
computer-based
query
recommendation
algorithm
that
suggests
semantically
interchangeable
terms
based
on
an
initial
user-entered
query
in
this
study
we
assessed
the
value
of
this
approach
which
has
broad
applicability
in
biomedical

by
demonstrating
its
application
as
part
of
a

that
facilitates

of

the

challenges
persist
for
users
to
construct

when
retrieving

from

including
those
from

this
study
demonstrates
that
semantically-based
query
recommendation
is
a
viable
solution
to
addressing
this
challenge
since
the
social
cognitive
model
of
well-being
in
academicwork
settings
was
proposed
more
and
more
studies
have
supported
its
validity
nevertheless
most

failed
to
test
the
temporal
precedence
of
its
core
variables
related
to
individual
career
development
thus
we
aimed
to
test
this
model
among
1512

with

self-efficacy
cdse
career
commitment
making
and
well-being
moreover
the

indicated
that
t1
career-related
parental

was
linked
to

and
that

studying
the
multifractal
characteristics
of
the
tbm
operational
parameters
can
help
identify
the
patterns
but
the
relevant
research
has
not
yet
been
explored
this
paper
proposed
a
novel
classification
model
for
quality
grades
of
surrounding
rock
in
tbm
tunnels
based
on
multifractal
analysis
theory
initially
the
statistical
characteristics
of
eight
tbm
cycle
data
with
different
grades
of
surrounding
rock
were
explored
subsequently
the
method
of
calculating
and
analyzing
the
multifractal
characteristic
parameters
of
the
tbm
operational
data
was
deduced
and
summarized
the
research
results
showed
that
the
tbm
operational
parameters
of
cutterhead
torque
total
thrust
advance
rate
and
cutterhead
rotation
speed
have
significant
multifractal
characteristics
its
multifractal
dimension
midpoint
slope
of
the
generalized
fractal
spectrum
and
singularity
strength
range
can
be
used
to
evaluate
the
surrounding
rock
grades
of
the
tunnel
finally
a
novel
classification
model
for
the
tunnel
surrounding
rocks
based
on
the
multifractal
characteristic
parameters
was
proposed
using
the
multiple
linear
regression
method
and
the
model
was
verified
through
four
tbm
cycle
data
containing
different
surrounding
rock
grades
the
results
showed
that
the
proposed
multifractal-based
classification
model
for
tunnel
surrounding
rocks
has
high
accuracy
and
applicability
this
study
not
only
achieves
multifractal
feature
representation
and
surrounding
rock
classification
for
tbm
operational
parameters
but
also
holds
the
potential
for

in
these
settings
children
have
to
work
relatively
independent
from

this
can
be
challenging
due

the
need
for
securing
human

acquired
with

is
becoming
a
very
important
issue
in
usa
england
japan
india
and
israel
improving
students’
ict
competency
has
become
a
pedagogical
issue
accordingly
education
on
ict
competency
is
changing
in
many
countries
emphasizing
the
basis
of
computer
science
the
korean
government
revised
the
ict
curriculum
of
2001
focused
on
the
basic
concepts
and
principles
of
computer
science
as
educational
policy
in
2005
however
it
is
still
difficult
to
determine
a
student’s
ict
competency
level
and
the
outcome
of
ict
curriculum
based
on
changed
direction
thereupon
this

has
developed
test

for
measuring
the
level
of
korean
elementary_school

are
established
as
the

there
were
several
findings
made
in

korea’s
elementary_school
students
have
a
weakness
in
‘algorithm

modeling’
information
processing
stage
has
been
found
to
vary

is
used
to
confirm
the

the
cutoff
score
employed
to

the
ratio
of
excellent

decreases
and
the
ratio
of

increases
in
higher

to
solve
these
problems
we
need
to
emphasize
algorithmic_thinking
oriented
more
principal
of

for
more
effective
ict
elementary

be
introduced
the
integration
of
artificial

ai
as
a
subject
into
k-12
education
worldwide
is
still
in
its
early
stages
and
undoubtedly
needs
further
investigation
there
is
limited
effort
on
understanding
policymakers
teachers
and
students’
viewpoints
on
ai
learning
within
the

this

gathered
the
thoughts
of
key

higher_education
and
k-12
teachers
and
students
in
nigeria
to
understand
their
conceptions

with
the
aim
of
aiding
the
implementation
of
ai
in

we
further
explored
the
needs
of
the
diverse
stakeholders
how
they
can
be
supported
and
juxtaposed
their
views
to
identify
their
priorities
and
how
their
opinions
combined
could
give
a
holistic
approach
to
the
effective
implementation
of

education
this
research
employed
a
qualitative
methodology
using
semi-structured

the
means
of

what
they
considered

concerns
and
support
needed
to
implement
ai
in

the
findings
of
this

contribute
to
the
ongoing
conversation
on
how
to
effectively
integrate

2
identify

and
3
draw
out
opportunities
for

in
this
specific
area
a
systematic
literature
review
was
conducted
on
five
search

resulting
in
a
set
of
703
articles
which
were
screened
and
filtered
in
a
systematic
way
until
they
were
narrowed
to
a
corpus
of
65
articles
for
further
analysis
the
synthesis
identify
several
key
findings
1
there
is
diversity
of
technology
supports
available
for
children
with
down
syndrome
targeting
individual
capabilities
2
overlapping
definitions
of
technology
makes
it
difficult
to
place
technology
supports
in
individual
categories
rather
than
subsets
of
a
broader
term
3
the
average
sample
size
remained
small
for
participants
in
the
studies
making
it
difficult
to
draw
solid
conclusions
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
related
interventions
4
the
distribution
of
papers
indicates
that
this
is
an
emerging
area
of
research
and
is
starting
to
build
body
of
knowledge
and
5
there
are
limited
studies
on
newer
emerging
technologies
which
requires
further
investigation
to
explore
their
potential
information
and
communication
technology
ict
literacy
is
key
to
solving
future
societal
challenges
and
to
leading
an
independent
and
responsible
life
in
an
increasingly
globalized
and
digitalized
world
hence
countries
around
the
world
have
promoted
research
on
students
ict
skills
and
their
inclusion
in
curricula
despite
these
efforts
little
is
known
about
what
predicts
future
ict
literacy
and
prior
research
has
almost
exclusively
conducted
cross-sectional
studies
in
the
present
study
we
addressed
this
gap
by
using
data
from
a
large-scale
longitudinal
study
of
6810
students
in
311
schools
from
germany
these
students
participated
in
the
national
educational
panel
study
over
the
course
of
secondary_school
in
grades
6
9
and
12
we
were
particularly
interested
in
investigating
potential
spillover
effects
from
skills
and
dispositions
that
are
inherently
fostered
in
school
on
ict
development
thus
we
considered
a
rich
set
of
different
types
of
predictors
related
to
the
students
social
cultural
demographic
and
learning
backgrounds
their
subject-specific
motivation
and
the
composition
of
their
schools
and
we
assessed
the
extent
to
which
these
variables
explained
variation
in
ict
literacy
development
at
two
key
stages
in
the
educational
system
grades
9
and
12
our
results
indicated
that
prior
ict
literacy
was
the
most
important
predictor
of
future
ict
literacy
but
more
so
for
the
development
between
grades
9
and
12
in
addition
variables
related
to
the
students
learning
backgrounds
followed
by
variables
related
to
the
composition
of
their
schools
and
students
subject-specific
motivation
explained
future
ict
literacy
overall
the
predictors
explained
between
49
and
67
of
the
variation
in
future
ict
literacy
our
longitudinal
findings
suggest
that
the
learning
environment
and
students’
skills
and
dispositions
are
crucial
for
understanding
ict
development
and
are
indicative
of
the
deliberate
design
of
ict
interventions
computer
game
programming
has
been
touted
as
a
promising
strategy
for
engaging
children
in
the
kinds
of
thinking
that
will
prepare
them
to
be
producers
not
just
users
of
technology
but
little
is
known
about
what
they
learn
when
programming
a

in
this
article
we
present
a
strategy
for
coding
student
games
and
summarize
the
results
of
an
analysis
of
108
games
created
by
middle
school
girls
using
stagecast
creator
in
an
after

class
the
findings
show
that
students
engaged
in
moderate
levels
of
complex
programming
activity
created
games
with
moderate
levels
of
usability
and
that
the
games
were
characterized
by
low
levels
of
code
organization
and
documentation
these
results
provide
evidence
that

involving
both

has
experienced
a

fashionable

suggestive
the
concept

even
though
gender
equality
is
an
important

there
are

is
overwhelming
we

studies
in

and
computer

in
particular
where
there
is
only
16
of

this
fact
made
us
think
about
the
reason
for
this
inequality
we
attempted
to
answer
such
questions
by
means
of
a
survey
filled
out
by
138
students
of
stem

degrees
thanks

this
survey
we
have

our

differences
between

enhancement

success
in
stem-related

has
acquired
an
unprecedented
level
of
traction
in

increased
participation
in

as
a
moral

hots
is
essential
for
21st-century
students
to
effectively
address
complex
challenges
assessing
hots
can
increase
students’
awareness
of
their
cognitive
abilities
and
promote
the
development
of
advanced
cognitive
skills
this
study
proposes
an
automated
assessment
approach
for
hots
to
overcome
the
limitations
of
existing
methods
that
rely
on
experts
and
are
often
short-term
the
exceptional
knowledge
base
and
advanced

llms
have
prompted
academics
to
extend
their
application
to
various
areas
where
they
outperform

limited
to
specific
domains
inspired
by
this
we
propose
a
framework
for
the
automated
assessment
of
hots
using
llms
called
llm4ha
the
framework
consists
of
two
distinct
models
a

constructed
from
pre-trained
bert
and
a
student
hots
assessment
model
based
on
response
data
constructed
by
fine-tuning
pre-trained
llms
to
validate
the
performance
of
our
framework
we
established
a
classification
rule
based
on
bloom’s
taxonomy
for
exercise
classification
we
collected
43070
exercise
data
points
from
181
undergraduate
students
from
which
exercise
text
data
and
response
data
were
obtained
the
results
demonstrate
that
llm4ha
successfully
classifies
exercises
and
assesses
students’
hots
the
bert-based
classification
model
outperforms
chatgpt-4
and
the
llms-based
fine-tuning
model
significantly
outperforms
the
rnns-based
model
a
comprehensive
analysis
was
conducted
to
identify
the
causes
of
this
outcome
the
findings
indicate
that
the
robust
knowledge

may
be
crucial
for
achieving
optimal

this
paper
reports
on
some
preliminary
findings
from
a
research
project
where
two
elementary
teachers
in
an
urban
new

school
introduced
scratch
to
nine
and
ten
year
old
children
in
their
classrooms
in
each
of
the
classrooms
a
small
number
of
computers
and
an
interactive

were
utilised
this
paper
uses
a
case

approach
to
describe
how
engagement
with
scratch
and
independent
use
of
the
iwb
enabled
children
to
work
collaboratively
to
solve
design
challenges
initial
results
indicate
that
the
scratch
program
is
engaging
for
children
it
created
an
environment
where
the
children
were
by
necessity
using
problem-solving
processes
such
as
goal
setting
and
generating
and
testing
of
ideas
the
interactive

afforded
rich
opportunities
for
children
to
collaborate
and
share
their
thinking
some
questions
and
implications
for
the
learning
and
teaching
of
elementary_school

are
explored
at
the
conclusion
of
the
paper
programming
education
has
become
essential
in

yet
students
perceptions
vary
significantly
across

little
is
known
about
how
it
influences

this
study
examined
the
interrelationships
among
perceived

students
attitudes
and
flow
experience
in
programming
learning
across
different
achievement
levels
data
were
collected
through

achievement
levels
above-average
average
and
below-average
a
multi-group

analysis
was
conducted
to
examine
the
relationships
between
variables
the
above-average
group
showed
significantly
more
positive

across
all
variables
than
other
groups
students’
attitudes
mediated
the
relationship
between
perceived

differently
across
achievement
groups
the
findings
highlight
the
importance
of
differentiated
teacher
support
strategies
across
achievement
tiers
and
suggest
that
fostering
positive
attitudes
towards
programming
is
crucial
for
all
achievement
levels
particularly
through
enhancing
the
perceived

findings
from
both
studies
revealed
that
students
experienced
a
decrease
in
endogenous
pi
and
career
aspirations
and
an
increase
in
exogenous
pi
during
the

study
1
showed
that
non-computer
science
majors
experienced
greater
shifts
in
pi
and

showed
that
the

and
was
curvilinear
with
more

happening
in
the
first
half
of
the
semester
than
the
second
half
both
studies
also
showed
that
computer-science-related

were
associated
with
pi
and
that
aspirations
and
pi
had
a
stronger
relationship
with

this
article
addresses
the
opportunities

of
turning

stem
classroom
into
a
makerspace
for
hands-on

in
this
qualitative
case
study
over
a
period
of
16
weeks
video
data
were
collected
during
making
activities
in
an
advanced
placement
science
course
with
19
pupils
aged
12–16
years
and
interviews
were
conducted
we
combined
thematic
and

analyses
of

data
and
identified
three
themes
1
engagement
and
spontaneous

2
programming
and

and
3
subject
integration
our
conceptual
framework
for
the
analyses
integrated
two
features
of
the
vygotskian
sociocultural
theory
of
learning
concept
development
as
a
dialectical
process
of
scientific
and
everyday
concepts
and
the
“tool
and
symbol”
duality
our
findings
show
that
both
top-down
and
bottom-up
approaches
to
integrating
school
subjects
into
a
makerspace
were
effective
but
underused
we
illustrate
this
by
mapping
pupils
shared
understanding
in
a
sociotechnical
space
visualized
as
a
process
of
“rising
to
the
concrete”
which
may
require
teachers
scaffolding
at
different
levels
of
abstraction
and
use
of
instructional
materials
in
different
modalities
the
paper
considers
methods
to
organize
a
network
of
links
to
parameterized
data
objects
a
data
object
is
an
object
identified
by
standard
methods
including
the
network
identifiers
uri
url
and
urn
the
data
objects
can
be
either
atomic
or
have
a
complex
structure
including
links
to
other
objects
and
this
ensures
the
linking
of
objects
into
a
network
which
can
be
considered
as
an
information
graph
it
turns
out
to
be
possible
to
formulate
a
number
of
criteria
for
supporting
the
integrity
of
such
a
structure
the
paper
proposes
language
tools
to
formulate
such
criteria
an
essential
feature
of
this
network
is
the
dependence
of
the
objects’
information
content
on
a
number
of
parameters
first
of
all
on
time
depending
on
the
parameter
the
information
content
of
the
object
can
change
both
with
the
preservation
of
the
integrity
of
the
structure
and
with
its
damage
the
paper
considers
methods
for
a
parameterized
description
of
objects
while
maintaining
integrity
based
on
the
formalism
of
category
theory
the
formalization
used
allows
defining
two
relations
between
objects
and
their
names
identifiers
access
and
links
the
paper
studies
the
basic
properties
of
such
relations
and
reveals
the
differences
between
them
category
theoretical
means
of
describing
objects
require
appropriate
support
tools
for
practical
application
the
paper
proposes
a
configuration
of
support
tools
for
a
network
of
links
to
parameterized
data
objects
based
on
a
combination
of
conceptual
modeling
tools
and
applicative
computing
tools
the
proposed
tools
provide
basic
methods
of
access
to
the
network
of
information
graphs
an
essential
feature
of
the
proposed
tools
is
the
ability
to
determine
the
subjective
way
of
considering
the
information
graph
based
on
the
category
of
correlations
as
well
as
harmonizing
an
objective
and
subjective
way
of

the
proposed

tested
in

deep

methods
and

assist
geologists
in
predicting

hence
lowering

this
allows
accurate
data
analysis
and
completion
of
scientific
research
on
data
obtained
at
geologically
different
places
this
study
used
4
lithologies
datasets
with
high
dimensionality
and
multiclass
imbalance
problems
for
analysis
and
classification
the
imbalance
of
data
classification
is
one
of
the
most
important
problems
facing
current
data
analysis
data
imbalance
can
considerably
influence
classification
performance
especially
when
dealing
with
other
difficulty
variables
such
as
the
presence
of
overlapping
class
distributions
this
impact
is
especially
obvious
in
multi-class
conditions
when
mutual
imbalance
relations
across
classes
complicate
matters
even
further
moreover
the
problem
of
high
dimensionality
can
lead
to
increased
computing
complexity
and
overfitting
and
thus
these
issues
can
affect
classification
performance
to
overcome
these
problems
we
developed
a
new
hybrid
deep
learning
multi-class
imbalanced
learning
method
that
combines
synthetic
minority
oversampling
smote
to
resample
the
data
and
recursive

elimination
rfe
to
identify
the
most
useful
predictive
features
finally
we
believe
that
our
developments
can
help
improve

by
providing
accurate

are
seen
as
central
dimensions
of

however
programming
concepts

we
developed

specifically
we
adopted
a

that
allows

revealed
that
the
ar-based

although
it
did
produce
better

achievements
compared
to
the
traditional

is
vital
for

this

highlights
the
necessity
of
embracing

given
the
current
understanding
of

with
key
stakeholders

ertmer’s

the
findings
showed
that
both
first-order

existed
although
they
varied
between
the
cases
it
was
also
found
that
the
barriers
did
not
hinder

but
appeared
to
be

the
findings
suggest
that
schools
use
differentiated
strategies
to
tackle

according

moreover
there
is
a

that
even
in

the

is
crucial

are
easy

however
children
in

might
be
unaware
of
potential
negative
consequences

to
gain
a
deeper

we
conducted

the
emphasis
was
on

as
both
aspects
are
important
for
a
sophisticated
usage
but
vary
in
how
they
are
experienced
or
understood
the
qualitative
data
demonstrated
that
children
draw
observable
inferences
from
vas’
behavior
which
explains
why
children
know
more
about
how
data
is
processed
than
about
how
it
is
stored
or
accessed
our
results
indicate
that
parental
interventions
positively
affect
children’s
understanding
of
data
processing
but
that
this
cannot
be
transferred
to
data
storage
indicating
the
need
for
self-explaining
systems
lastly
knowledge
about
how

is
stored
negatively
predicts
the
willingness

aims
to
address
inefficiencies
and
errors
in
current
manual
rebar

within
the
architecture
engineering
and

aec
industry
which
contribute
to
significant
rebar

method
further
exacerbates
these
issues
by
hindering
effective
stakeholder
collaboration
by

have
shown
potential
for
enhanced
coordination
and
waste
reduction
yet
the
continued
reliance
on
manual
rebar

highlights
a
pressing
need
for
intelligent
automation
this
study
presents
a
novel
bim-based
algorithm
that
leverages

to
streamline
the
optimization
and

key
findings
indicate
that
this
approach
significantly
reduces

honey
bee
foraging
is
a
complex
behavior
because
it
involves
tens
of
thousands
of
organisms
making
decisions
about
where
to
collect
pollen
and
nectar
based
on
the
quality
of
resources
and
the
distance
to
flowers
studying
this
aspect
of
their
biology
is
possible
through
direct
observations
but
the
large
number
of
individuals
involved
in
this
behavior
makes
the
implementation
of
technologies
ideal
to
scale
up
this
type
of
study
consequently
there
is
a
need
for
instruments
that
can
facilitate
accurate
assessments
of
honey
bee
foraging
at
the
colony
level
to
address
this
need
this
work
aimed
to
develop
an
automated
imaging
system
for
monitoring
the
in-and-out
activity
of
honey
bee
foragers
as
they
walk
through
a
customized
entrance
with
a
camera
sensor
at
the
hive
entrance
we
used
apriltags
attached
to
each
bee’s
thorax
to
provide
unique
identification
numbers
that
allowed
the
system
to
track
in-and-out
events
throughout
the
foraging
season
of
the
colony
our
design
relies
on
low-cost
raspberry
pi
computers
and
cameras
along
with
commercially
off-the-shelf
components
making
it
easily
reproducible
with
the
open-source
documentation
provided
we
successfully
deployed
and
evaluated
our
system
in
six
locations
demonstrating
consistent
results
in
this
paper
we
present
the
details
about
the
development
of
the
system
data
collected
from
multiple
colonies
and
post-processing

from
one
of
our

our
results
highlight
the
system’s
effectiveness
in
monitoring
honey

capturing
various
behaviors

with
their

outside
the

which
lay
the
groundwork
for

novice
programmers
struggle
to
comprehend
specific
programming
constructs
such
as
arrays
recursion
and
loops
one
way
to
address
this
challenge
is
to
provide
practice
problems
for
students
in
these
topics
that
are
considered
difficult
to
comprehend
—
such
as
nested
loops
it
is
proven
that
practice
aids
program
comprehension
hence
since
it
is
time
consuming
to
manually
create
many
practice
problems
synthesising
these
problems
is
an
expert
artificial
intelligence
task
that
is
worth
investigating
in
this
paper
we
present
the
synthesis
of
nested
loop
exercises
in
python
for
practice
using
a
context-free
grammar
we
defined
the
grammar
rules
for
modeling
program
templates
algorithms
were
designed
and
implemented
for
the
generation
of
structurally
different
nested
loop
exercises
based
on
the
defined
production
rules
of
the
context-free
grammar
each
program
generated
consists
of
two
or
more
looping
statements
with
a
nesting
and
the
context-free
grammar
rules
also
allow
for
the
spawning
of
infinitely
many
sub-loops
for
every
loop
we
checked
for
the
correctness
of
the
synthesised
nested
loop
programs
with
an
experimental
procedure
of
iteratively
supplying
these
programs
to
the
python
interpreter
the
first
120000
iterations
returned
no
syntactic
bugs
hence
showing
that
these
programs
do
compile
and
have
outputs
furthermore
an
evaluation
of
the
programs
was
carried
out
in
a
survey
with
210
participants
novice
and
expert
programmers
the
results
of
the
evaluation
show
that
over
82
of
the
participants
agreed
that
the
synthesised
exercises
were
correctly
generated
solvable
and
can
be
used
as
practice
exercises
for
novice
programmers
in
introductory
programming

explores
how

epistemic
practices
of

can
be
supported
the
particular
focus
will
be
on
argumentation
in

as
an
epistemic

following
a
review
of
the

including
examples
of

modeling
and
explanations
we
focus
on
teachers
learning
of
argumentation
an
important
element
of
teachers
understanding
of
argumentation
in
science
as
an
epistemic
practice
involves
how
they
might
potentially
distinguish
it
from
argumentation
in
other
subject
domains

generates
enormous

modern
medicine
is
turning
into
a
data
science
the
problem
is
that
most
of
these
data
are
in
arbitrarily
high
dimensions
making
manual
analysis
difficult
yet
impossible
for
humans
this
requires
automated
methods
of
data
science
which
is
what
machine
learning
provides
automatic
machine
learning
methods
show
impressive
results
in
dealing
with
big
data
because
such
algorithms
can
learn
from
training

to
gain

from

thus
helping
to
make

and
predictions
the
more

the
better
these
algorithms
perform
unfortunately
in
medicine
we
are
often
confronted
with
a
small
number
of
data
sets
“little
data”
rare
events
and
complex
data
where
automatic
approaches
suffer
from
insufficient
training
sets
this
calls
for
interactive
machine
learning
with
a
doctor
in
the
loop
who
can
be
beneficial
in
solving
computationally
hard
problems
where
human
expertise
can
help
to
reduce
an
exponential
search
space
through
heuristic
selection
of
data
samples
therefore
what
would
otherwise
be
an
np-hard
problem
reduces
greatly
in
complexity
through
the
input
and
the
assistance
of
a
medical
professional
involved
in
the
machine
learning
pipeline
for
decades
computing
speeds
seemingly
doubled
every
24
months
by
increasing
the
processor
clock
speed
thus
giving
software
a
“free
ride”
to
better
performance
this
free
ride
however
effectively
ended
by
the
mid-2000s
with
clock
speeds
having
plateaued
and
computational
horsepower
instead
increasing
due
to
increasing
the
number
of
cores
per
processor
the
vision
for
parallel
computing
which
started
more
than
40
years
ago
is
a
revolution
that
has
now
ubiquitously
arrived
in
addition
to
traditional
supercomputing
clusters
parallel
computing
with
multiple
cores
can
be
found
in
desktops
laptops
and
even
mobile
smartphones
this
ubiquitous
parallelism
in
hardware
presents
a
major
challenge
the
difficulty
in
easily
extracting
parallel
performance
via
current
software
abstractions
consequently
this
paper
presents
an
approach
that
reduces
the
learning
curve
to
parallel
programming
by
introducing
such
concepts
into
a
visual
but
currently
sequential
programming
language
called
snap
which
was
inspired
by
mit’s
scratch
project
furthermore
our
proposed
visual
abstractions
can
automatically
generate
parallel
code
for
the
end
user
to
run
in
parallel
on
a
variety
of
platforms
from
personal
computing
devices
to
supercomputers
ultimately
this
work
seeks
to
increase
parallel
programming
literacy
so
that
users
whether
novice
or
experienced
may
leverage
a
world
of
ubiquitous
parallelism
to
enhance
productivity
in
all
walks

autism

asd
is
a
neurodevelopmental
disability
that
exhibits

in
vocal
development
restricted

this
syndrome
has
gained
a

of
attention
due

its
prevalence
among
children
across
all
countries
and
from
different
economic
backgrounds
however
asd
detection
and
treatment
yet
remains
in
its
infancy
due
to
the
lack

among

limited
screening
of
proper
developmental
milestones
and
a
dearth
of
diagnostic
tools
to
classify
this
syndrome
with
convincing
accuracy
recent

report
that

biomarkers
for
early
detection
have
made
little
progress
in

this
phenomenon
has
been
exacerbated
since
the
release
of
chatgpt
in
2022
which
has
permanently
transformed
various
educational
activities
and
sparked
widespread
scientific
interest
research
suggests
that
chatgpt
can
help
students
navigate

however
only
a

to
the
use
of

with
the
purpose
of

reveal
that
more

creating
a
need
to

our
understanding
of
how

we
extend
prior

we
asked
32

assign
colour
properties
hue
and
brightness
and
emotional
categories
pleasure
arousal
and
dominance
to
stimuli
of
varying

frequency
we
found
that
perceptions
of
pleasure
and
arousal
increased
with
amplitude
and
angular
frequency
but
negative
and
relaxing
emotional
states
were
not
able
to
convey
we
also
found
associations
between
vibrotactile
stimuli
and
colour
properties
high
amplitude
stimuli
were
linked
to
warm
colours
and
darker
shades
while
low
amplitude
was
associated
with
brighter
shades
and
greater

finish
by
discussing
the
causal

encountered
by
89
us
teachers
in
the
state
of
idaho
participants
were
predominantly
white
female
teachers
serving
in
rural
schools
a
mixed-methods
analysis
of
survey
responses
revealed
that
teachers
were
generally
underprepared
for
integrating
genai
with
fewer
than
half
incorporating
it
into
their
educational
practices
unlike
the
widespread
classroom
integration
patterns
observed
with
general
educational
technologies
teachers
in
this
study
tended
to
use
genai
for
out-of-classroom
duties
ie
lesson
preparation
assessment
and
administrative
tasks
rather
than
for
real-time
teaching
and
learning
these
preferences
could
be
attributed
to
key
barriers
teachers
faced
including
doubts
about
genais
ability
to
manage
risks
ie
technology
value
beliefs
reduced
human
interaction
in

ie
pedagogical

ethical
considerations
and
the
absence
of

this

highlights
the
need
to
develop

to
facilitate

pedagogical

pas
are
increasingly
being
integrated
into
educational
technologies
although
previous
reviews
have
examined
the
impact
of
pas
on
learning
and
learning-related
outcomes
it
still
remains
unclear
what
specific
design
features
social
cues
and
other
contextual
elements
of
pa
implementation
can
optimize
the
learning
process
these
questions
are
even
more
prevalent
with
regards
to
the
k-12
population
as
most
reviews
to
date
have
largely
focused
on
post-secondary
learners
to
address
this
gap
in
the
literature
we
systematically
review
empirical
studies
around
the
design
of
pas
for
k-12
learners
after
reviewing
1374
studies
for
potential
inclusion
we
analyzed
44
studies
that
met
our
inclusion
criteria
using
heidig
and
clarebouts
2011
frameworks
our
findings
showed
that
learners
had
preferences
for
specific
types
of
pas
while
these
preferences
were
not
always
associated
with
increased
learning
outcomes
there
is
a
lack
of
research
specifically
investigating
the
intersection
of
perceptions
and
learning
our
results
also
showed
that
pedagogical
strategies
that
are
effective
for
human
teachers
were
effective
when
used
by
pas
we
highlight
what
specific
design
features
instructional
designers
can
use
to
design
pas
for
k-12
learners
and
discuss
promising
research
directions
based
on
the
extant
work
in
the
field
rural
schools
tend
not
to
have
enough
laboratory
and
experimentation
equipment
which
can
be
an
obstacle
that
hinders
student
learning
in
science
technology
engineering
and
mathematics
stem
areas
moreover
this
loss
of
competencies
can
reduce
their
employment
opportunities
while
society
itself
is
deprived
of
that
human
capital
remote
laboratories
have
emerged
as
a
way
of
countering
the
effects
of
insufficient
investment
in
equipment
or
the
inability
to
acquire
the
latter
by
way
of
example
the
goal
of
project
r3
which
is
presented
in
this
article
is
to
reduce
the
absence
or
shortage
of
laboratories
in
the
rural
world
via
the
use
of
remote
experimentation
specifically
this
article
presents
the
experience
the
results
and
the
main
conclusions
of
project
r3
during
its
first
year
of
life
it
is
worth
noting
that
project
r3
has
been
deployed
not
only
in
rural
but
also
in
urban
environments
making
it
possible
to
compare
learning
results
and
satisfaction
levels
for
students
in
both
spheres
and
identify
those
experiments
that
provide
the
best
learning
experience
and
are
most
popular
among
pupils
and
teachers
the
main
objective
is
that
from
the
local
analysis
the
project
has
only
been
conducted
in
spain
it
might
be
possible
to
draw
conclusions
of
a
global
nature
that
might
be
extrapolated
to
other
countries
in
the
european
union
with
similar
socio-demographics
initial
results
are
in
the
direction
of
certifying
that
student
achievement
and
satisfaction
are
higher
in
rural
than
in
urban
environments
this
article
focuses
on
the
methodology
applied
for
the
review
of
european
educational
projects
within
the
framework
of
erasmus
labelled
as
good
practices
and
that
are
related
to
electronic
learning
or
the
use
of
information
and
communication
technologies
ict
in
education
in
addition
some
of
the
projects
that
have
passed
all
the
research
phases
and
have
proven
to
be
sustainable
over
time
are
analyzed
the
projects
presented
represent
different
educational
sectors
and
propose
learning
systems
through
ict
with
the
involvement
of
students
andor
teachers
as
they
are
good
practice
projects
the
article
can
contribute
both
to
the
use
or
transfer
of
the
resources
developed
in
these
projects
and
to
be
able
to
inspire
new
projects
in
those
lines
of
work
the
main
factors
that
have
contributed
to
the
success
of
the
projects
are
their
usefulness
for
the
educational
community
beyond
the
time
of
funding
the
use
of
innovative
methodologies
applied
with
teachers
and
students
establishing
them
in
the
participating
institutions
another
notable
fact
is
the
good
collaboration
and
rapport
between
all
the
project
partners
who
worked
to
get
common
objectives
the
paper
considers
the
possibility
of
constructing
a
specialized
computing
system
oriented
at
the
transmission
of
data
through
information
channels
that
are
determined
taking
into
account
the
semantics
of
the
selected
data
in
the
process
of
computations
the
data
is
connected
with
semantic
characteristics
that
describe
the
channel
of
computations
which
can
be
considered
as
a
method
of
semantic
data
enrichment
the
system
of
information
channels
as
a
whole
can
be
considered
as
an
information
graph
describing
the
structuring
of
the
processed
data
the
information
graph
supports
the
data
model
in
the
form
of
a
network
the
framework
of
which
are
objects
and
the
relationships
between
them
the
paper
proposes
language
tools
for
determining
the
information
graph
and
interpretation
tools
that
provide
practical
computations
the
set
of
information
channels
that
make
up
the
information
graph
can
be
considered
as
a
low-level
tool
for
data
enrichment
the
paper
studies
the
possibility
of
determining
tools
of
higher
level
an
applicative
type
language
is
proposed
for
defining
information
graphs
the
syntax
and
semantics
of
the
language
are
specified
the
proposed
language
can
be
considered
as
an
intermediate
level
tool
for
defining
semantics
a
procedure
is
proposed
for
compiling
the
language
into
a
low-level
construct
preserving
the
semantics
of
the
language
the
supporting
system
for
the
proposed
computing
system
includes
a
low-level
language
interpreter
as
well
as
an
intermediate-level
language
compiler
into
a
low-level
language
the
supporting
system
is
implemented
in
an
applicative
programming
environment
some
elements
of
the
supporting
system
were
tested
when
developing
applied
information
systems
in
the
field
of
jurisprudence
fablearn

a
venue
for
researchers
and

and
making
in

where
reflective
practices
are
an
integral
part
this
paper
presents
a
systematic
literature
review
on
the
use
of
the
term
reflection
in
fablearn
research
with
this
review
we
provide
an
answer
to
the
questions
1
what
reflection
means
in
fablearn
research
2
how
these
reflections
are
stimulated
and
scaffolded
in
practice
ie
teachersfacilitators
and
studentsparticipants
and
3
what
types
of
concerns
or
subject
matters
take
place
in
reflective
practices
the

is
conducted
in
fablearn
us
and
europe
proceedings
between
2014–2019
and
resulted
in
68
papers
included
in
the
analysis
the
findings
show
that
fablearn
research
need
to
develop
solid
theoretical
groundings
and
frameworks
as
guidelines
to
scaffold
students’
reflection
and
more
in-depth

dt
has
drawn
increasing
attention
in
k-12

however
research
on
dt
in
k-12
education
has
not
yet
been
comprehensively
reviewed
the
current
review
research
attempted
to
bridge
this
gap
in
the
field
following
the
prisma
guidelines
this
review
examined
40
empirical
studies
on
dt
in
k-12
education
with
specific
emphasis
on
four
key
aspects
1
research
areas
2

3

and
4
reported

in

in
terms
of
the
first
aspect
the
main
themes
to
analyze
were
identified
as
participant

and
design
mechanism
in
terms
of
the
second
aspect
it
was
found
that

were
conducted
primarily
in
the
context
of

technology
engineering
and
mathematics
education
in
middle

and
durations
ranging
from
three
days
to
nine
weeks
in
terms
of
the
third
aspect
these
studies
typically
carried
out
qualitative
analysis
of
documents
and
administered
questionnaires
interviews
and
observations
the
articles
described
the
development
of
questionnaires
online
games
and
scales
to
evaluate
dt
in
terms
of
the
fourth
aspect
the
findings
showed
that
dt
was
welcomed
by
most
participants
and
it
was
capable
of
optimizing
learning
processes
and
helped
promote
student
learning
dt
can
be
developed
not
only
through
dt
courses
but
also
through
programming

the
effective
way
to
dt
was
explained
through
time
allocation
modalities
and
iteration
sequence
exploration
based
on
the
findings
it
may
be
concluded
that
dt
is
still
in
an
early
development
stage
in
k-12
education
and
so
research
on
dt
has
not
yet
been
broadly
established

the
need
for
car
wash
services
nowadays
is
increasing
since
most
car
owners
are
too
busy
to
wash
their
automobiles
themselves
nowadays
car
wash
facilities
give
numerous
car
wash
or
car

services
such
as
foam
washing
waxing
and
polishing
which
are
handy
for
consumers
however
there
are
certain
limits
revealed
that
customers
must
queue
up
for
a
long
period
till
their
turn
during
busy
hours
clients
could
have
to
wait
for
a
few
hours
which
wastes
customers’
time
besides
it
is
problematic
for
people
living
in
apartments
because
there
is
no
place
for
them
to
wash
their

other
than
that
most

there
has
been
a

however
there

in
two
real
online

in
a

the

suggested
that

moreover
student

were
discussed
how

understood
has
a

if
critical_thinking

seen
as
a
complex
mix
of
knowledge
skills
and
dispositions
that
can
be
articulated
and
made

then
there
is

if
however
critical_thinking

seen
as
a
general

more
or

impermeable
to

influence
and
best
realised
through
the
development
of

then
an
explicit
focus
on

can
enhance
human
welfare
in
numerous
respects
such
as
through
improving
the

of
food
health
water
education
and
energy
services
however
the
misuse
of

due
to
algorithm
bias
and
a
lack
of

could
inhibit
human

and
result
in
employment
gender
and
racial

we
envision
that
ai
can
evolve
into
human-centered
ai
hai
which
refers
to
approaching
ai
from
a
human
perspective
by
considering
human
conditions
and
contexts
most
current
discussions
on
ai
technology
focus
on
how
ai
can
enable
human
performance
however
we
explore
ai
can
also
inhibit
the

and
advocate
for
an
in-depth
dialog
between
technology-

humanity-based
researchers
to
improve

the
significance
of

is
quite
evident
in

thus
the
awareness
of
how
to
teach

been
sharply
questioned—perhaps
being
overhyped
given

children
regarding
the

we
then
highlight
the

tcps
is
a
major
area
of
growth
and
investment
in
many
countries
but
there
is
a
significant
shortage
of
engineers
with
the
correct
skills
to
build
safe
secure
and
efficient
tcps
it
is
suggested
that
a
much
broader
education
is
required
in
cyber-physical
system
cps
than
has
traditionally
been
the
case
for
degree
and
masters
level
students
cps
developers
will
need
to
be
knowledgeable
about
natural
applied
and
social
sciences
the
curriculum
for
a
tcps
engineer
emerges
as
a
vast
range
of
knowledge
requirements
and
it
is
suggested
that
ideally
students
will
graduate
with
a
t-shaped
curriculum
vitae
that
provides
for
a
broad
knowledge
of
many
subjects
and
a
deep
knowledge
in
one
or
two
studies
into
the
appropriate
curriculum
for

have
been
conducted
since
the
early
2000s
but
it
is
noted
that
many
of
these
failed
to
give
adequate
weight
to
ethics
and
topics
in
the
social
sciences
a
framework
for
tcps
graduate
and
postgraduate
education
is
provided
delivery
of
the

must
ensure
students
are
taught
in
a
transdisciplinary
manner
and
develop
an
holistic
approach

modern
society
is
increasingly
mediated
by
computers
the
quantity
and
diversity
of
data
generated
daily
is
growing
at
an
astounding
rate
while
the
number
of
people
with

ability
is
also
growing
the
percentage
of
the
population
with
such
capability
remains
in
the
single
digits
this
means
that
we
are
witnessing
a
growing
gap
between
need
and
capacity
some
of
the
need
can
be
met
by
packages
and
apps
that
provide
canned
or
predefined
analysis
but
these
restrict
analyses
to
those
anticipated
by
the
creators
of
those
packages
and
apps
it
is
essential
that
in
a
data
society
nearly
all
citizens
have
a
capacity
to
program
therefore
it
is
critical
that
we
find
“programatic”

has
generated
excitement

concern
in

while
cross-sectional

have
highlighted
correlations
between

they
fall
short
of
establishing
causality
this
review
examines
experimental

impact
on

to
address
this
gap
a
comprehensive

reveal
that

predominantly
implemented
at
the
university
level
cover
various
subject
areas
focusing
on

education
are
integrated
into

overall
chatgpt
improves

propensities
it
reduces

and
has
no
significant

however
methodological
limitations
such
as
the
lack
of
power
analysis
and
concerns
regarding
post-intervention

warrant
cautious
interpretation
of

this
review
presents
four
propositions
from
the
findings
1
distinguish
between
the
quality
of
chatgpt
outputs
and
the
positive
effects
of
interventions
on
academic
performance
by
shifting
from
well-defined
problems
in
post-intervention
assessments
to
more
complex
project-based
assessments
that
require
skill
demonstration
adopting
proctored
assessments
or
incorporating
metrics
such
as
originality
alongside
quality
2
evaluate
long-term
impacts
to
determine
whether
the
positive
effects
on
affective-motivational
states
are
sustained
or
merely
owing
to
novelty
effect
3
prioritise
objective
measures
to
complement
subjective
assessments
of
higher-order
thinking
and
4
use
power
analysis
to
determine
adequate
sample
sizes
to
avoid
type
ii
errors
and
provide
reliable
effect
size
estimates
this
review
provides
valuable
insights
for
researchers

evaluating
the
effectiveness
of

it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that
design

rt
skills
are
among
the
qualities
that
must
be
possessed
by
every

one
of
the
most
important
pillars
in
achieving
the
goals
of
curriculums
in
the
world
of

where
digital

has
become
a
great
power
this
makes
it
necessary
to
carry
out
studies
to
develop
teacher
training
programs
in
this
direction
the
purpose
of
the
current
study
is
to
determine
the
effect
of

on
the

of
pre-service

and
to
elicit
the
opinions
of

implications
about

are
other
frequently

themes
to
sum
up
this

makes
several
recommendations
for
aire
research
for
educators

and
policy
makers
in
higher_education
settings
as
a
reference
based
on
the
results
number
sense
can
be
described
as
good
intuition
about
numbers
and
their
relationships
individuals
with
good
number
sense
tend
to
exhibit
the
following
characteristics
when
performing
mental
computations
sense-making
approach
planning
and
control
flexibility
and
appropriateness
sense
of
reasonableness
this
is
a
very
important
skill
to
be
mastered
by
every
individual
to
enable
them
to
handle
numerical
problems
in
their
daily
life
students
rarely
face
problems
with
algorithms
unfortunately
many
studies
have
showed
that
students
have
poor
understanding
in
making
sense
on
numbers
when
tested
on
their
competency
in
number
sense
component
this
study
aims
to
investigate
if
there
is
a
relationship
between
student
performance
in
number
sense
and
mathematics
achievement
and
to
explore
the
components
of
number
sense
that

are
weak
in
brain
development
is
underpinned
by
complex
interactions
between
neural
assemblies
driving
structural
and
functional
change
this
neuroconstructivism
the
notion
that
neural
functions
are
shaped
by
these
interactions
is
core
to
some
developmental
theories
however
due
to
their
complexity
understanding
underlying
developmental
mechanisms
is
challenging
elsewhere
in
neurobiology
a
computational
revolution
has
shown
that
mathematical
models
of
hidden
biological
mechanisms
can
bridge
observations
with
theory
building
can
we
build
a
similar
computational
framework
yielding
mechanistic
insights
for
brain
development
here
we
outline
the
conceptual
and
technical
challenges
of
addressing
this
theory
gap
and
demonstrate
that
there
is
great
potential
in
specifying
brain
development
as
mathematically
defined
processes
operating
within
physical
constraints
we
provide
examples
alongside
broader
ingredients
needed
as
the
field
explores
computational
explanations
of

the
growing
importance
of

implies
that
adequate

should
be
available
to
all
students
regardless

the

suggesting
that
incorporating

in

it
is
argued
that

is
required
to
underpin
theorizing
about

it
is
claimed
that
the

view
of
the
mind
which
is
the
conventional
way
of
understanding
how

impacts
on

is
deeply
flawed
there
is
an
alternative
interpretation
that
is
more
faithful
to

avoids
the
criticisms
made
of
the

approach
and
is
compatible
with
the

an

a
systematic
literature
review
was
conducted
to
identify
how
dc
has
been
operationalized
in
teaching
practices
to
date
the
findings
reveal
that
dc
is
often
used
as
an
umbrella
term
for
technology-related
learning
tasks
that
nevertheless
fail
to
actively
engage
students
in
practicing
dc
in
a
critical
manner
in
addition
older
students
are
often
asked
to
develop
dc
in
project-based_learning
outside
the
school
setting
while
interdisciplinary
approaches
to
dc
have
been
proposed
disciplines
such
as
philosophy
or
ecology—apparently
necessary
to
work
on

not
considered
finally
digital

methodology
was
applied
in
this

a
semi-structured
interview
was
conducted
to
collect
data
from
five
k-3
female
teachers
who
implemented
online

during
the
pandemic
three
themes
emerged
from
the
findings
1
effects
of
the

as
related
to

of
21st

skills
2

and
3
challenges
that
exist
for

and
student
acquisition
of
21st

skills
therefore
the
findings
suggest
that
elementary

should
find
opportunities
for
elementary
students
to
experience
distance
learning
as
an
ongoing
learning
solution
in
order
to
incorporate
innovative

requires
a
fundamental
change
in

way
we
live

one
another
it
requires
a
new
type
of
intelligence
to
deal
with
this
fundamental
change
this
new
type
of

requires
new
competencies
yet
it
is
not
crystal
clear
what
these
new

should
be
especially
those
relating
to
the
discipline
of

management
project
leaders
are
required
to
implement
and
manage
4ir-related
projects
but
do
not
necessarily
have
the
required
competencies
this
is
especially
the
case
in
a
developing
country
such
as
south

the
study
explored
the
digital
competencies
that
are
deemed
important
by
project
managers
in
managing

in
the
digital

q-methodology
was
used
to
determine
potential
perspectives
and
three
confirming
perspectives
and
one
emergent

were
identified
the
main
competence
deemed
important
is
online
communication
and
collaboration
whereas
cybersecurity
is
deemed
unimportant
this
study
is
the
first
of
its
kind
and
provides
insight
into
the
digital

of
project
leaders
it
contributes
to
the
current
debate
around
the
future
digital

that
are
required
it
also
provides
guidelines
for

a

the
discussion

has
become
a
hot
topic
today
after
the
emergence
of

and
with
its
huge

is
to
provide

major
findings
include
that
the
majority
of
publications
cited
both

and
eu
policy
in
describing
the
definition
of
digital

the
review
indicates
that
most
university
students
and
teachers
have
a
basic
level
of
digital

besides
the
institutions
of

are
encouraged
to
focus
on

in
providing

tools
for

software
design
patterns
are
explored
along
with
reusable

guidelines
these
recommendations
support
programmer’s
thought
processes
and
provide
a
common

through
which
to
communicate
software
organization
four
basic
structures
of

include
function
alternation
repetition
and

these
structures
are
then
presented
in

tools
these
tools
include

in
gamification
personalization
is
considered
an
important
field
of
research
since
it
can
improve
user
engagement
and
motivation
particularly
effective
gamified
learning
needs
to
strike
a
balance
between
gameful
design
that
promotes
engagement
and
does
not
negatively
affect
content
comprehension
and
absorption
the
existing
traditional
user-type
questionnaires
approaches
are
time-consuming
and
intrusive
hampering
the
user’s
focus
previous
research
in
gamification
demonstrated
how
to
automate
player
profile
creation
through
log
file
analysis
of
gameful
systems
instead
of
traditional
approaches
however
psychological
archetypes
and
motivational
groups
can
simplify
the
process
of
collecting
data
to
achieve
a
balanced
level
of
personalization
for
gamified
systems
which
are
grounded
on
the
user’s
profile
and
preferences
which
can
help
with
their
immersion
to
attend
to
the
needs
of
a
wide
range
of
fields
that
introduce
gamification
to
systems
that
are
not
classified
as
games
a
new
ludic
approach
was
created
to
define

interaction
using
symbolic

in
this
exploratory
research
we
tested
this
approach
in
two
card-sorting
studies
n35
and
n19
our
results
show
that
the
images
can
be
used
to
predict
the
users’
archetypes
and
motivational
groups
accurately
thus
we
contribute
with
validating
an
image-based
user
type
classification
method
that
is
easier
to
deploy
in
systems
that
do
not
aim
to
behave
as
a
game
but
are
looking
to
reap
the
benefits
of
personalizing
a
user’s
content
and
gameful
experience
where
relevant
our
second
contribution
is
delivering
guidelines
to
replicate
this
validation
method
to
other
existing
approaches
we
expect
that
with
this
guideline
we
facilitate
personalization
with
other
user
typologies
without
disrupting
the
gameful
experience
this
paper
highlights
the
importance
of
evaluating
educational
technology
for

contexts
we
present
the

the

method
ttm
which
formalizes
a
method
for
idc
researchers
to
use
when
deploying
and
validating
an

our
key
findings
indicate
the
need
to
work
in
partnership
with
classroom
teachers
providing
both
initial
training
and
continued
support
this
will
both
result
in
more
valuable
research

and
address
a
gap
in

the
ttm
aims
to
ensure
that
teachers

can
benefit
from
innovative
educational

deployed
in
real
classroom
contexts
we
believe
that
the
ttm
could
be
adapted
to
other
domains
of

within

community
the
paper
goes
on
to
argue
the
more
general
point
that
the
interaction
design
and
children
community
should
shift
emphasis
away
from
technology
innovation
and
towards
reporting
replicable
longitudinal_research
findings
from
real-world
settings
we
discuss
possible
approaches
to
achieving
this
for
example
through
changes
to

by

although

china’s
higher

is
in
urgent
need
of
cultivating
a
group
of
innovative
talents
in
engineering
science
and
technology
in
order
to
improve
the
quality
of
engineering
education
china
proposed
the
“new
engineering
research
and
practice
project”
in
june
2017
this
study
attempted
to
adopt
systematic
review
based
on
207
projects
of
engineering
superior
universities
in
china’s
new
engineering
research
and
practice
project
for

and
discovered
the
common
key
issues
such
as
mechanism
issues
ability
issues
and
discipline
issues
that
are
concerned
in
existing
projects
the
research
findings
are
as
follows
1
the
commonness
of
construction
schemes
is
emerging
in
terms
of
mechanism
construction
the
mechanism
of
collaborative
education
receives
the
most
attention
while
the
talent
ability
pays
more
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
soft
ability
2
the
overall
design
of
the
projects
are
somewhat
lacking
innovation
and
features
and
certain
construction
schemes
are
similar
failing
to
effectively
combine
the
advantages
of
universities
and
disciplines
to
serve
local
industries
and
truly
show
its
characteristics
3
most
of
the
construction
plans
are
aimed
at
the
transformation
of
traditional
disciplines
and
there
is
little
construction
of
corresponding
disciplines
for
certain
national
key
industries
makerspaces
are
used
to
promote

used
a
curriculum

to
integrate
the

into
chinese
kindergartens
we
used
a
quasi-experimental

to
evaluate
the
effects
of
this
curriculum
intervention
with
120
children
enrolled
in
the
experimental

while
the

111
children
enrolled
in
the

showed
that
the

resulted
in
significantly
higher

in
the
intervention
group
relative
to
the

analyses
of
parent-report
child
behaviors
revealed
that
there
was
a
significant
effect
of
the
mm

on
post-intervention
temperamental
surgency
our
evidence
shows
that
such
a
scalable

encourages
and
guides
teachers
to
build
a
positive
learning
environment
for
supporting
young
childrens
making
and
thinking
in
everyday
preschool
experiences
the
makerspace
further
sets
a
solid
foundation
for
the
development
of
childrens
stem
thinking
skills
and
socioemotional
skills
in
a
rapidly
changing
digital
society
there
exists
literary
evidence
that
there
is
an
established
relationship
between
humanizing
bots
and
customer
perceptions
of
fairness
and
consequential
user
experience
this
study
seeks
to
evaluate
factors
that
impact
the
perception
surrounding
the
fairness
of
social
bots
and
the
impact
of
these
factors
on
user
experience
a
qualitative
approach
was
used
to
examine
the
fairness
factors
related
to
social
bots
and
their
impact
on
user
experience
with
the
help
of
data
collected
from
32
professionals
with
diverse
backgrounds
the
results
obtained
from
manual
coding
and
nvivo
were
assessed
to
evaluate
the
convergence
of
themes
for
the
confluence
of
results
and
establish
thematic
validity
the
findings
revealed
two
major
themes
namely
artificial
intelligence
ai
technology
governance
and
ai
technology
outcome
this
research
furthers

and
provides
a
theoretical
framework
delineating
antecedents
ai
technology
governance
and
ai
technology
outcomes
of
positive
user

while
deploying
ai-based
social
bots
not
many
efforts
have
been
made
so
far
to
understand
the
effects
of
both
the
2015–2016
drought
and
the
2020
lockdown
measures
on
the
agricultural
production
of
smallholder
vis-a-vis
commercial
farmers
in
kwazulu-natal
google
earth
engine
and
random
forest
algorithm
are
used
to
generate
a
dataset
that
help
to
investigate
this
question
a
regression
is
performed
on
double
differenced
data
to
investigate
the
effects
of
interest
a
k-mean
cluster
analysis
is
also
used
to
determine
whether
the
distribution
patterns
of
crop
production
changed
with
drought
and
disruption
of
agricultural
production
input
results
show
that
1
droughts
affected
the
agricultural
production
of
both
areas
similarly
crop
cover
declined
in
both
areas
for
one
season
after
droughts
were
broken
then
recovery
was
driven
by
greener
more
productive
crops
rather
than
the
expansion
of
crop
area
2
the
response
of
both
areas
to
the
covid-19
lockdown
was
also
similar
both
smallholder
and
commercial
areas
normalised
difference
vegetation
index
–
a
proxy
for
crop
vitality
–
improved
in
response
to
regulations
favourable
to
the

and
improved
rainfall
no
significant
adjustments
in
crop
cover
were
observed
production
therefore
changed
primarily
at
the
intensive
margin
improved
productivity
of
existing
croplands
rather
than
the
extensive
changing
the
extent
of
land
under
cultivation
3
cluster
analysis
allows
for
a
more
granular
view
showing
that
the
positive
impact
of
lockdowns
on
agriculture
were
concentrated
in
areas
with
high
rainfall
and
close
proximity
to
metropolitan
markets
both
smallholder
and
commercial
farmers
therefore
are
reliant
on
market
access
together
with
favourable
environmental
conditions
for
improved
production
our
work
investigates
how
making
may
be
used
in
the
context
of
scientific
modeling
in
formal
elementary_school
science
classes
this
paper
presents
an
investigation
of
fourth-
and
fifth-grade
students
engaging
in
making
activities
to
create
simulation
concept-process
and
illustrative
models
in
the
science
classroom
based
on
video
analyses
of
the
making-based
class
sessions
a
generalized
process
model
was
developed
for
each
type
of
science
model
in
addition
cross-cutting
themes
were
found
in
making-based
science
modeling
first
there
are
two
loops
that
intersect
and
interact
with
each
other
modeling
for
making
and
modeling
for
science
content
and
they
interrelate
in
various
ways
depending
on
science
model
type
and
second
showcasing
making
products
sharing
with
peers
teachers
or
helpers
is
a
primary
factor
that
determines
students’
overall
engagement
with
science
in
the
activity
we
suggest
that
making-based
science
kit
and
lesson
design
needs
to
support
students
to
showcase
their
making
output
on
top
of
science-related
reflections
and
to
consider
the
balance
between
making
and
science
activity
we
conclude
that
making
has
the
potential
to
support
the
development
of
scientific
model
thinking
in
the
elementary
science
classroom
but
much
further
research
is
needed
in
this
area
many
studies
investigating
inquiry
learning
in
science
domains
have
appeared
over
the
years
throughout
this
period
inquiry
learning
has
been
regularly
criticized
by
scholars
who
favor
direct
instruction
over
inquiry
learning
in
this
vein
zhang
kirschner
cobern
and
sweller
2022
recently
asserted
that
direct
instruction
is
overall
superior
to
inquiry-based
instruction
and
reproached
policy
makers
for
ignoring
this
fact
in
the
current
article
we
reply
to
this
assertion
and
the
premises
on
which
it
is
based
we
review
the
evidence
and
argue
that
a
more
complete
and
correct
interpretation
of
the
literature
demonstrates
that
inquiry-based
instruction
produces
better
overall
results
for
acquiring
conceptual
knowledge
than
does
direct
instruction
we
show
that
this
conclusion
holds
for
controlled
correlational
and
program-based
studies
we
subsequently
argue
that
inquiry-based
and
direct
instruction
each
have
their
specific
virtues
and
disadvantages
and
that
the
effectiveness
of
each
approach
depends
on
moderating
factors
such
as
the
learning
goal
the
domain
involved
and
students
prior
knowledge
and
other
student
characteristics
furthermore
inquiry-based
instruction
is
most
effective
when
supplemented
with
guidance
that
can
be
personalized
based
on
these
moderating
factors
and
can
even
involve
providing
direct
instruction
therefore
we
posit
that
a
combination
of
inquiry
and
direct
instruction
may
often
be
the
best
approach
to
support
student
learning
we
conclude
that
policy
makers
rightfully
advocate
inquiry-based
instruction
particularly
when
students’
investigations
are
supplemented
with
direct
instruction
at
appropriate
junctures
the
aim
of
this
work
is
threefold
firstly
an
empirical
study
was
designed
with
the
aim
of
investigating
the
beliefs
that
high_school
computing
hsc
teachers
hold
about
a
their
motivational
orientation
self-efficacy
and
self-expectations
as
computing
teachers
b
the
nature
of
hsc
and
its
curricula
c
how
their
students
could
be
better
learners
in
computing
and
the
expectations
they
have
of
their
students
and
d
their
own
teaching
approaches
and
the
alternatives
they
propose
for
best
teaching
of
hsc
secondly
an
empirical
study
was
realized
to
investigate
the
same
hsc
teachers
classroom
practices
thirdly
possible
associations
between
the
teachers
beliefs
and
their
teaching
practices
were
investigated
25
hsc
teachers
participated
their
beliefs
being
elicited
through
structured
interviews
while
their
practices
were
investigated
through
non-participant
observation
using
structured
observation
sheets
the
analysis
of
the
data
revealed
that
hsc
teachers
as
a
group
held
various
beliefs
about
the
aforementioned
issues
some
of
these
beliefs
can
‘empower’
teachers
to
realize
constructivist
approaches
while
others
can
‘constrain’
them
to
the
well-known
traditional
behaviorist
practices
the
majority
of
hsc
teachers
expressed
mixed
beliefs
‘empowering’
and
‘constraining’
and
reported
feeling
overwhelmed
with
little
control
over
their
teaching
due
to
contextual
barriers
the
rapid
evolution
of
computing
and
subsequently
their
lack
of
knowledge
about
current
trends
and
didactics
in
this
discipline
as
well
as
the
perceived
students
culture
about
computing
as
playing
games
and
surfing
the
internet
data
analysis
also
shows
that
there
are
synergies
between
hsc
teachers
beliefs
and
practices
in
the
case
of
mixed
beliefs
at
least
one
‘constraining’
belief
is
reflected
in
teachers
real
practices
however
the
descriptions
of
practices
given
by
most
of
those

as

are
utilized
that
contain
a
multitude
of
critical

although
these
offer
major
advantages
they
are
also
exposed
to
new
external
and
frequently
uncontrollable
factors
increasing
their
risk
exposure
and
enhancing
their
vulnerability
therefore
increasing
resilience
during
city

has
become
a
prerequisite
for
its
survival
but
continuous
resilience
improvement
led
by
workforce
will
help
them
to
prosper
according
to
researchers
officers
should
be
able
to
catalogue
and
prioritize
threats
and

but
is
this
only
the
case
discrete

however
how
these

have
not
been
thoroughly
understood
to

officers
by
exploring
current

as
these
are
acknowledged
in

so
a

was
developed

across
various

to
indicate
responsibilities
and
prioritize

that
resilient

should
possess
the

highlighted
significant

related
to
managing
smart
city
risks
and
identified
a

unique
to
officers
in
this
area
emphasizing
the
need
for
targeted
efforts
to
enhance
urban

through
the
initiatives
led
by

this
article
establishes
a
clear
path
for
advancing
smart
city
research
by
highlighting
competencies
that
could
be
integrated
into
educational
curriculums
these
competencies
are
essential
for
training
a
workforce
that
not
only
enhances
disaster

awareness
but
also
equips
cities
to
handle
potential

game
jams
events
for
co-creating
digital
or
non-digital
games
are
connected
to
learning
in
several
ways
learning
is
a
common
motivation
for
participation
and
various
learning
results
have
been
reported
as
their
outcome
the
existing
literature
on
game
jam
learning
consists
mostly
of
descriptive
individual
case
studies
with
very
incohesive
and
varied
research
aims
methods
and
settings
thus
far
there
have
been
no
attempts
to
further
analyze
and
classify
the
reported
results
of
the
previous
studies
this
article
looks
at
existing
research
on
game
jams
and
learning
comparing
the
reported
learning
results
to
the
future-oriented
skills
and

the
data
set
created
utilizing
the
prisma
checklist
consists
of
25
original
articles
published
between
2010
and
2022
the
results
show
that
participation
in
a
game
jam
event
will
likely
increase
interdisciplinary
epistemic
and
procedural
knowledge
furthermore
it
can
increase
disciplinary
knowledge
depending
on
the
theme
and
other
framings
of
the
event
participation
in
a
game
jam
event
will
likely
further
cognitive
and
metacognitive
skills
as
well
as
social
and
emotional
skills
provided
the
jam
event
is
organized
to
create
a
safe
and
inclusive
space
for
learning
participation
in
a
game
jam
will
also
likely
further
diverse
practical
and
physical
skills
but
the
adoption
of
these
skills
varies
depending
on
individuals’
tasks
inside
their
team
ict-related
skills
are
furthered
in
jam
events
concentrating
on
digital
games
and
can
be
supported
when
making
non-digital
games
thus
game
jams
offer
a
well-suited
method
for
learning

failing
to
capture

also
that

is
that
they

and
a
consideration
of
why

education
systems
must
provide

with
the
skills
they
need

succeed
in
the
21st
century
however
many
countries
have
failed
to
incorporate
the
teaching
of
these
skills
within
their

our
study
therefore
looks
to
portray
teachers
understanding
strategies
and
obstacles
in

we
analyzed
the

this
revealed
varying

with
little

understanding
most

failed
to

the

regardless
of

these

we
conclude
that
there
is

no

around

our

the
question
remains
to
what
extent
is
scratch
engaging
especially
for

in
higher_education
this

addressed
this
gap
by
observing
college

we
adopted
a

we
employed
five

rated
the
extent

in
north
central

most
of

analysis
of

showed
a
significant
agreement
in
the

although
the

however
while

however
the
construction
of

entails
distinct
goals
and
forms
of
interaction
from
those
typically
used
in
conventional
programming
which
should
be
considered
in
designing
those
environments
drawing
inspiration
from
taxonomies
within
the
field
of

we
derived
a
framework
for
the
analysis
of
educational

comprising
four
categories
supported

we
situate

it
also
identifies
risks
such
as
exacerbating

and
increasing
environmental

can
offer
transformative
solutions
for

will
be
extensively
used
in
the

field
consequently
it
is
important
to
determine
how
these
robots
can
optimally
interact
with
students
this
paper
specifically
looks
at
the
performance
of
social
robots
in
place
of
university
professors
in
the
field
of
engineering
measuring
three
outcomes
enjoyment
questionnaire
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
academic
test
after
class
and
final
exam
grades
and
level
of
surprise
facial
expressions
monitored
by
cameras
inspired
by
previous
cognitive
studies
which
have
evidenced
that
feelings
of
surprise
and
familiarity
affect
the
learning
process
the
hypothesis
of
this
research
is
that
robot-tutors
will
increase
students
enjoyment
leading
the
research
to
question
whether
higher
levels
of
enjoyment
strongly
correlate
with
a
higher
acquisition
of
knowledge
through
a
series
of
three
experiments
using
the
same
subject
material
three
variables
were
tested
1
one
robot-tutor
lecture
2
one
human-tutor
lecture
3
two
robot-tutor
lectures
initial
findings
showed
that
students
lectured
by
a
human-tutor
once
acquired
a
higher
level
of
knowledge
compared
to
those
lectured
by
a
robot-tutor
once
however
those
in
the
robot-tutor
lecture
shared
higher
levels
of
enjoyment
as
well
as
increased
expressions
of
surprise
when
students
were
lectured
by
a
robot-tutor
for
the
second
time
results
showed
both
a
higher
level
of
acquired
knowledge
and
enjoyment
and
a
drop
in
expressed
surprise
compared
to
both
one
human-tutor
lecture
and
one
robot-tutor
lecture
or
one
robot-tutor
lecture
we
conclude
that
high
levels
of
surprise
distracted
students
initially
but
once
overcome
acted
as
motivation
to
study
the
use

hinges
upon
various
factors
one
of
which
is
the
perspective
of

the
findings
revealed
that
both
stem

expressed
positive
attitudes
toward
the
integration
of

however
notable
differences
in

were
also
identified
in

we
further
propose

using
the

of

this
work
verifies
that
the
complicated
research
and
development
of
perovskite
materials
can
be
simplified
into
a
mathematical
problem_solving
process

will
inspire
researchers

to
participate

mathematicians
and
computer

the
emerging
trend
of
teaching
computer
programming
to
more
and
younger
people
has
led
to
the
development
of
game-based_learning
and
teaching
approaches
in
this
context
educational
games
are
considered
as
a
promising
learning
platform
however
research
in
the
field
of
programming
games
has
mainly
focused
on
what
is
being
taught
in
these
games
less
is
known
however
about
how
programming
games
afford
learning
and
playing
by
design
to
address
this
we
performed
a
qualitative
comparative
analysis
of
19
programming
games
from
an
instructional
and
game
attributes
perspective
the
findings
showed
that
a
majority
of
programming
games
presents
only
a
moderate
alignment
with
established
instructional
principles
furthermore
significant
differences
in
the
presence
and
prevalence
of
their
game
attributes
were
found
our
analysis
resulted
in
a
systematic
classification
of
programming
games
according
to
their
alignment
with
instructional
principles
and
their
positioning
on
a
playing-versus-programming
spectrum
informed
by
this
twofold
classification
we
explored
whether
particular
programming
games
can
still
be
conceptualized
as
games
as
opposed
to
learning
or
programming
environments
accordingly
we
formulated
opportunities
and
restrictions
towards

in

we

therefore
it
is

the
way
we
develop

to

the
challenges
posed
by

our
goal
is
to
contribute
with
a
reusable
sustainability
requirements
catalogue
that
helps
developers
be
aware
of
sustainability-related
properties
worth
considering
during
software
development
the
information
for
this
catalogue
was
gathered
via
a
systematic
mapping
study
whose
results
were
synthesised
in
feature
models
and
then
modelled
using
istar
for
a
more
expressive
and
configurable
representation
a
qualitative
evaluation
of
the
catalogue’s
readability
interest
utility
and
usefulness
by
50
participants
from
the
domain
showed
that
around
79
of
the
respondents
found
the
catalogue
“good”
or
“very
good”
however
more
than
5
of
the
expert
participants
found
weaknesses
regarding
most
of
the
evaluated
questions
and
around
25
are
neutral
in
their
overall
evaluation
this
led
us
to
evolve
the
initial
version
of
the
catalogue
for
the
social
and
technical
dimensions
of
sustainability
to
improve
its
completeness
and
usefulness
this
is
achieved
by
aligning
the
information
gathered
in
the
systematic
mapping
study
with
the
well-established
quality
model
of
the
isoiec
250102011
as
we
expect
most
of
the
experts
are
familiar
with
those
qualities
and
respective
hierarchies
during
this
process
we
found
information
that
led
us
to
propose
two
additional
qualities
that
were
not
covered
by
the
iso
standard
fairness
and
legislation
we
applied
this
evolved
version
of
the
catalogue
to
the
u-bike
project
comparing
the
requirements
elicited
without
the
catalogue
with
those
identified
using
the
catalogue
the
result
suggests
that
new
sustainability
requirements
were
worth
considering
from
a
sustainability
point
of
view
supporting
the
usefulness
of

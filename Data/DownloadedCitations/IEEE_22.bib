  abstract={Cultivating students' innovative ability has been playing an important role in the process of program design courses in Colleges and Universities. This paper focuses on presenting practical experience of the programming and designing patterns in teaching Python programming. Combining MBO (Management By Objective) with teaching, an optimized teaching model of Python Programming based on MBO. The model consists of four parts: Knowledge objectives, Technology ability objectives, Thinking Developed objectives, extended ability objectives. Following the four main goals, this paper introduces relevant teaching practices based on each objective. Applying the model , the quality of planned teaching and learning can be improved. Because setting clear goals could make it easy to formulate plans, tasks, teaching contents, track learning effects and test learning consequences. According to the model, the course teaching practice will highlight the importance of teaching Program concretely and effectively. Most significantly, teachers could train students to gradually develop computational thinking and apply it in subsequent courses.},

  abstract={Building on the success of the first North-South cross-continental collaborative educational robotics mission held in November 2015 [1], this paper presents a practical model for scaling the event up into a program for developing countries, particularly those of Africa, where the first edition took place. Past participants in Remote Rescue Thymio II (R2T2) missions, students and educators alike, have shared qualitative observations about its positive educational impact, notably in the areas of Collaboration, Communication, Critical thinking, Creative problem solving, Computational thinking, and Cross-cultural exchange. The proposed framework for delivering R2T2 missions has been adapted to Africa, being specifically designed to tackle the critical challenges of internet connectivity, teacher training and program costs. In so doing, it strives to pave the way for collaboration with partners in African educational ecosystems and North-South funding bodies that share the vision of making collaborative STEM education more accessible and attractive to teachers and schoolchildren around the world.},

  abstract={Because of its ability to prepare students for the 21st century world of work, educational robotics (RE) has assumed a prominent role in education. Following the methodology provided by Kitchenham, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive overview of studies, research, and practices related to robotics education in higher education. The study focuses on identifying the most commonly used RE hardware-based platforms in academic research publications, the type of knowledge intended to be imparted, and the skills or competencies reinforced by the platforms. Within the findings we can underline that there is no exclusive platform, but rather commercial ones are used, made by the researchers themselves, and even adapted from robots that were not designed for instructional purposes. Moreover, the subjects intended to be taught were all related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and oriented to electrical engineering, electronics, robotics, and computer science professions. On the other hand, the skills that improved the most were computational thinking, cooperation and sophisticated problem solving, which are essential for 21st century job descriptions.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a proposal for a series of STEAM activities developing students’ computational thinking, improving their health literacy, and consequently taking care of their own well-being. The implementation of these activities in the classroom requires not only the knowledge and skills of informatics and biology, but also the collaboration of teachers of both subjects. These activities are implemented in phases, starting in biology lesson and continuing in informatics lesson. The first activity tests the level of sensitivity of people to colour differences. The second activity trains human adaptation to psychological stress. The third activity is focused on creation of compensatory aid that compensates for colour perception disorder. The design and programming of students’ STEAM applications is a meaningful way to use informatics in problem solving. Using and experimenting with these applications helps students to better understand the biological content. STEAM approach strengthens students’ orientation towards interdisciplinary studies (e.g. bioinformatics) at the higher education level and helps them to be more employable in the labour market.},

  abstract={The construction industry is a new avenue for big data and data science with sensors and cyber-physical systems deployed in the field. Construction students need to develop computational thinking skills to help make sense of this data, but existing data science environments designed with textual programming languages create a significant barrier to entry. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octave, an end-user programming environment designed to help non-expert programmers analyze spatiotemporal data (e.g., as gathered by a GPS sensor) in an interactive graphical user interface. To aid exploration and understanding, Octave's design incorporates a high degree of liveness, highlighting the interconnection between data, computation, and visualization. We share the underlying design principles behind Octave and details about the system design and implementation. To evaluate Octave, we conducted a usability study with students studying construction. The results show that non-programmer construction students were able to learn Octave easily and were able to effectively use it to solve domain-specific problems from construction education. The participants appreciated Octave's liveness and felt they could easily connect it to real-life problems in their field. Our work informs the design of future accessible end-user programming environments for data analysis targeting non-experts.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={643-648},
  abstract={There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have "turned-off" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, "all politics are local," and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups.},

  abstract={Problem based learning has been adapted by various universities and inscribed with perspectives based on the demographic challenges. The method known to be effective for producing lifelong learners and improve cognitive skills, has been experimented on several facades. Problems, being major drivers in the process, have been researched to design and the deliberate the most effective ways. Through this paper we propose a game based learning model which can be used as problems in a problem based learning framework. In contrast to learning activities supplied using more old-fashioned didactic methodologies, this strategy can be used to engage a student through meaningful activities. This paper presents a model to use game in problem based learning followed by a case study and its analysis. Giglane game was used in the process to analyze the effectiveness with respect to number of stakeholders and incidents reported. The method is validated for effectiveness and promises to be an effective strategy for reflections and self-directed learning attributes. The method directly supports the decomposition structure from the computational thinking methodology which can be combined with the problem based learning process.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This research paper describes the mathematics teacher knowledge transformation when computer science concepts are integrated with mathematics. During the last decade, schools and educators made a significant effort to introduce Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12. While this effort produced some positive results in schools where resources and specialized educators are available, there are school districts where creating new classes and/or hiring specialized teachers is not a sustainable option. This creates a need for teachers that are specialized in one subject area to expand their knowledge into CS and CT, and teach these concepts in their classes. This knowledge expansion and integration should result in creating integrated curricula using their subject matter knowledge and the newly acquired CS knowledge. This implies that the teacher should be able to identify the intersection of concepts between the two fields, and leverage their difference and similarities to promote deep learning for their students. The current study explores how the teacher candidates' technological, pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in mathematics is affected when mathematical concepts are integrated with CS and CT. This study is a three-day intervention in a graduate level secondary mathematics education methods course, where utilizing Math + CS integrated modules we infuse CS concepts into mathematics. The already known mathematics context reduced the cognitive load for familiarizing the teacher candidates with CS, and the integration of the CS concepts provided a different perspective for thinking about mathematics and teaching. After having the teacher candidates reflecting on the concepts of Variable and Equal Sign (=), our results showed that they started noticing the differences and nuances between the two fields, developing this way their interdisciplinary Math + CS TPACK (I-TPACK) knowledge. Furthermore, the study showed that representing multiplications using repetition structures illuminated the internal mechanic of multiplication and its properties. Finally, the experience with the strict grammar and syntax rules of programming illuminated the areas in the teacher candidates mathematics instruction that were ambiguous in the way they teach variables, equations, percentages, and multiplication.},

  abstract={This research full paper presents a systematic review exploring methods and pedagogical strategies utilized for digitally including adult education students through computer-assisted collaborative activities. Youth and adult education faces significant disparities along the globe, with low enrollment rates in many countries as highlighted in the UNESCO's $5^{th}$ Global Report. Whenever we consider the $4^{th}$ United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal for 2030, education aims for inclusion and lifelong learning opportunities. With the aim of investigating the literature about existing computer-assisted collaborative methods and strategies for digital inclusion of youth and adults, we conduct a systematic literature review on the theme. Findings reveal a scarcity of works tailored to adult education, especially in developing nations, even with the inclusion of Brazilian and South African knowledge repositories to broaden the scope. Collaboration emerges as a prevalent strategy, often alongside other methodologies. Notably, mobile devices are widely utilized due to their accessibility, and social networks and virtual learning environments play significant roles. However, the integration of computational thinking and artificial intelligence for digital inclusion is still in its infancy. Overall, digitally including adult learners is crucial for fostering inclusive education and enhancing opportunities for marginalized populations.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={High schools and undergraduate courses present several problems regarding teaching programming. In this perspective, several factors have led to the development of tools to support programming disciplines, including: (i) the persistent problems in teaching programming worldwide, (ii) the inclusion of computational thinking and programming practices in the new Basic Education Curriculum in Brazil, (iii) the need for a lightweight virtual tool that can be freely shared and used, as many available tools charge fees, and (iv) the practical application of knowledge by licentiate degree students in Computer Science, encompassing both learning theories and software development, through the evaluation of the tool. This research aims to develop and evaluate a lightweight web tool through a case study in the context of supporting feedback for programming activities in Brazilian higher education. Additionally, the study investigates whether the feedback is considered the main problem for first-year students in computer courses from the perspective of licentiate computer science students and whether their participation in the case study can improve their skills and abilities in analyzing educational tools. A total of 16 students and three professors from four disciplines participated in the case study, with an online questionnaire as the main instrument for data collection. The analysis was performed considering the collected responses' quantitative and qualitative aspects. We obtained quantitative responses through a Likert scale, while qualitative aspects were analyzed using the Discourse Unveiling Method (UDUM). Positive aspects were identified for both professors and students, providing initial evidence of the tool's potential. Moreover, the study highlighted important feedback from undergraduate Computer Science students, which provides an opportunity to apply their knowledge technically.},

  abstract={In programming education, the instructor tries to find out the learners who needs help by grasping the learners’ development of understanding using tests that require knowledge. However, in reality, not many learners will acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of current situation implies that programming ability of learners cannot be measured by tests that require knowledge. This paper focuses on not only the knowledge items required for programming but also the programming thinking (computational thinking), which is the ability to combine the constituent elements of the program. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the learner’s understanding from the learner’s process to solve the code puzzles that require programming thinking as well as knowledge. We developed the interface to realize the proposed method. The experimental result with the interface showed that the proposed method could estimate with the accuracy of 80% or more.},

  abstract={The push to develop low-stakes and personally meaningful computer science experiences is creating novel opportunities to broaden participation in CS. These opportunities have become increasingly present across contexts and have expanded the possibilities for introducing and sustaining student participation in computing. However, while these experiences tend to be effective ways for engaging new participants and new forms of participation, we must be careful to not overlook how ’high-stakes’ these experiences might be for learners. To explore this tension, this paper describes two case studies of students engaging in coding and computational thinking with Minecraft Education Edition. The first case study involves a 7-year-old Black and Latina girl who experiences significant frustration when her computer program destroys significant portions of her project. The second is from a Latino boy who avoids using the coding capabilities in Minecraft EDU out of fear that the code might not work properly. Building on these case studies, this paper suggests that the field take steps to ensure that the language and actions associated with low-stakes and high-stakes are reflective of learner perceptions, and that we design learning experiences that appropriately reflect this nuance.},

  abstract={The Coding for Liberal Arts project explores the integration of coding into humanities education to develop both digital and disciplinary skills in primary school learners. The project addresses the need to transcend the traditional approach that confines coding to STEM area, overlooking its potential to enhance critical thinking and cross-disciplinary competencies in the liberal arts. The main objective of this research is to investigate how educational robotic can be used as an interdisciplinary teaching tool in subjects such as Italian, History and Geography, promoting technical skills alongside a critical understanding of academic content. The methodology is based on principles of Media Education, Cooperative Learning, Competence-Based Learning and Experiential Learning, and it follows the phases of the Scientific Method. Preliminary findings suggest that students have acquired basic coding skills and demonstrated the ability to apply them in disciplinary contexts, though further practice is needed for more complex applications. The research underscores computational thinking's transformative potential as a bridge between technical expertise and critical thinking in the humanities, illustrating that its integration into liberal arts not only boosts digital competencies but also supports cognitive development, providing a comprehensive approach to modern education.},

  abstract={Computer Science 1 (CS1) courses introduce undergraduate students to computational thinking and their first programming language. As in most institutions, CS1 is a challenge for students at the University of Brasilia, one of the top 10 universities in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian higher education system changed with an affirmative-action policy to admit more students from the public K-12 system: the “Quota” Law was implemented at all federal public universities. This paper aims to answer two research questions: 1) What knowledge about the positive/negative impact of certain features on the success of a CS1 course can be discovered from mining educational data augmented by social-economic information? 2) Are these features different between quota and non-quota students? The analysis uses social-economic and academic performance data of undergraduate students from 2012 to 2019. Data mining algorithms such as generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, and random forest were applied to the data. The findings include: (1) the relevance of indicators such as the consumption rate of university-subsidized meals, (2) that gender is not a determining factor in failure/success, and (3) a higher failure rate for quota students in the Computer Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering majors.},

  abstract={The teaching of programming is a critical topic in our society. Given the Science and Technology initiatives, these topics are considered in different training cycles: primary, secondary and higher education. In the case of higher education, students must cultivate fundamental concepts for developing computer applications, which contribute to not only the knowledge of programming languages but also open guidelines for computational thinking. In previous research, we evaluated a set of platforms under a usability lens; on this occasion, we compare these results and their impact on the learning outcomes. We evaluated three experimental groups that used video game platforms to achieve their learning outcomes. Additionally, we will synthesize the literature regarding new paradigms of programming education under immersive environments.},

  abstract={This paper explores the evolving landscape of training for archival professionals in the context of big data and emerging technologies. By comparing two educational frameworks—the CAS framework, developed from computational thinking research and CAS research papers, and the InterPARES framework, based on empirical studies with archivists working with AI/ML, we identify areas of alignment and divergence. While both frameworks share significant concordance, suggesting a growing consensus on integrating computing into archival work, key differences in their approaches (learning outcomes vs. competencies) and focus areas (such as work practices, systems thinking, and cybersecurity) highlight the need for further discourse among archival scholars, educators, and practitioners. These distinctions must be addressed before formalizing CAS educational frameworks. This paper also initiates efforts to integrate emerging technological competencies by bridging the CAS and InterPARES frameworks, emphasizing the value of complementary perspectives from both professional practice and academic research. We argue that such integration is essential for developing robust competency frameworks in archival education, particularly within higher education's professional programs.},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly prevalent in various domains, its integration into education offers unique opportunities to enhance learning experiences. This paper explores the application of AI, specifically machine learning, in biology education through the classification of edible and poisonous mushrooms. Leveraging a dataset of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families, this study demonstrates how AI techniques can be used to classify species based on morphological features such as cap shape, gill attachment, and color. The use of AI not only improves students' understanding of species identification and biological classification but also introduces them to key concepts in data science, such as feature selection, model training, and validation. By implementing machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, students can engage in interactive learning experiences that merge biology with modern technological tools. The results show that integrating AI into biology curricula can foster both scientific literacy and computational thinking, offering a more comprehensive and engaging approach to science education. This paper outlines a practical framework for educators to incorporate AI in biology lessons, preparing students for future academic and career challenges in an increasingly digital world.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is contemporary teaching method, applicable within STEM framework, and consists of a series of steps that students – as future engineers – follow, in order to design a prototype artifact and find a solution to a complex engineering problem. These steps usually include problem – solving processes, such as defining the problem, background research, specifying requirements, brainstorming, evaluating, choosing the best solution, developing a prototype, testing the prototype and finally communicating the research results. During the process, students engage themselves with all Computational Thinking (CT) dimensions. In this research, we apply EDP, within the STEM and CT Epistemology framework, in order to design and develop an open – hardware, open – source, low – cost, easy and safe to use, drown, for educational activities, in Higher education. The purpose of this work is to highly engage University students, in developing solutions for complex Mechatronic course - related problems, and evaluate how they achieved their learning objectives. We also design a use case scenario, in which students form proper engineering teams to work with the design of the UAV, to program its behavior and to understand avionics. The simple design, safe use, economic cost, and open philosophy of this drone make it suitable not only for university courses, but also for educational robotics applications, and in STEM education in general, regardless of the educational level.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper describes a novel twofold approach to analyze the data collected during a six-week research-based summer professional development workshop for middle and high school STEM teachers in Southwest Missouri. In the fast-evolving field of Computer Science (CS), particularly within the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, the demand for a skilled workforce is increasing. To meet this demand, it is crucial to provide K-12 students with education in computing, computational thinking, and other broader Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The existing STEM curriculum could be enhanced to develop skills such as research-based problem-solving more effectively, aiming for a more comprehensive skill set among students. Therefore, empowering STEM teachers with a solid foundation of research-based problem-solving skills can significantly boost their readiness for the classroom, thus enriching their students' educational experiences. The Research Opportunity for Smart Environments (ROSE) program, a three-year initiative funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), aims to prepare middle and high school STEM teachers to effectively introduce CS concepts through innovative IoT applications in Smart Environments, including Smart Homes and Smart Classrooms. To support STEM education in rural and other underrepresented areas, a cohort of in-service teachers from rural Southwest Missouri was selected for the inaugural ROSE summer workshop. Our data collection approach included open-ended questions and effective formative assessment techniques to gather the teachers' perspectives during the initial summer session. We adopted a twofold data analysis strategy, using the qualitative coding tool MAXQDA and sentiment analysis tools Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) and TextBlob, to analyze the teachers' responses. The research questions explored the impact of the ROSE program on educators and how their experiences and outlooks influenced their engagement and professional development within the program. The findings indicate that the ROSE program has positively influenced the teachers' personal and professional growth. The teachers experienced increased confidence and knowledge in research and teaching CS concepts, despite facing various challenges, which acted as motivation for learning. Their reflections also indicated that the mentorship and resources provided by the ROSE program have promoted the development of innovative teaching methods and a shift towards a student-centered approach, showcasing the program's success in fostering the personal and professional development of teachers for the advancement of future CS and STEM professionals.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This Innovative Practice of a Full Paper presents new ways of teaching classes. The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline "Algorithms and Data Structures I" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.},

  abstract={STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math-ematics) education is crucial, rising the demand for technological skills driven by the Industry 4.0 digital transformation, and fostering problem-solving, autonomy, computational thinking, creativity, innovation, and effective teamwork skills. To properly address the lack of structured materials in secondary schools, an Educational Design Research (EDR) project was developed to introduce young students to STEM, and particularly to electronics field. For this purpose, the developed approach combines instructionism and constructionism methods, through three educational projects and “Drops of knowledge” modules. The developed material was applied to 9th and 12th grades of a secondary school, with the achieved results showing that this immersive approach effectively provides students with the necessary competencies to tackle the initial technological challenges of electronics. The project was recognized by the Directorate General of Education of Portugal as a recommended practice of a digital initiative within secondary schools.},

  abstract={In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role.},

  abstract={Programming knowledge tracing (programming KT) aims to analyze the dynamic programming states in solving problems based on historical behaviors and predict future performance. In programming, a student’s thought process can lead to multiple solutions for the same problem. However, current programming KT models attribute learners’ responses only to knowledge mastery and ability, overlooking thought factors, which creates a contradiction between data fitting and the rationalization of the model inference process. To address this, we propose a problem solving-oriented programming KT (SPKT) method that incorporates programming knowledge, computational thinking, and solving ability to improve attribution accuracy. Specifically, we designed a dual-channel attention network based on the principle of initiative gain to retrieve knowledge. Additionally, we utilized the edit tree distance algorithm to capture fine-grained trajectory representations and employed a redress mechanism with gating to update abilities based on code information. Experiments demonstrate SPKT’s superiority.},

This research investigates the efficacy of CTProgER through a rigorous intervention study conducted in a Brazilian Technical and Vocational High School (TV High School). The results reveal a significant performance disparity between the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group showing notable improvements. These findings highlight the potential of CTProgER to guide and enhance programming instruction within high school curricula, offering valuable insights for validating educational processes.},

  abstract={Information technologies are the base of the world infrastructure. In this social context, education, like any productive or service sector, is affected by technology. Faced with this reality, educational systems must prepare our young people to live in the digital world, for which they must be proficient in a new language without which they will become digital illiterates. Therefore, in school we should not only train in linguistic and numerical literacy, but also in digital literacy. So far, the effort has been oriented mainly to convert our young people into users of computer tools. This has gone from being necessary to being insufficient, because the use of software applications means to manage a digital language that is obsolete in a time that is not proportional, in effort, to the time that has been invested in acquiring these skills. Therefore, the challenge is to prepare our young people to face the world in which they live, giving them the necessary cognitive tools to succeed in the digital world. That is, instead of teaching students only the syntax of a changing language, they should be instructed in the rules that allow them to know how the digital language is constructed. Thus, computational thinking emerges as a paradigm of work, and the programming is stablished as the tool to solve problems.},

  abstract={End-user programmers have experiences of computation that are different from those of professional software engineers or people trained in computer science. We now understand that these different experiences arise from different motivations, different approaches to the task of programming, and different expectations about the outcomes. This talk reports results from a 10 year programme of research, engaging with collaborators who have been sought out precisely because their motivations, work methods and intentions are as different as possible from typical engineering programmers. These investigations have involved the development of a wide range of novel programmable systems and notations designed for use by choreographers, composers, musicians, and visual artists. The findings extend previous analyses of computational experience such as the attention investment model of abstraction use, and the cognitive dimensions of notations, drawing attention to ways of programming that are not only utilitarian, but playful and engaging. Research of this kind also helps us to understand that there are not necessarily different kinds of people in the world - those who are creative or not - but rather different ways of engaging with technology, available to all designers painting from the palette of human-centric computing systems.},

  abstract={There have been many periods in the unfolding of human history when we have asserted that it was possible to catalog all that was known or that could be known. Ignoring the pragmatic reality of trying to catalog an ever-expanding corpus, one must understand that such a task is further complicated by cultural and situational bias: what is important to know at one place and time is not necessary important in another. So it is with our present day; this raises the question, what must a functioning member of society know about computing? The Web extra at http://youtu.be/PjR6GqobTBo is an audio podcast of author Grady Booch reading his On Computing column, in which he discusses how much a functioning member of society today should know about computing.},

  abstract={Blocks programming environments (e.g., Scratch, Blockly, App Inventor, Snap!, Pencil Code, Alice/Looking Glass, AgentSheets/AgentCubes) represent program syntax trees as compositions of visual blocks. Through activities like Code.org's Hour of Code, these languages have become extremely popular ways to introduce programming and computational thinking to tens of millions of people of all ages and backgrounds, from grade-schoolers to President Obama. Proponents of blocks languages claim that blocks languages lower barriers to programming and enhance learning, while detractors complain that they are not particularly visual and are just toy languages from which it is difficult to transition to “real” text-based programming.},

  abstract={Programming knowledge tracing (programming KT) aims to analyze the dynamic programming states in solving problems based on historical behaviors and predict future performance. In programming, a student’s thought process can lead to multiple solutions for the same problem. However, current programming KT models attribute learners’ responses only to knowledge mastery and ability, overlooking thought factors, which creates a contradiction between data fitting and the rationalization of the model inference process. To address this, we propose a problem solving-oriented programming KT (SPKT) method that incorporates programming knowledge, computational thinking, and solving ability to improve attribution accuracy. Specifically, we designed a dual-channel attention network based on the principle of initiative gain to retrieve knowledge. Additionally, we utilized the edit tree distance algorithm to capture fine-grained trajectory representations and employed a redress mechanism with gating to update abilities based on code information. Experiments demonstrate SPKT’s superiority.},

  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper describes a study that employs the CTProgER educational process [37] within High School environments to enhance programming skills. Computational Thinking (CT) is recognized as crucial for developing these skills, especially in high school programming education. Teaching programming presents challenges, necessitating improved educational processes and guidelines. Based on the Anthropological Theory of Didactics, CTProgER operates on the principle that human-created entities are interconnected with individuals, forming relationships denoted as R(X,O). This research investigates the efficacy of CTProgER through a rigorous intervention study conducted in a Brazilian Technical and Vocational High School (TV High School). The results reveal a significant performance disparity between the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group showing notable improvements. These findings highlight the potential of CTProgER to guide and enhance programming instruction within high school curricula, offering valuable insights for validating educational processes.},

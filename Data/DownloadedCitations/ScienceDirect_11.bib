abstract = {A scalable parallel algorithm has been designed to study long-time dynamics of many-atom systems based on the nudged elastic band method, which performs mutually constrained molecular dynamics simulations for a sequence of atomic configurations (or states) to obtain a minimum energy path between initial and final local minimum-energy states. A directionally heated nudged elastic band method is introduced to search for thermally activated events without the knowledge of final states, which is then applied to an ensemble of bands in a path ensemble method for long-time simulation in the framework of the transition state theory. The resulting molecular kinetics (MK) simulation method is parallelized with a space–time-ensemble parallel nudged elastic band (STEP-NEB) algorithm, which employs spatial decomposition within each state, while temporal parallelism across the states within each band and band-ensemble parallelism are implemented using a hierarchy of communicator constructs in the Message Passing Interface library. The STEP-NEB algorithm exhibits good scalability with respect to spatial, temporal and ensemble decompositions on massively parallel computers. The MK simulation method is used to study low strain-rate deformation of amorphous silica.}

abstract = {To tackle the problem of efficiently managing increasingly complex systems, simulation models have been widely used. This is because simulation is safer, less expensive, and faster than field implementation and experimenting. To achieve high fidelity and credibility in conducting prediction and exploration of the actual system with simulation models, a rigorous calibration and validation procedure should firstly be applied. However, one of the key issues in calibration is the acquisition of valid source information from the target system. The aim of this study is to develop a systematic method to automatically calibrate a general emergency department model with incomplete data. The simulation-based optimization was used to search for the best value of model parameters. Then we present a case study to particularly demonstrate the way to calibrate an agent-based model of an emergency department with real data scarcity. The case study indicates that the proposed method appears to be capable of properly calibrating and validating the simulation model with incomplete data.}

This paper attempts to fill these gaps by (1) identifying desirable characteristics for the design of such training programs, (2) using these characteristics as guidelines to design a web-based information security training (3) experimentally evaluating the effectiveness of the training using critical outcomes such as training satisfaction, security training performance, self-efficacy, perceived threat severity and susceptibility. We find that web based ISec training that incorporates learner control positively affects training reactions and learning outcomes.}

abstract = {Radiometric dating methods are essential for developing geochronologies to study Late Quaternary environmental change and 210Pb dating is commonly used to produce age-depth models from recent (within 150 years) sediments and other geoarchives. The past two centuries are marked by rapid environmental socio-ecological changes frequently attributed to anthropogenic land-use activities, modified biogeochemical cycles, and climate change. Consequently, historical reconstructions over this recent time interval have high societal value because analyses of these datasets provide understanding of the consequences of environmental modifications, critical ecosystem thresholds, and to define desirable ranges of variation for management, restoration, and conservation. For this information to be used more broadly, for example to support land management decisions or to contribute data to regional analyses of ecosystem change, authors must report all of the useful age-depth model information. However, at present there are no guidelines for researchers on what information should be reported to ensure 210Pb data are fully disclosed, reproducible, and reusable; leading to a plethora of reporting styles, including inadequate reporting that reduces potential reusability and shortening the data lifecycle. For example, 64% of the publications in a literature review of 210Pb dated geoarchives did not include any presentation of age uncertainty estimates in modeled calendar ages used in age-depth models. Insufficient reporting of methods and results used in 210Pb dating geoarchives severely hampers reproducibility and data reusability, especially in analyses that make use of databased palaeoenvironmental data. Reproducibility of data is fundamental to further analyses of the number of palaeoenvironmental data and the spatial coverage of published geoarchives sites. We suggest, and justify, a set of minimum reporting guidelines for metadata and data reporting for 210Pb dates, including an IEDA (Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance), LiPD (Linked Paleo Data) and generic format data presentation templates, to contribute to improvements in data archiving standards and to facilitate the data requirements of researchers analyzing datasets of several palaeoenvironmental study sites. We analyse practices of methods, results and first order interpretation of 210Pb data and make recommendations to authors on effective data reporting and archiving to maximize the value of datasets. We provide empirical evidence from publications and practitioners to support our suggested reporting guidelines. These guidelines increase the scientific value of 210Pb by expanding its relevance in the data lifecycle. Improving quality and fidelity of environmental datasets broadens interdisciplinary use, lengthens the potential lifecycle of data products, and achieves requirements applicable for evidenced-based policy support.}

Recently, the notion of the computational empowerment of children has received attention. However, there are still open issues in our understanding and advocacy of it. A related development is the recent interest in the longer-term impacts of our work. Fast and furious participation of children in design sessions is considered inadequate. We should advocate for longer-term trajectories and possibilities for children to make changes that will influence our world. However, the literature is limited in addressing longer-term impacts. This study taps into these two research gaps and showcases how we have addressed the computational empowerment of children in a project tackling bullying at school through critical design and making. In this paper, we examine in detail the children’s designs and their trajectories from the viewpoint of empowerment and impact: whether and how these children’s designs show potential for the empowerment of those bullied and whether and how their designs have had an impact in the realm of digital technology development. Our study has interesting conceptual and methodological implications for CCI research and practice on the computational empowerment of children and on our design research practice.}

However, it is essential to systematically evaluate such games in order to obtain sound evidence of their impact. Thus, the objective of this article is to present the state of the art on how games for computing education are evaluated. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of a sample of 3617 articles from which 112 relevant articles have been identified, describing 117 studies on the evaluation of games for computing education. Based on these studies we analyzed how evaluations are defined (the analysis factors evaluated, research designs, evaluation models/methods used, kind of data collection instruments, etc.), how they have been executed (sample size and replications) and analyzed (data analysis methods used). As a result, we can confirm that most evaluations use a simple research design in which, typically, the game is used and afterwards subjective feedback is collected via questionnaires from the learners. The majority of the evaluations are run with small samples, without replication, using mostly qualitative methods for data analysis. We also observed that most studies do not use a well-defined evaluation model or method. This shows that there is a need for more rigorous evaluations as well as methodological support in order to assist game creators and instructors to improve such games as well as to systematically support decisions on when or how to include them within instructional units.}

This study overcomes the limitations of previous work exploring relations between individual predictors, by addressing potentially spurious relations due to acting as proxies for other variables. Data were collected from 86 preschool-aged children (36 female) from families with low incomes. Findings revealed that when EF, vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language were included in the same model as concurrent predictors of science, only vocabulary significantly predicted children’s science core knowledge.

Computation and/or symbolic transformations have undoubtedly become one of the dominant trends in modern computer science. In particular, this refers to the execution of the processes of inference of an object with given properties, which is studied with the formation of sets of equalities leading to a target computational model. At the same time, the mathematical theory of computation gets a target equational description, making the process of studying its properties and capabilities more suitable. A model structure based on the method of indexed expressions is developed and applied using the notions of evaluation mapping and assignments. As shown, this may not be considered as generic notion, but derived using the combinators. Thus, the semantics of computation can be derived from the construction of a combinator-as-process. This is the embedding into a system of combinators. A linking system of equalities between combinatorsl is established, which serving as a generic computational model. This allows us to look differently at the previous cognitive ideas of the semantics of computation disabling an evaluation map and assignments and enabling their replacement by a set of equalities between combinators.}

In the present paper, we used a multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) model to examine the temporal dynamics of SRL behaviors as 101 students designed green buildings in Energy3D, a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We examined how different performance groups (i.e., unsuccessful, success-oriented, and mastery-oriented groups) differed in SRL competency, actual SRL behaviors, and SRL networks. We found that the three groups had no significant difference in their perceived SRL competency; however, they differed in SRL behaviors of evaluation. Both the mastery-oriented and success-oriented groups performed more evaluation behaviors than the unsuccessful group. Moreover, the mastery-oriented group showed stronger interaction between SRL behaviors than the success-oriented group and the unsuccessful group. The SRL networks of the three groups shared some similarities, but they were different from each other in general. This study has significant theoretical and methodological implications for the advancement of research in SRL dynamics.}

In this perspective, perceived usability of the online learning platforms that are currently being used is an important aspect, especially due to the absence of any physical classes. In this work Microsoft Teams is used as the reference platform for which the perceived usability is evaluated. For the evaluation purpose a dual strategy is followed by using the System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) based approach, and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which is an Information Systems (IS) based approach. Although both these instruments are popular in their respective domains, yet they have not been considered simultaneously in one work for the purpose of usability evaluation. By doing so, this work attempts to streamline and unify the process of usability evaluation. Results that are obtained from a large-scale survey of university students show the similarity and equivalency between the two methodologies, with the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) construct of TAM having greater similarity with SUS. Moreover, this work also considers the digital-divide aspect (mobile vs. web environment) that is prevalent particularly in developing countries like India, and whether it has any effect on the perceived usability. Results show that the consumption platform does not have any effect on the usability aspect.}

Self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. Yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness. The present study aims at providing a systematic overview and comparison of existing measures of digital self-efficacy (DSE) to current theoretical digital competence frameworks. Further, we present a newly developed scale that assesses digital self-efficacy in heterogeneous adult populations, theoretically founded in the DigComp 2.1 and social-cognition theory. The factorial structure of the DSE scale is assessed to investigate multidimensionality. Further, the scale is validated considering the nomological network (actual ICT use, technophobia).

The results reveal that: (a) Not all RIT characteristics have been given equal consideration in these policy documents; (b) Participatory and deliberate considerations were the most frequently mentioned responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (c) Adaptable, explainable, sustainable, and accountable considerations were the least present responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (d) Many of the considerations overlapped with each other as local governments were at the early stages of identifying them. Furthermore, the paper summarised strategies aimed at assisting local authorities in identifying their strengths and weaknesses in responsible AI characteristics, thereby facilitating their transformation into governing entities with responsible AI practices. The study informs local government policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on the critical aspects of responsible AI policymaking.}

abstract = {Coding is a highly valued skill used in many disciplines across the globe. However, it is reported that students’ coding interest and self-efficacy are usually low. Theoretically, the affective domain of coding is in its infancy, and very few studies have set out to identify the determinants of coding interest and self-efficacy. This study explored how mathematics interest and self-efficacy, as two important mathematics-related factors, influenced coding interest and self-efficacy. Employing a quantitative cross-sectional survey design, 605 students from two public senior high schools in two big cities in China were investigated. A two-step structural equation modeling approach was adopted to analyze the data. Findings showed that mathematics interest, directly and indirectly, influenced coding interest significantly. In addition, coding self-efficacy was indirectly impacted by mathematics interest and coding interest was indirectly impacted by mathematics self-efficacy significantly. Most importantly, our model has proved to be powerful in explaining coding interest. This study contributes to the theoretical and practical understanding of the relationship between mathematics and coding attitudes, seldom explored in senior high school settings.}

abstract = {The technological revolution, particularly the availability of more data and more powerful computational tools, has led to the emergence of a new scientific field called “Computational Diplomacy”. Our work tries to define its scope and focuses on a popular subarea of it, namely “Digital Democracy”. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using digital technologies to promote more participatory forms of democracy. While there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. It is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. This paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies. We argue that more research on how digital technologies can be used to support democracy upgrade is needed. Along these lines, we lay out a research agenda for the future.}

abstract = {Digital technology has brought new opportunities for language education. Multimodal literacy refers to the ability to read, watch, understand, respond to, and generate multimodal texts. Multimodality, promoted by scholars, generates meaning in multiple modes. Hence, digital storytelling (DST) presented with multimodal content has been extensively applied in second language instruction. However, traditional DST is mostly presented in videos with one-way communication; it lacks two-way communication with the audience and is only regarded as a learning method for knowledge acquisition. As a result, the present study proposed a robot-based DST (robot-DST) approach to facilitate the interaction in the DST process and to enhance students' engagement. In order to evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an EFL course at a senior high school. Two classes of 11th graders participated in the experiment. One class with 40 students was the experimental group adopting the robot-DST approach, while the other class with 40 students was the control group adopting the conventional animation-based DST (CA-DST) approach. The results showed that the robot-DST approach could significantly reduce students' communication apprehension, as well as enhance their English speaking ability, storytelling ability, narrative engagement, and communication tendency. The findings show that using robots in the context of digital storytelling design has great potential for promoting learners’ language learning performances. Accordingly, in-depth discussion and suggestions for future research are provided for researchers and school teachers who intend to use robots in educational settings.}

Its mission is to educate and train ethical, critical, and humanistic forensic scientists capable of conducting inquiries that meet scientific quality standards and assist the justice system in firmly linking legal rulings to the available evidence. At the time, it was the first such program in the country, and the contributions that interdisciplinary forensic scientists could make to criminal investigations were largely unknown among forensic and legal practitioners. During its existence, providing an interdisciplinary, competence-based education to students has been one of the main challenges. To overcome it, teaching and assessment approaches—centered on the achievement of specifically forensic competencies as learning outcomes and the integration of forensic disciplines towards the resolution of simulated cases—have been devised to help develop the professional skill set expected of graduates. The COVID-19 pandemic led to adapting these approaches to distance or hybrid modes of learning, increasing their versatility and enriching the pedagogic repertoire of the FSUP. Currently, the main impact of the program lies in the successful incorporation of some of its graduates to agencies belonging to or related to the criminal justice system, such as the National Prosecutor’s Office, the Commission for Truth and Justice for the Ayotzinapa Case, and the National Commission for the Search of Missing and Disappeared Persons, among others.}

Middle childhood also is marked by increasing digital game play, arguably the most common form of child–computer interactions during this developmental period. For example, children between the ages of 6 and 8 play digital games 60–90 min per day and 47% of 3rd to 8th grade teachers reported using digital games in their classrooms several times a week (Vega & Robb, 2019). Surprisingly, how content learning and cognition may be facilitated through digital gaming remains sparsely investigated among children during this period. In the studies that do examine the linkages between game play and content learning or cognition, research methodologies vary markedly. The goal of this narrative review is to help bring greater cohesion to the research literature, which often spans many disciplines. This review emphasizes the games, measurement of outcomes, and research designs that have been used to examine content learning and cognitive skills among children ages 6 to 12 in the context of digital games.}

This integrative review investigates the conceptualizations and measurements of DC, across disciplines, in the extant literature. A systematic search of 11 databases identified a total of 350 unique items that contain “digital citizenship” in the title or keywords published by December 2018, with the majority published after 2010. Of these, 114 were peer-reviewed journal articles published in a wide range of discipline-specific venues, more than half of which were education-related. In-depth analyses show that each of the dominant conceptualizations of DC has been adopted by different disciplines, albeit with different popularities in adoption. Findings also revealed widely shared stakeholder concerns and research foci in DC research across the disciplines. However, there is a stark lack of empirical research on the young children, and an absence of commonly deployed research instruments in DC-related research. The present integrative review implicates the need for interdisciplinary collaboration for significant advances in DC research to address issues in policy and practice.}

In this study, 134 (quasi-)experimental studies on augmented reality (AR) in education from 2012 to 2021 were reviewed to discern the impact of AR on three levels of learning outcomes, namely response, knowledge and skill, and performance. The 134 studies are the data of this study for meta-analysis, which were obtained following the procedure of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis. Moreover, meta-regression was employed to investigate important factors relating to the variation of the impact, including educational level, subject area, treatment duration, and AR affordance. Findings from the meta-analysis suggest that AR technology has benefited all three learning outcomes, with a larger mean effect size on the outcome of performance. Furthermore, the meta-regression results indicate treatment duration as a significant factor likely relating to the variation in the impact of AR in education. Moreover, AR used to support the learning of languages or social studies is likely associated with higher positive learner responses such as learning motivation or attitude than AR used for science learning. The meta-regression result indicated that use of 3-D visualization in AR needs to be carefully designed and evaluated. The implications of using AR to support learning, the design of AR learning environments, and the future direction of research are discussed.}

This paper presents a framework of employee skills and competencies useful for developing occupational profiles for employees of companies transitioning towards Industry 4.0. The paper consists of a discussion of the theoretical and practical parts of case studies. The theoretical portion was created on the basis of a review of scientific literature and research studies regarding the competencies and skills of employees in the ongoing fourth industrial revolution. This part focuses on the skills profile of an Industry 4.0 employee and an Operator 4.0 (O4.0) from a creativity and innovativeness point of view. The link between the theoretical part and the case study analysis was a general framework for building the competencies and skills of the steelworker in the emerging fourth industrial revolution. The case study analysis covered the framework of competencies and skills of a metallurgist in smart manufacturing built into the organization of steel mills. Recruitment offers of a steel company implementing smart manufacturing (SM) projects and educational programmes of technical universities in the field of metallurgy were analysed. The aim of the study was to develop a framework for the profile of an employee working in an innovative company transforming to I4.0. The publication posed the following research questions (purposes/hypotheses): P1. To what extent do Polish companies in the metallurgical sector pay attention to creativity and innovation issues when looking for employees? P2. To what extent do the profile (portfolio) of metallurgy graduates of Polish technical universities turn their attention to the issues related to creativity and innovation?}

Successful decision depends firstly on the ability of data publishers to understand the anonymization techniques and their associated algorithms. In this paper, we focus on the choice of an algorithm among the different ones implementing one of the anonymization techniques, namely generalization. Through an abstraction process presented in this paper, we provide data publishers with simplified descriptions for the generalization technique and its algorithms. These descriptions facilitate the understanding of the algorithms by data publishers having low programing skills. We present also some other use cases of these abstractions as well as an experimentation conducted to validate them.}

Many CS&E courses are compressed add-ons to existing programs and, consequently, must cover a breadth of topics encompassing modules from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and application disciplines. Additionally, these courses would benefit from embedded 21st century skills, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and lifelong learning behaviors, but such skills are often neglected in course design even though the education and workforce literature are clear about their importance for future careers. The breadth and complexity in course design necessary to incorporate all of these components create a challenge for instructors and students. In this interpretive study, we investigate student experiences and perceived outcomes in a technology-mediated graduate-level CS&E course designed to address the difficulties associated with this wide range of disciplinary topics and professional skills. Our course design is based on reflective practice and principles of metacognition, and applies elements such as a flipped classroom, student journals, and reflective writing exercises; these design goals directly support students’ metacognition and foster self-regulated learning behaviors that, in turn, develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. We evaluate this design using student reflective writing and surveys. Results indicate reflective writing activities in course design helped develop students’ metacognitive awareness, self-regulated learning behaviors, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. This course design can serve as a template for others teaching technology-mediated courses in CS&E and related areas, and aiming to develop students’ 21st century professional skills.}

We use the research idea of common attributes and key chain clustering-factor association selection-analysis of the driving force and subordination among factors-the key characteristics of AI talents. Using collinear analysis of citations and grounded theory methods, an operational definition of the influencing factors of AI talent literacy characteristics is constructed. Using the Interpretative Structural Modeling(ISM) and MICMAC (Matrice d’Impacts Croises-Multipication Applique A Classement), analyze and identify the driving force and subordination of the influencing factors of key traits of talents, and present the combined effect of multi-level factors of key traits of talents. Combined with the educational differences and complementary advantages in the GBA, five strategies and seven implementation suggestions for the GBA's AI talent education cooperation plan are formulated to establish a collaborative ecosystem that promotes the growth and integration of AI in the GBA.}

HR development is one of the principles of SHRM that should be implemented consistently along with other SHRM principles, which means, e.g., that the development of employees should be carried out having a long-term perspective in mind. It is crucial to acquire the so-called competencies of the future as the basis for implementing the idea of Industry 4.0. The purpose of the article is to present the development of human potential in an organization against the background of other detailed sustainable HRM principles, to be followed by confronting the theory and the research results on the development of future competencies referring to industrial engineers in Poland as the professional group responsible for implementing the idea of cleaner production and Industry 4.0. The Author analyzed the results of three research projects based on the survey method and representative data from Eurostat and Statistics Poland. The conducted research shows that industrial companies in Poland have more of a short-sighted perspective when it comes to developing the potential of their engineers. The HR development practices focusing only on current needs are not in line with the SHRM principles of a long-term perspective and flexibility. There is also a visible lack of employee participation in the process of making training-related decisions, which is another principle of sustainable HRM. In addition, environmental sustainability remains a neglected area of knowledge in terms of training, and the cooperation with external educational institutions is low. It results in certain implications for HR managers and educational institutions. The article also presents directions for further research.}

We initially provide a brief summary of the idea of a 21st century skill, then trace the conceptual changes in the idea of ICT literacy in four main steps: First, we briefly describe a concentration of knowledge about computers and their use, coalescing into the concept of ICT literacy in the early years of the field. Second, we describe the transition to a view of ICT literacy as a broad set of skills that have links to many traditional and non-traditional school subjects, and the move to technology integration in education. Third, we see the next transition for ICT literacy expressed as progress variables that are essential tools for the design of curriculum and assessments. Fourth, we discuss the impact of the “social network” perspective on ICT literacy—the critical need for building the power of virtual skills through proficiency with networks of people, information, tools, and resources. In summary, we offer a new framework for assessing student ICT learning, based on a learning progression and social networking point of view. Throughout, we use extensive examples to help illustrate our review of the broad sweep of this development, and, as a part of the conclusion, we speculate about the coming next steps.}

The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies (IJHCS) has been a key venue for much seminal work in this field, including its first foundations, and we review the changing research concerns seen in publications over these five decades. We relate this thematic evolution to research taking place over the same period within more specialist communities, especially the Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG), the Empirical Studies of Programming series (ESP), and the ongoing community in Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC). Many other communities have interacted with psychology of programming, both influenced by research published within the specialist groups, and in turn influencing research priorities. We end with an overview of the core theories that have been developed over this period, as an introductory resource for new researchers, and also with the authors’ own analysis of key priorities for future research.}

One medium that has affordances to assess and support creativity in young people is video games. In this paper, we briefly discuss the literature on video games and creativity and provide an example of current work being done relative to measuring creativity in the context of a game called Physics Playground using stealth assessment. To validate the stealth assessment of creativity, we conducted a one-group pretest-posttest study with 167 8th and 9th graders from a K-12 school in Florida. Results suggest that our stealth assessment of creativity is valid (i.e., our stealth assessment estimate significantly correlated with our external performance-based measures of creativity). Additional analyses revealed that creativity (i.e., estimated using our stealth assessment of creativity) significantly predicts in-game performance (e.g., number of levels solved), game enjoyment, and learning of physics content. We conclude with a discussion of future directions in this line of creativity research.}

The Owlet program was pilot tested in ten classrooms, spanning students ages 5 to 11. We found that teachers used the exploratory activities to introduce the program, and other activities to encourage differentiated, student-paced practice of math concepts. Students were interested and engaged in using Owlet during the pilot tests, leading to student driven generation of challenges. Through development, Owlet, as a whole program, spanned more math concepts by prioritizing flexibility in one tangible interface and concreteness in the other. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each tangible device.}

We believe that the field of CCIU is at an important point in its development, analogous to when a child becomes a teen. Over the last few years we have each had many informal conversations with other CCI researchers in which we discuss issues such as, what is our responsibility as researchers beyond academe? What values underlie our conceptions of a ”good” childhood and the role of interactive technology in it? And, how do we ensure that our field continues to grow and evolve in ways that are consistent with our responsibilities and values? To address these and other complex questions that have been drawing our attention we came together to reflect, discuss and create a position paper for our community, in which we outline some of the issues we see facing our community at this time. To inform our deliberations with opinions beyond our own we conducted an informal consultation with 25 members of the CCI community. Our responders spanned junior to senior researchers, represented diverse geographies and included industry practitioners. These diverse responses provided further content for our reflections, and helped us see perspectives beyond our own. The result of this informal process is this speculative paper in which we propose a series of seven provocations that aim to disrupt some of the normative assumptions held in our field. Our goal in doing this is to open up dialogue in our community about these issues and promote consideration of the alternative visions we present for where we might focus our attention and efforts. We see our contribution not as truth or a definitive statement of a vision for the field, but rather as our opinion about some of the complex issues we face and that we think should be considered through dialogue as we move into the next phase of our development as an academic and scholarly community. We believe that it is urgent and critical for our field that we take up these questions, explore diverse perspectives, and critically work towards decisions and actions that will define our identity and the value of our contributions as we move forward into the next 20 years of research in CCI.}

Today's increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. Algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be influenced by prejudice, conflicts of interest, or fatigue. However, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. In this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric AI: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy.}

This study proposes a creativity approach to facilitating participatory learning for the sustained engagement of young learners based on the principle of remix practice, which consists of learning to generate online artefacts, endless hybridization and scaffolding. This study investigated students' engagement in and perceptions of the creative learning process during a two-year participatory learning program. Data collected included students’ flow perceptions during a 39-week activity, their motivation and creative self-efficacy before and after the intervention, as well as their creative products. The findings indicated that the remix-oriented approach led to a higher level of intrinsic motivation and sustained flow compared to a model-based approach, especially interest and curiosity, in this participatory learning program. The approach also helped the students to perceive a significant increase in their level of creative self-efficacy associated with strategies to generate creative ideas. The results of this study suggest that the principle of remix practice is helpful for leveraging knowledge acquisition and the creative nature of participatory learning activities to sustain student engagement in participatory learning programs.}

Our curriculum is designed to introduce students early to parallel and distributed computing topics and to expose students to these topics repeatedly in the context of a wide variety of CS courses. The key to our approach is the development of a required intermediate-level course that serves as an introduction to computer systems and parallel computing. It serves as a requirement for every CS major and minor and is a prerequisite to upper-level courses that expand on parallel and distributed computing topics in different contexts. With the addition of this new course, we are able to easily make room in upper-level courses to add and expand parallel and distributed computing topics. The goal of our curricular design is to ensure that every graduating CS major has exposure to parallel and distributed computing, with both a breadth and depth of coverage. Our curriculum is particularly designed for the constraints of a small liberal arts college, however, much of its ideas and its design are applicable to any undergraduate CS curriculum.}

With this objective, this paper presents a set of metamodels that could facilitate the conceptual design of this type of games. To this end, a complete graphical notation based on the UML standard (with adaptations) is defined for representing the components of this type of games; having in mind to improve the collaboration between the team of educators/students and the technical team during the design process. Finally, the design diagrams defined during the production of a specific serious game, titled Uranus, are illustrated, in order to show the feasibility of the proposal. In addition, a validation experience was conducted with educators and computer engineering students in order to test the value of the proposed graphic notation to design educational games.}

VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.}

To date, it has been moderately successful, with the inclusion of some PDC topics in the ACM/IEEE Computer Science curriculum guidelines in 2013 (CS13) and mentions of PDC topics in the Computing Curricula 2020. Additionally, some universities in the U.S. and around the world have started to cover some of these topics in early CS courses. Lack of knowledge of or training in PDC topics among instructors, along with the need to align early CS course content with prescribed learning objectives in the curricula, are often cited as hurdles for adoption in early CS courses. There have been attempts at bringing PDC materials, such as textbook chapters, lecture slides, assignments, and demos to assist instructors of early CS classes. However, the effort required on the part of the instructor to figure out what is relevant to a particular class can be daunting. In this work, we contend that simultaneously classifying pedagogical materials against the CS13 and the PDC12 curriculum guidelines can address some of the challenges faced by instructors and can promote broader adoption of PDC materials in early CS courses. We present CS Materials, a system that can be used to categorize pedagogical materials according to well-known and established curricular guidelines. We show that CS Materials can be leveraged 1) by instructors of early CS courses to find materials that are similar to the one that they use but that also cover PDC topics, and 2) by instructors to check the coverage of topics (and gaps) in a course, and 3) by PDC experts to identify topics for which PDC instructional materials do not exist or are insufficient in order to inform development of additional PDC curricular materials.}

The paper focuses on scientific competency and the challenges involved in the itinerary from policy documents to classrooms are addressed in three sections: (i) an analysis is made of the changes in the science curriculum as a consequence of the emphasis on scientific competency, comparing the assessment criteria in the previous and current steering documents; (ii) trends in teacher education are discussed; (iii) the findings of the diagnostic evaluation are analyzed. The paper is framed in a theoretical approach, viewing students’ participation in scientific practices, and the development of higher-order thinking as necessary goals of science education. We argue that the focus on competencies, characterized as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new contexts, involves a major change towards knowledge transfer and higher-order thinking skills. Some issues emerging from the analysis relate to the implications of assessment criteria and the challenges involved in its implementation, to the trends in teacher professional development and the difficulties related to the current economic crisis and to the results of the diagnostic evaluation and time frame needed for reforms to have an impact. It is argued that the development of both competencies and higher-order thinking requires students’ prolonged engagement.}

However, with regard to inquiry facilitating conceptual understanding, teachers at township and rural schools believe a didactic approach to be more effective than learners doing inquiry, whilst teachers at suburban and urban schools favour an inquiry-based approach in this regard. The significance of this study is that the lack of resources, large classes, and the limited exposure to inquiry of learners at township and rural schools constrain the implementation of inquiry-based learning at these schools, and result in teachers at such schools resorting to a didactic pedagogy.}

Understanding how virtual learning environments (VLEs) can foster WHC is becoming exceedingly important because it problematizes the marketisation of childhood and youth. It also offers new ways of considering educational futures including implications for the theoretical understanding of creativity within VLEs. We report on the theoretical development of the concept of WHC within C2Learn, a three-year project designing a digital gaming environment that provides children and young people with multiple opportunities to engage in co-creativity to foster their WHC. C2Learn is the first time WHC has actively been conceptualised in a digital context. We present our over-arching co-creativity conceptual framework which has been developed to frame the specific kind of co-creativity that is envisaged within C2Learn’s VLE. Drawing on that framework, we present a co-creativity assessment methodology specifically focused on evaluating the presence of WHC. We argue that leveraging WHC within VLEs broadens perspectives on the purposes of education, as this ethically framed creativity foregrounds the role of values in generating fundamental small-scale creative change through ‘journeys of becoming’ that have the potential to generate ‘quiet revolutions’ or small cumulative, incremental changes over time which are meaningful to a particular community.}

abstract = {“Big data” is a term that has been used often in the past decade to describe datasets that are extremely large and complex so that traditional software is unable to store and analyze them in an accurate way. It can refer to “long data,” “wide data,” and both. Big data is of increasing importance in healthcare as well: new methods dedicated to improving data collection, storage, cleaning, processing, and interpretation for medical research continue to be developed. Exploiting new tools and methods to extract meaning from large volume information has the potential to drive real change in clinical practice, and combining this novel data-driven research with the classical hypothesis-driven research will have a large impact on personalized healthcare. However, significant challenges remain. Here we discuss the challenges (and possible solutions) posed to biomedical research by our increasing ability to collect, store, and analyze large datasets. Important challenges include: (1) the need for standardization of data content, format, and clinical definitions, adhering to the FAIR guiding principles; (2) the need for collaborative networks with sharing of both data and expertise, for example through a federated approach; (3) stricter privacy and ethics regulations, in particular the GDPR in the European Union; and (4) a need to reconsider how and when analytic methodology (data science) is taught to medical researchers. Overcoming these challenges will help to make a success of the use of big data in medical and translational research.}

The rationality of block scale and structure is the guarantee of vitality and humanization quality, facing complex and diverse problems, and the structure reconstruction of urban built-up areas is one of the most difficult challenges in the process of promoting the block system. The traditional planning-construction strategy, as practice in recent years has demonstrated, faces challenges in terms of construction costs, demolition costs, property rights, and jurisprudence. Based on the interaction of the block structure and external space, the study presents a “implant-reconstruction” model. It investigates possibilities of implanting elements and graphically depicts the potential impact of implant-reconstruction using Space Syntax. The findings indicate that the external space implantation mode may actively encourage the construction of small-scale blocks and has benefits in terms of texture respect, low impact, and ease of operation. The simulation and pre-judgment dynamically illustrate the viable path and gives a scientific reference for block alteration.}

Previous work has shown that technology, and specifically tangible toys, could have the potential to support social attention in autistic children. A key challenge is knowing how to design and use interactive and intelligent technologies to support interaction in autistic children, given the heterogeneity in levels of social motivation, social development, and interest in digital technologies. To address this challenge, we examined in detail the interaction between digital features and autistic children’s joint engagement in a real-world setting, exploring the impact of tangible constraints in fostering social interaction. The current study observed autistic children (aged between 12 and 15 years) playing with a digital robotic toy and a non-digital counterpart, and measured social attention and engagement during free play. The results showed that increased and higher levels of joint attention when children had to share a toy between them, on both digital and non-digital interfaces. We found that autistic children individually vary in their propensity to engage in social interactions, as well as their responses to digital features. This work contributes to a growing area of evidence that tangible and smart technologies can create social opportunities for autistic children.}

This can lead to cognitive bias, resulting in students developing more favorable and even enthusiastic perceptions of entrepreneurial action. To reduce this information asymmetry, the intention of this study was to identify and classify the diversity of negative aspects resulting from unsuccessful entrepreneurial action. To this end, we applied the content analysis technique to the transcripts of interviews with former entrepreneurs and stakeholders associated with entrepreneurial action, in addition to the texts of articles from important journals of Entrepreneurship and Small Business identified through a scope literature review. The findings indicate that unsuccessful entrepreneurial action can result in several negative effects for the entrepreneur, both subjectively (psychological and social aspects - dark side) and objectively (material aspects - downside). The study also identified several negative effects that impact other individuals and society (destructive side). The literature review and interaction with former entrepreneurs and professionals who work with entrepreneurs showed 38 negative aspects in the three dimensions known as “Triple Ds” (dark, destructive and downside). A taxonomy tree was developed that integrates these different types and subtypes, as well as software (https://thetripleds.com/) that makes these contents available. These resources can be used by EE professors, managers and technicians of agencies that support entrepreneurs to raise the awareness of potential entrepreneurs regarding the various risks associated with entrepreneurial action.}

The paper discusses global educational trends, with a particular focus on the tendencies in the demand for labour both in Russia and in the world. The paper aims to describe changes in attitudes towards the relevance of specialist qualifications and the sufficiency of professional competencies acquired through education. In addition, the analysis of structural changes in the Russian system of vocational education starting from 1990 to the present day is given. The research is carried out using the methods of comparative and statistical analysis. The competency maps of future are drawn (Institute for the Future, Palo Alto, the USA), including the description of trends that alter the habitual context for the labour force, as well as key skills needed for a successful career. The ‘Atlas of New Professions’ describing most promising professions in the field of education is reviewed. It is shown that the country’s role in the international division of labour can be used as an objective criterion to assess the performance of the country’s educational system. In this respect, the data on Russia’s position in the world rankings of competitiveness, innovation development and human development index, as well as the comparative data on the rate that Russian companies demonstrate in terms of innovative activity and technology exports are provided. The analysis of disproportions in the structure of graduates both in terms of levels and specialities of vocational education for the period 1990–2013 is given. Key problems faced by the Russian vocational education system are considered, including a weak focus on the actual needs of national economy and global changes in the labour market, a decline in the quality of training and the number of working specialities, as well as the low flexibility of educational programs.}

Our central premise is that the trajectory necessary to be expert in the emergent fields in front of them requires acceleration at an early time point. Both pathology (and biomedical) informatics are new disciplines which would benefit from involvement by students at an early stage of their education. In 2009, Michael T Lotze MD, Kirsten Livesey (then a medical student, now a medical resident at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)), Richard Hersheberger, PhD (Currently, Dean at Roswell Park), and Megan Seippel, MS (the administrator) launched the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Summer Academy to bring high school students for an 8 week summer academy focused on Cancer Biology. Initially, pathology and biomedical informatics were involved only in the classroom component of the UPCI Summer Academy. In 2011, due to popular interest, an informatics track called Computer Science, Biology and Biomedical Informatics (CoSBBI) was launched. CoSBBI currently acts as a feeder program for the undergraduate degree program in bioinformatics at the University of Pittsburgh, which is a joint degree offered by the Departments of Biology and Computer Science. We believe training in bioinformatics is the best foundation for students interested in future careers in pathology informatics or biomedical informatics. We describe our approach to the recruitment, training and research mentoring of high school students to create a pipeline of exceptionally well-trained applicants for both the disciplines of pathology informatics and biomedical informatics. We emphasize here how mentoring of high school students in pathology informatics and biomedical informatics will be critical to assuring their success as leaders in the era of big data and personalized medicine.}

Many scholars share the assumption that leisure-time digital consumption is associated with computer science (CS) affinity, but there is a dearth of research evidence for this relationship. Female students generally spend less time on gaming and more time on social media than do male students, so a gender comparison perspective is helpful. Using multinomial logistic regression analysis on a national sample of 10,197 U.S. college students in introductory CS courses, we found that frequent computer gameplay was strongly associated with an increase in the probability of CS career interest relative to a Non-STEM career interest (β = -0.17, se = 0.06, p < .01) for both male (N = 7214) and female students (N = 2659). In contrast, increased social media use predicted a higher CS career interest relative to a Science/Engineering career interest (β = 0.12, se = 0.06, p < .05) for female students by 8%, however, a lower interest for male students by 4%.}

As new AI implementations continue to emerge, it is crucial to enable children to engage critically with AI. Critical literacy objectives and practices can encourage children to question, critique, and transform the social, political, cultural, and ethical implications of AI. As an initial step towards critical AI education, we conducted a 10-year scoping review to identify publications reporting on activities that engage children, between the ages of 5 and 18, to address the critical implications of AI. Our review identifies a wide range of participants, content, and pedagogical approaches. Through framework synthesis guided by an established critical literacy model, we examine the critical literacy learning objectives embedded in the reported activities and propose a critical AI literacy framework. This paper outlines future opportunities for critical AI literacies in the field of child–computer interaction including inspiring new learning activities, encouraging inclusive perspectives, and supporting pragmatic curriculum integration.}

Where once all novices learned to program in conventional text-based languages, today, there exists a growing ecosystem of approaches to programming including graphical, tangible, and scaffolded text environments. To date, relatively little work has explored the relationship between the design of novice programming environments and the programming practices they engender in their users. This paper seeks to shed light on this dimension of learning to program through the careful analysis of novice programmers’ experiences learning with a hybrid block/text programming environment. Specifically, this paper is concerned with how novices leverage the various affordances designed into programming environments and programming languages to support their early efforts to author programs. We explore this relationship through the construct of modality using data from a study conducted in a high school computer science classroom in which students spent five weeks working in block-based, text-based, and hybrid block/text programming environments. This paper uses a detailed vignette of a novice writing a program in the hybrid environment as a way to characterize emerging programming practices, then presents analyses of programming trends from the full study population to speak to the generality of the practices identified in the vignette. The analyses focus not only on characterizing authoring strategies but also on identifying patterns in novices’ help-seeking behaviors. By focusing on how modality influences novices’ emerging programming practices, this paper contributes to our understanding of the relationship between programming environment and learning, illuminating the role of design in shaping introductory programming experiences.}

However, through a systematic analysis of 75 research-based storytelling systems and 39 commercial systems, we find that there remains a problematic gap between research and practice with respect to products in interactive storytelling and child–computer interaction, echoing the well-documented research-practice gap in the general HCI field. We characterize the nature of this gap, highlighting design themes promoted by research-based systems that are not as prevalent in commercial systems, such as tangibility and narrative scaffolds, and vice-versa. Understanding the main areas of discrepancy between research and practice can help focus efforts to close the research-practice gap in storytelling systems for children.}

abstract = {Social robots have been and are currently being used in many projects, research initiatives and experiments, but we know relatively little about them compared to humans when performing a social task such as teaching. Using an experiment in which a robot and a human teacher were used for teaching computational concepts to a group of K-12 students, the main goal of this paper is not to analyze the scores obtained in the post-test performed, but to focus on the students' attitudes towards robots. In order to do this, a version of the NARS and RAS questionnaires, adapted for children, was used. The analysis of the results of these questionnaires considers differences between age groups and students lectured by a robot vs. a human teacher. We conclude that age is the main factor that affects students’ attitudes towards robots, although we also found other differences between the robot and the human teacher group.}

A cross-sectional, descriptive, and quantitative research was conducted with 252 students from a public university in Mexico. Transversal skills, socioformative project-based practices, learning strategies, and the relevance of online activities were assessed using validated rubrics. The results indicated a low level of development in three transversal skills: research, entrepreneurship, and English, with the latter being the poorest rated. Critical and creative thinking exhibited the highest level of development. In the didactic component, socioformative project-based pedagogical practices and learning strategies showed acceptable levels. Students expressed satisfaction with complementary online activities, showing a preference for interactive videos and short videos under 4 min. Regression analysis and structural equations were used to examine the relationships between various factors. Results demonstrated that socioformative project-based pedagogical practices, learning strategies, and online education positively correlated with the development of transversal skills. Furthermore, a higher level of transversal skills was associated with better academic averages among students. Socioformative project-based pedagogical practices also correlated with academic performance through transversal skills. The study concludes that integrating online activities into on-campus programs, based on the socioformative pedagogical model, can enhance the development of transversal skills and improve academic performance. Further research into the implementation of this educational model and its long-term impact on university education and professional success is recommended.}

In this paper, we report on the findings of employing a multimodal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methodology to investigate the temporal learning processes of two types of learners that have learning gains and a type that does not have learning gains in an open-ended collaborative learning activity. Considering log data, speech behavior, affective states and gaze patterns, we find that all learners start from a similar state of non-productivity, but once out of it they are unlikely to fall back into that state, especially in the case of the learners that have learning gains. Those who have learning gains shift between two problem solving strategies, each characterized by both exploratory and reflective actions, as well as demonstrate speech and gaze patterns associated with these strategies, that differ from those who don't have learning gains. Further, the teams that have learning gains also differ between themselves in the manner in which they employ the problem solving strategies over the interaction, as well as in the manner they express negative emotions while exhibiting a particular strategy. These outcomes contribute to understanding the multiple pathways of learning in an open-ended collaborative learning environment, and provide actionable insights for designing effective interventions.}

Precision goes beyond the structural elements of language to the disciplinary meaning that those elements communicate. In this article, we define precision and distinguish it from vocabulary, accuracy, and complexity. Then, we highlight divergent conceptions of precision in content standards and ELP standards. In light of these divergent conceptions, we present work samples from an elementary science classroom to illustrate how precision of disciplinary meaning is essential to engaging in disciplinary practices of content standards.

Because in-situ monitoring of mangroves is difficult and time-consuming, remote sensing technologies are commonly used to monitor these ecosystems. Landsat satellites have provided regular and systematic images of mangrove ecosystems for over 30 years, yet researchers often cite budget and infrastructure constraints to justify the underuse this resource. Since 2001, over 50 studies have used Landsat or ASTER imagery for mangrove monitoring, and most focus on the spatial extent of mangroves, rarely using more than five images. Even after the Landsat archive was made free for public use, few studies used more than five images, despite the clear advantages of using more images (e.g. lower signal-to-noise ratios). The main argument of this paper is that, with freely available imagery and high performance computing facilities around the world, it is up to researchers to acquire the necessary programming skills to use these resources. Programming skills allow researchers to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as image acquisition and processing, consequently reducing up to 60% of the time dedicated to these activities. These skills also help scientists to review and re-use algorithms, hence making mangrove research more agile. This paper contributes to the debate on why scientists need to learn to program, not only to challenge prevailing approaches to mangrove research, but also to expand the temporal and spatial extents that are commonly used for mangrove research.}

Although this trend is currently limited to middle school, high school, and higher education, prior research suggests that children 5 years and older, may yield long-term gains from exploring developmentally-appropriate concepts from novel STEM fields. Although there is little research on educational technologies or resources to support young children’s curiosity and learning in this novel domain, some research suggests that young children may already be forming preconceptions about genetics and biology (e.g., from popular media). Tangible technologies, which provide children qualitatively new, developmentally appropriate ways to engage with ideas and techniques, have been shown to support children’s engagement with foundational ideas relevant to biodesign, including the engineering design process. By applying developmentally appropriate constraints to our technology development (e.g., through frameworks such as the Positive Technological Development), the research team developed and evaluated a novel tangible technology called CRISPEE to introduce young children to concepts of biology and engineering. This article describes an experimental pilot study to investigate (1) how young children interact with the CRISPEE technological prototype, and (2) what prior knowledge the average child might bring to an educational biodesign activity. Implications for ongoing technology development and developmentally appropriate learning goals are discussed.}

However, the teaching and learning of concepts related to size and scale present major challenges because objects at certain scales are unable to be perceived by humans with the naked eye. A potential way to overcome this challenge could be by means of learning strategies coupled with multimedia learning. In this study we propose learning strategies, instantiated by multimedia are for learning tools that may result in improved learning of size and scale cognition based on the FS2C framework. This framework consists of five levels to characterize size and scale cognition and the cognitive processes supporting them. Participants of this quasi-experimental design included 224 undergraduate students who experienced one of three different multimedia for learning tools, and then were assessed through five tasks whose design was based on the FS2C framework. Results suggest that learning strategies prompting students to compare objects of different sizes, may increase their abilities in ordering and classifying objects. Having students to interact with a logarithmic scale may also have increased participant posttest performance scores in the numerical proportional and absolute measurement tasks. Finally, we propose that the use of multimedia for learning affordances like 3D interaction, zoom in and zoom out, and direct interaction with a scale metaphor may help students make explicit connections and become familiar with objects of different sizes and scales.}

abstract = {Background
Digital behavioral interventions have become increasingly popular for their ability to support patient diagnosis and treatment, chronic disease self-management, behavior change, and adherence to recommended care. However, digital intervention development is impeded by challenges such as limited technical skills, limited access to developers, and cost. The purpose of this study is to elicit in-depth qualitative feedback from intervention developers who have interest in digital behavioral interventions but lack programming skills regarding the barriers they experience and key considerations in the design and implementation of digital interventions.
Objective
This study aims to understand barriers in the design and implementation of digital behavioral interventions, as well as to identify key considerations for researchers who are developing these interventions.
Methods
We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 18 researchers who had experience either designing (but not coding) digital behavioral interventions or running research studies with them. Participants were a convenience sample of users of the Computerized Intervention Authoring System platform, an existing no-code development platform for building digital intervention content, and were recruited through either direct email solicitation or snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted and recorded over videoconference between February and April 2020. Recordings from interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed by multiple coders.
Results
Interviews were completed with 18 participants and lasted between 24 and 65 (mean 46.9, SD 11.3) minutes. Interviewees were predominantly female (17/18, 94%) and represented different job roles, ranging from researcher to project/study staff. Three key barriers in the development of digital behavior interventions were identified during interviews: lack of cross-disciplinary understanding; variability in recipients’ technology access, infrastructure, and literacy; and the idea that evidence-based in-person interactions do not translate directly to digital interactions. Interviewees identified several key considerations that interventionists learned to prioritize, which have the potential to overcome these barriers and lead to successful interventions.
Conclusions
Barriers in the development of digital behavioral interventions are often created by a lack of cross-disciplinary understanding, which can lead to difficulties conceptualizing interventions, unrealistic expectations in terms of cost, and confusion about the development process. Moreover, concerns about research study participant characteristics and access to technology, as well as the translation of in-person interventions to digital, are apparent. Appropriate training in how to work with software development teams may help future digital behavior intervention creators overcome these barriers and may lead to new, exciting innovations in this space.}

Moving forward, adopting Industry 4.0 is an evident requirement for manufacturers to remain competitive. Currently, in the early stages of adoption in most industries and countries, there is an evident lack of foundational Industry 4.0 knowledge among decision-makers. There are few studies on the adoption of Industry 4.0; however, they focus on specific domains like cloud computing, virtual reality, IoT, etc., and are primarily set in developed countries. This research proposes a multi-stage hybrid analytic approach whereby the research model was tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The SEM results were used as inputs for the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to determine significant predictors for the adoption of Industry 4.0 in Indian manufacturing industries. A comprehensive sample of 350 responses from various Indian manufacturers was collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the factors viz. Software Infrastructure (SI), System Flexibility (SF), Operational Accuracy (OA), and the Technical Capabilities (TC) play a dominant role in the successful adoption intentions of Industry 4.0 in India. Manufacturers from India and other emerging economies will benefit from the findings of this study by concentrating and improving on the dominant adoption factors of Industry 4.0. Concluding, we discuss the study’s results and derive lessons learned for stakeholders, including managers, consultants, policymakers, and regulatory authorities.}

Scholars refer to this shift in becoming creators of technology as computational making, which enables new forms of learning and thinking at the intersection of the physical and the digital. The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making. Our insights highlight a significant need for sharing scholarship and design work on implementing design scaffolds in computational making contexts toward the collective goal of developing a system of design scaffolds to effectively support learners’ thinking across the interdisciplinary, multimodal problem spaces unique to computational making.}

Executive Control (EC), or the ability to regulate attention, affect, and behavior effectively, is one skill that is particularly important for preschool children to develop. EC has been examined for monolingual children as a single construct, and as two related constructs, Cool Executive Control (CEC) and Hot Executive Control (HEC), and is associated with later academic outcomes. The purpose of this study was to extend the EC research to DLL preschoolers, determine if EC is a one or two factor construct in a sample of DLLs, and examine if the construct relates to DLL children’s science achievement. Structural equation modeling was used with a sample of 181 DLL children enrolled in Head Start. In line with previous research on monolingual Head Start children, EC emerged as two distinct latent factors, CEC and HEC. This study also examined the association between concurrent CEC, HEC, and science achievement. CEC was positively associated with DLLs’ science achievement, whereas HEC was not. These findings stress the importance of measuring the two dimensions of DLLs’ EC separately as they differentially relate to science achievement.}

abstract = {It is vital to develop an understanding of students' self-regulatory processes in the domains of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) for the quality delivery of STEM education. However, most studies have followed a variable-centered approach, leaving open the question of how specific SRL (Self-regulated Learning) behaviors group within individual learners. Furthermore, little is known about how students' SRL profiles unfold over time in STEM education, specifically in the context of engineering design. In this study, we examined the change of students’ SRL profiles over time as 108 middle school students designed green buildings in a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We identified three distinct SRL profiles using a longitudinal clustering approach: reflective-oriented, adaptive, and minimally self-regulated learners. In addition, we found that students with different profile memberships differed significantly in their design performance. Specifically, adaptive self-regulated learners outperformed minimally self-regulated learners on design completeness, whereas reflective-oriented self-regulated learners demonstrated higher design efficiency than minimally self-regulated learners. This study provides researchers with both theoretical and methodological insights concerning SRL dynamics. Findings from this research also inform practitioners about the design of adaptive interventions.}

abstract = {Computational Social Science (CSS) involves interdisciplinary fields and exploits computational methods, such as social network analysis as well as computer simulation with the goal of better understanding social phenomena. Agent-Based Models (ABMs) represent an effective research tool for CSS and consist of a class of models, which, aim to emulate or predict complex phenomena through a set of simple rules (i.e., independent actions, interactions and adaptation), performed by multiple agents. The efficiency and scalability of ABMs systems are typically obtained distributing the overall computation on several machines, which interact with each other in order to simulate a specific model. Unfortunately, the design of a distributed simulation model is particularly challenging, especially for domain experts who sporadically are computer scientists and are not used to developing parallel code. D-MASON framework is a distributed version of the MASON library for designing and executing ABMs in a distributed environment ensuring scalability and easiness. D-MASON enable the developer to exploit the computing power of distributed environment in a transparent manner; the developer has to do simple incremental modifications to existing MASON models, without re-designing them. This paper presents several novel features and architectural improvements introduced in the D-MASON framework: an improved space partitioning strategy, a distributed 3D field, a distributed network field, a decentralized communication layer, a novel memory consistency mechanism and the integration to cloud environments. Full documentation, additional tutorials, and other material can be found at https://github.com/isislab-unisa/dmason where the framework can be downloaded.}

COMP 322 teaches students to reason about the behavior of parallel programs, educating them in both the high level abstractions of task-parallel programming as well as the nitty gritty details of working with threads in Java. In this paper, we detail the structure, principles, and experiences of COMP 322, gained from 6 years of teaching parallel programming to second-year undergraduates.

abstract = {Purpose
In recent years, studies have shown that machine learning significantly improves student performance and retention and reduces the risk of student dropout and withdrawal. However, there is a lack of empirical research reviews focusing on the application of machine learning to predict student performance in terms of learning engagement and self-efficacy and exploring their relationships. Hence, this paper conducts a systematic research review on the application of machine learning in higher education from an empirical research perspective.
Design/methodology/approach
This systematic review examines the application of machine learning (ML) in higher education, focusing on predicting student performance, engagement and self-efficacy. The review covers empirical studies from 2016 to 2024, utilizing a PRISMA framework to select 67 relevant articles from major databases.
Findings
The findings show that ML applications are widely researched and published in high-impact journals. The primary functions of ML in these studies include performance prediction, engagement analysis and self-efficacy assessment, employing various ML algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks. Ensemble learning algorithms generally outperform single algorithms regarding accuracy and other evaluation metrics. Common model evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1 score, recall and precision, with newer methods also being explored.
Research limitations/implications
First, empirical research literature was selected from only four renowned electronic journal databases, and the literature was limited to journal articles, with the latest review literature and conference papers published in the form of conference papers also excluded, which led to empirical research not obtaining the latest views of researchers in interdisciplinary fields. Second, this review focused mainly on the analysis of student grade prediction, learning engagement and self-efficacy and did not study students’ risk, dropout rates, retention rates or learning behaviors, which limited the scope of the literature review and the application field of machine learning algorithms. Finally, this article only conducted a systematic review of the application of machine learning algorithms in higher education and did not establish a metadata list or carry out metadata analysis.
Originality/value
The review highlights ML’s potential to enhance personalized education, early intervention and identifying at-risk students. Future research should improve prediction accuracy, explore new algorithms and address current study limitations, particularly the narrow focus on specific outcomes and lack of interdisciplinary perspectives.}

A visual problem-solving environment for programming learning was developed, and 158 college students were conducted in a computational problem-solving activity. The students' activities of designing, composing, and testing solutions were recorded by log data for later analysis. To initially unveil the students' practice and strategies exhibited in the visual problem-solving environment, this study proposed several indicators to quantitatively represent students' computational practice (Sequence, Selection, Simple iteration, Nested iteration, and Testing), computational design (Problem decomposition, Abutment composition, and Nesting composition), and computational performance (Goal attainment and Program size). By the method of cluster analysis, some empirical patterns regarding the students' programming learning with computational problem-solving were identified. Furthermore, comparisons of computational design and computational performance among the different patterns of computational practice were conducted. Considering the relations of students' computational practice to computational design and performance, evidence-based suggestions on the design of supportive programming environments for novice programmers are discussed.}

abstract = {Effects of multiple external representations on teaching and learning have been widely researched; however, relatively little is understood about how different types of representations used for item presentation influence students' performances in computer-based assessments, particularly in those evaluating complex abilities. We designed a multimedia-based assessment for secondary school students that focused on scientific inquiry abilities (i.e., questioning, experimenting, analyzing, and explaining). Through the participation of 1218 students (561 8th graders and 657 11th graders), the balanced arrangement of test booklets, and the use of a generalized partial credit Rasch model, this study aimed at investigating how the modality of representations for item presentation (i.e., dynamic and static) and type of visual information (i.e., context and content) conveyed by the representations affected the item difficulty of the multimedia-based assessment. The results showed that overall items became slightly more difficult for students when the item presentation was static. Also, the interaction effect between modality and grade was significant; when item presentation was changed from dynamic to static, the items became easier to the 8th graders, whereas they were more difficult to the 11th graders. The results suggested that older students might have more cognitive resources to retrieve information from dynamic displays to solve the assessment tasks successfully. Additionally, while all interactions between modality and type of information on items with context visuals were not significant, there were significant interactions on four items with content visuals. A further examination of the items suggested that the tasks and the phenomena involved in the items may influence how modality affected the item difficulties when content visuals were used. These results implied that researchers need to pay special attention on the design of content visuals because they appear to be more influential than context ones to students' performances of science assessments.}

Technology approaches and environmental supports in tandem with these four conceptualizations are articulated. Finally, we discuss the need for teachers to be reflective practitioners and critical enquirers when leveraging technology to promote equitable learning.}

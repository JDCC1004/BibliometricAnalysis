abstract = {The NSF/IEEE-TCPP Parallel and Distributed Computing curriculum guidelines released in 2012 (PDC12) represents an effort to bring more parallel computing concepts into early computer science courses. To date, it has been moderately successful, with the inclusion of some PDC topics in the ACM/IEEE Computer Science curriculum guidelines in 2013 (CS13) and mentions of PDC topics in the Computing Curricula 2020. Additionally, some universities in the U.S. and around the world have started to cover some of these topics in early CS courses. Lack of knowledge of or training in PDC topics among instructors, along with the need to align early CS course content with prescribed learning objectives in the curricula, are often cited as hurdles for adoption in early CS courses. There have been attempts at bringing PDC materials, such as textbook chapters, lecture slides, assignments, and demos to assist instructors of early CS classes. However, the effort required on the part of the instructor to figure out what is relevant to a particular class can be daunting. In this work, we contend that simultaneously classifying pedagogical materials against the CS13 and the PDC12 curriculum guidelines can address some of the challenges faced by instructors and can promote broader adoption of PDC materials in early CS courses. We present CS Materials, a system that can be used to categorize pedagogical materials according to well-known and established curricular guidelines. We show that CS Materials can be leveraged 1) by instructors of early CS courses to find materials that are similar to the one that they use but that also cover PDC topics, and 2) by instructors to check the coverage of topics (and gaps) in a course, and 3) by PDC experts to identify topics for which PDC instructional materials do not exist or are insufficient in order to inform development of additional PDC curricular materials.}

abstract = {Since its launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has attracted huge numbers of players, causing a boom in this game market. Although it is not as popular as before, from time to time we still find crowds of players gathered in some spots where Pokémon appear. Numerous reports have explored this Pokémon phenomenon; however, the exact reasons for its popularity remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the post-adoption behavior of Pokémon Go players and its influential factors in the gaming and tourism industries. The theoretical model of stimulus-organism-response was drawn on to examine the impact of the environmental stimuli (social influence and media influence) on players’ internal organisms, which in turn affect their post-experience responses. Moreover, gender differences were also examined in the hypothetical relationships. A total of 342 valid questionnaires from actual gamers were collected in this study, and data analysis was performed using a structural equation model. The results show that stimulus effects, such as social stimuli (critical mass and social interaction) and media stimuli (content timeliness and media richness), have significant impacts on the players’ internal gamified experience (attachment and conformity), which in turn affect their visit intention to catch creatures at certain attractions and to continue playing Pokémon Go. Further, we have also found that players’ intention to visit Pokémon spots is significantly correlated with their intention to continue playing the game. Findings provide links between gamification and tourism literature. Further theoretical and managerial implications are provided.}

We also evaluated definitions of AIEd from broad and narrow perspectives and clarified the relationship among AIEd, Educational Data Mining, Computer-Based Education, and Learning Analytics. Results indicated that: 1) there was a continuingly increasing interest in and impact of AIEd research; 2) little work had been conducted to bring deep learning technologies into educational contexts; 3) traditional AI technologies, such as natural language processing were commonly adopted in educational contexts, while more advanced techniques were rarely adopted, 4) there was a lack of studies that both employ AI technologies and engage deeply with educational theories. Findings suggested scholars to 1) seek the potential of applying AI in physical classroom settings; 2) spare efforts to recognize detailed entailment relationships between learners’ answers and the desired conceptual understanding within intelligent tutoring systems; 3) pay more attention to the adoption of advanced deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial network and deep neural network; 4) seek the potential of NLP in promoting precision or personalized education; 5) combine biomedical detection and imaging technologies such as electroencephalogram, and target at issues regarding learners’ during the learning process; and 6) closely incorporate the application of AI technologies with educational theories.}

It can refer to “long data,” “wide data,” and both. Big data is of increasing importance in healthcare as well: new methods dedicated to improving data collection, storage, cleaning, processing, and interpretation for medical research continue to be developed. Exploiting new tools and methods to extract meaning from large volume information has the potential to drive real change in clinical practice, and combining this novel data-driven research with the classical hypothesis-driven research will have a large impact on personalized healthcare. However, significant challenges remain. Here we discuss the challenges (and possible solutions) posed to biomedical research by our increasing ability to collect, store, and analyze large datasets. Important challenges include: (1) the need for standardization of data content, format, and clinical definitions, adhering to the FAIR guiding principles; (2) the need for collaborative networks with sharing of both data and expertise, for example through a federated approach; (3) stricter privacy and ethics regulations, in particular the GDPR in the European Union; and (4) a need to reconsider how and when analytic methodology (data science) is taught to medical researchers. Overcoming these challenges will help to make a success of the use of big data in medical and translational research.}

Recently, the notion of the computational empowerment of children has received attention. However, there are still open issues in our understanding and advocacy of it. A related development is the recent interest in the longer-term impacts of our work. Fast and furious participation of children in design sessions is considered inadequate. We should advocate for longer-term trajectories and possibilities for children to make changes that will influence our world. However, the literature is limited in addressing longer-term impacts. This study taps into these two research gaps and showcases how we have addressed the computational empowerment of children in a project tackling bullying at school through critical design and making. In this paper, we examine in detail the children’s designs and their trajectories from the viewpoint of empowerment and impact: whether and how these children’s designs show potential for the empowerment of those bullied and whether and how their designs have had an impact in the realm of digital technology development. Our study has interesting conceptual and methodological implications for CCI research and practice on the computational empowerment of children and on our design research practice.}

Computation and/or symbolic transformations have undoubtedly become one of the dominant trends in modern computer science. In particular, this refers to the execution of the processes of inference of an object with given properties, which is studied with the formation of sets of equalities leading to a target computational model. At the same time, the mathematical theory of computation gets a target equational description, making the process of studying its properties and capabilities more suitable. A model structure based on the method of indexed expressions is developed and applied using the notions of evaluation mapping and assignments. As shown, this may not be considered as generic notion, but derived using the combinators. Thus, the semantics of computation can be derived from the construction of a combinator-as-process. This is the embedding into a system of combinators. A linking system of equalities between combinatorsl is established, which serving as a generic computational model. This allows us to look differently at the previous cognitive ideas of the semantics of computation disabling an evaluation map and assignments and enabling their replacement by a set of equalities between combinators.}

In the present paper, we used a multilevel vector autoregression (VAR) model to examine the temporal dynamics of SRL behaviors as 101 students designed green buildings in Energy3D, a simulation-based computer-aided design (CAD) environment. We examined how different performance groups (i.e., unsuccessful, success-oriented, and mastery-oriented groups) differed in SRL competency, actual SRL behaviors, and SRL networks. We found that the three groups had no significant difference in their perceived SRL competency; however, they differed in SRL behaviors of evaluation. Both the mastery-oriented and success-oriented groups performed more evaluation behaviors than the unsuccessful group. Moreover, the mastery-oriented group showed stronger interaction between SRL behaviors than the success-oriented group and the unsuccessful group. The SRL networks of the three groups shared some similarities, but they were different from each other in general. This study has significant theoretical and methodological implications for the advancement of research in SRL dynamics.}

The rationality of block scale and structure is the guarantee of vitality and humanization quality, facing complex and diverse problems, and the structure reconstruction of urban built-up areas is one of the most difficult challenges in the process of promoting the block system. The traditional planning-construction strategy, as practice in recent years has demonstrated, faces challenges in terms of construction costs, demolition costs, property rights, and jurisprudence. Based on the interaction of the block structure and external space, the study presents a “implant-reconstruction” model. It investigates possibilities of implanting elements and graphically depicts the potential impact of implant-reconstruction using Space Syntax. The findings indicate that the external space implantation mode may actively encourage the construction of small-scale blocks and has benefits in terms of texture respect, low impact, and ease of operation. The simulation and pre-judgment dynamically illustrate the viable path and gives a scientific reference for block alteration.}

A key challenge is knowing how to design and use interactive and intelligent technologies to support interaction in autistic children, given the heterogeneity in levels of social motivation, social development, and interest in digital technologies. To address this challenge, we examined in detail the interaction between digital features and autistic children’s joint engagement in a real-world setting, exploring the impact of tangible constraints in fostering social interaction. The current study observed autistic children (aged between 12 and 15 years) playing with a digital robotic toy and a non-digital counterpart, and measured social attention and engagement during free play. The results showed that increased and higher levels of joint attention when children had to share a toy between them, on both digital and non-digital interfaces. We found that autistic children individually vary in their propensity to engage in social interactions, as well as their responses to digital features. This work contributes to a growing area of evidence that tangible and smart technologies can create social opportunities for autistic children.}

In this perspective, perceived usability of the online learning platforms that are currently being used is an important aspect, especially due to the absence of any physical classes. In this work Microsoft Teams is used as the reference platform for which the perceived usability is evaluated. For the evaluation purpose a dual strategy is followed by using the System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) based approach, and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which is an Information Systems (IS) based approach. Although both these instruments are popular in their respective domains, yet they have not been considered simultaneously in one work for the purpose of usability evaluation. By doing so, this work attempts to streamline and unify the process of usability evaluation. Results that are obtained from a large-scale survey of university students show the similarity and equivalency between the two methodologies, with the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) construct of TAM having greater similarity with SUS. Moreover, this work also considers the digital-divide aspect (mobile vs. web environment) that is prevalent particularly in developing countries like India, and whether it has any effect on the perceived usability. Results show that the consumption platform does not have any effect on the usability aspect.}

Several intriguing findings have been identified: (i) the insufficient grounding in usability/UX frameworks indicates that there seems a disconnection between the HCI and technology-enhanced learning community; (ii) a lack of innovative AR-specific usability/UX evaluation methods and the continuing reliance on questionnaire may hamper the advances of AREAs; (iii) the learner age seems not a significant factor in determining the perceived usability and UX or the learning effect of AREAs; (iv) a limited number of studies at home suggests the missed opportunity of mobilizing parents to support children to deploy AREAs in different settings; (v) the number of AREAs for children with special needs remains disappointedly low; (vi) the threat of predatory journals to the quality of bibliometric sources amplifies the need for a robust approach to the quality assessment for SLR and transparency of interim results. Implications of these issues for future research and practice on AREAs are drawn.}

abstract = {Human activities have extensively altered landscapes throughout the world and further changes are expected in the future. Anthropogenic impacts such as land use change, groundwater extraction and dam construction, along with the effects of climate change, interact with natural factors including soil weathering and erosion. Together, these processes create a constantly shifting, dynamic terrestrial environment that violates the assumption of stationarity commonly applied in hydrology. Consequently, hydrologists need to rethink both statistical and calibrated models to account for complex environmental processes. We review the literature on human-landscape-hydrological interactions to identify processes and feedbacks that influence water balances. Most of the papers covered consider only a few of these processes at a time and focus on structural attributes of the interactions rather than the short and long-term dynamics. We identify challenges in representing the scale-dependence, environmental connectivity and human-water interactions that characterize complex, dynamic landscapes. A synthesis of the findings posits connections between different landscape changes, as well as the associated timescales and level of certainty. A case study explores how different processes could combine to drive long-term shifts in catchment behavior. Recognizing that some important questions remain unaddressed by traditional approaches, we suggest the concept of ‘big laboratories’ in which multifaceted experiments are conducted in the environment by artificially inducing landscape change. These experiments would be accompanied by mechanistic modeling to both untangle experimental results and improve the theoretical basis of environmental models. An ambitious program of physical and virtual experimentation is needed to progress hydrologic prediction for dynamic landscapes.
Plain language summary
The Earth’s surface is constantly changing due to human-driven and natural processes. Shifts may be driven by humans directly (e.g. via land use change) or indirectly (e.g. by driving climate change that causes shifts in ecological communities). Other changes are natural, such as certain soil processes that lead to shifts in texture and properties over time. In many places, landscape change is now occurring at unprecedented rates. This impacts the water cycle, creating a need for models that are robust under changing conditions. Our paper synthesizes a wide range of literature on key aspects of landscape change that have wide-ranging implications for hydrology. We focus on the impacts of processes at different spatial and temporal scales, along with feedbacks between various environmental and anthropogenic shifts. We discuss connections between different landscape changes and the timescales over which they each affect the water cycle. A case study is presented to highlight the potential for cascading landscape disturbances that could alter long-term catchment response. Recognizing limitations in traditional data collection and modeling, we introduce the concept of ‘big laboratories’ to conduct environmental experiments under landscape change, providing an avenue for addressing the complex questions around hydrology in a changing world.}

abstract = {Studies associated with critical analyses of entrepreneurship education (EE) highlight the predominance of literatures that focus closely on the positive aspects of entrepreneurship. This can lead to cognitive bias, resulting in students developing more favorable and even enthusiastic perceptions of entrepreneurial action. To reduce this information asymmetry, the intention of this study was to identify and classify the diversity of negative aspects resulting from unsuccessful entrepreneurial action. To this end, we applied the content analysis technique to the transcripts of interviews with former entrepreneurs and stakeholders associated with entrepreneurial action, in addition to the texts of articles from important journals of Entrepreneurship and Small Business identified through a scope literature review. The findings indicate that unsuccessful entrepreneurial action can result in several negative effects for the entrepreneur, both subjectively (psychological and social aspects - dark side) and objectively (material aspects - downside). The study also identified several negative effects that impact other individuals and society (destructive side). The literature review and interaction with former entrepreneurs and professionals who work with entrepreneurs showed 38 negative aspects in the three dimensions known as “Triple Ds” (dark, destructive and downside). A taxonomy tree was developed that integrates these different types and subtypes, as well as software (https://thetripleds.com/) that makes these contents available. These resources can be used by EE professors, managers and technicians of agencies that support entrepreneurs to raise the awareness of potential entrepreneurs regarding the various risks associated with entrepreneurial action.}

abstract = {Our main models of computation (the Turing Machine and the RAM) and most modern computer architectures make fundamental assumptions about which primitive operations are realizable on a physical computing device. The consensus is that these primitive operations include logical operations like conjunction, disjunction and negation, as well as reading and writing to a large collection of memory locations. This perspective conforms to a macro-level view of physics and indeed these operations are realizable using macro-level devices involving thousands of electrons. This point of view is however incompatible with computation realized using quantum devices or analyzed using elementary thermodynamics as both these fundamental physical theories imply that information is a conserved quantity of physical processes and hence of primitive computational operations. Our aim is to redevelop foundational computational models in a way that embraces the principle of conservation of information. We first define what information is and what its conservation means in a computational setting. We emphasize the idea that computations must be reversible transformations on data. One can think of data as modeled using topological spaces and programs as modeled by reversible deformations of these spaces. We then illustrate this idea using three notions of data and their associated reversible computational models. The first instance only assumes unstructured finite data, i.e., discrete topological spaces. The corresponding notion of reversible computation is that of permutations. We show how this simple model subsumes conventional computations on finite sets. We then consider a modern structured notion of data based on the Curry–Howard correspondence between logic and type theory. We develop the corresponding notion of reversible deformations using a sound and complete programming language for witnessing type isomorphisms and proof terms for commutative semirings. We then “move up a level” to examine spaces that treat programs as data, which is a crucial notion for any universal model of computation. To derive the corresponding notion of reversible programs between programs, i.e., reversible program equivalences, we look at the “higher dimensional” analog to commutative semirings: symmetric rig groupoids. The coherence laws for these groupoids turn out to be exactly the sound and complete reversible program equivalences we seek. We conclude with some possible generalizations inspired by homotopy type theory and survey several open directions for further research.}

This article applies a systematic review methodology in line with the PRISMA protocol and analyzes current social and technological challenges based on 105 articles published between 2000 and 2019. The review identifies social challenges that facilitate personalization for external factors and teaching methods, stimulate learner-oriented content, instructor, peer, and technology forms of engagement, and boost interactivity depending on the willingness of learners and instructors. The review also finds technological challenges that concern designing learning environments and integrating intelligent systems, analytical tools and analysis, system models and ontology, and mobile and social media applications. The review suggests areas for future research involving smart classroom design for continuity and consistency, quality attributes of smart classrooms, efficiency and sustainability of smart classroom infrastructure, and the development of a smart classroom modelling language.}

The competent use of digital systems (esp. information and communication technologies [ICT]) has thus become an essential skill. Despite longstanding research on human-technology interaction and diverse theoretical approaches describing competences for interacting with digital systems, research still offers mixed results regarding the structure of digital competences. Self-efficacy is described as one of the most critical determinants of competent digital system use, and various self-report scales for assessing digital self-efficacy have been suggested. Yet, these scales largely differ in their proposed specificity, structure, validation, and timeliness. The present study aims at providing a systematic overview and comparison of existing measures of digital self-efficacy (DSE) to current theoretical digital competence frameworks. Further, we present a newly developed scale that assesses digital self-efficacy in heterogeneous adult populations, theoretically founded in the DigComp 2.1 and social-cognition theory. The factorial structure of the DSE scale is assessed to investigate multidimensionality. Further, the scale is validated considering the nomological network (actual ICT use, technophobia). Implications for research and practice are discussed.}

Theoretically, the affective domain of coding is in its infancy, and very few studies have set out to identify the determinants of coding interest and self-efficacy. This study explored how mathematics interest and self-efficacy, as two important mathematics-related factors, influenced coding interest and self-efficacy. Employing a quantitative cross-sectional survey design, 605 students from two public senior high schools in two big cities in China were investigated. A two-step structural equation modeling approach was adopted to analyze the data. Findings showed that mathematics interest, directly and indirectly, influenced coding interest significantly. In addition, coding self-efficacy was indirectly impacted by mathematics interest and coding interest was indirectly impacted by mathematics self-efficacy significantly. Most importantly, our model has proved to be powerful in explaining coding interest. This study contributes to the theoretical and practical understanding of the relationship between mathematics and coding attitudes, seldom explored in senior high school settings.}

In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using digital technologies to promote more participatory forms of democracy. While there are numerous potential benefits to using digital tools to enhance democracy, significant challenges must be addressed. It is essential to ensure that digital technologies are used in an accessible, equitable, and fair manner rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances. This paper investigates how digital tools can be used to help design more democratic societies by investigating three key research areas: (1) the role of digital technologies for facilitating civic engagement in collective decision-making; (2) the use of digital tools to improve transparency and accountability in governance; and (3) the potential for digital technologies to enable the formation of more inclusive and representative democracies. We argue that more research on how digital technologies can be used to support democracy upgrade is needed. Along these lines, we lay out a research agenda for the future.}

abstract = {Digital technology has brought new opportunities for language education. Multimodal literacy refers to the ability to read, watch, understand, respond to, and generate multimodal texts. Multimodality, promoted by scholars, generates meaning in multiple modes. Hence, digital storytelling (DST) presented with multimodal content has been extensively applied in second language instruction. However, traditional DST is mostly presented in videos with one-way communication; it lacks two-way communication with the audience and is only regarded as a learning method for knowledge acquisition. As a result, the present study proposed a robot-based DST (robot-DST) approach to facilitate the interaction in the DST process and to enhance students' engagement. In order to evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in an EFL course at a senior high school. Two classes of 11th graders participated in the experiment. One class with 40 students was the experimental group adopting the robot-DST approach, while the other class with 40 students was the control group adopting the conventional animation-based DST (CA-DST) approach. The results showed that the robot-DST approach could significantly reduce students' communication apprehension, as well as enhance their English speaking ability, storytelling ability, narrative engagement, and communication tendency. The findings show that using robots in the context of digital storytelling design has great potential for promoting learners’ language learning performances. Accordingly, in-depth discussion and suggestions for future research are provided for researchers and school teachers who intend to use robots in educational settings.}

abstract = {Context:
Model-driven approaches are increasingly used in different domains, such as education, finance and app development, in order to involve non-developers in the software development process. Such tools are hugely dependent on visual elements and thus might not be accessible for users with specific challenges, e.g., visual impairments.
Objectives:
To locate and analyse existing literature on the accessibility of low-code approaches, their strengths and weaknesses and key directions for future research.
Methods:
We carried out a systematic literature review and searched through five leading databases for primary studies. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods for data synthesis.
Results:
After reviewing and filtering 918 located studies, and conducting both backward and forward snowballing, we identified 38 primary studies that were included in our analysis. We found most papers focusing on accessibility of visual languages and block-based programming.
Conclusion:
Limited work has been done on improving low code programming environment accessibility. The findings of this systematic literature review will assist researchers and developers in understanding the accessibility issues in low-code approaches and what has been done so far to develop accessible approaches.}

Its mission is to educate and train ethical, critical, and humanistic forensic scientists capable of conducting inquiries that meet scientific quality standards and assist the justice system in firmly linking legal rulings to the available evidence. At the time, it was the first such program in the country, and the contributions that interdisciplinary forensic scientists could make to criminal investigations were largely unknown among forensic and legal practitioners. During its existence, providing an interdisciplinary, competence-based education to students has been one of the main challenges. To overcome it, teaching and assessment approaches—centered on the achievement of specifically forensic competencies as learning outcomes and the integration of forensic disciplines towards the resolution of simulated cases—have been devised to help develop the professional skill set expected of graduates. The COVID-19 pandemic led to adapting these approaches to distance or hybrid modes of learning, increasing their versatility and enriching the pedagogic repertoire of the FSUP. Currently, the main impact of the program lies in the successful incorporation of some of its graduates to agencies belonging to or related to the criminal justice system, such as the National Prosecutor’s Office, the Commission for Truth and Justice for the Ayotzinapa Case, and the National Commission for the Search of Missing and Disappeared Persons, among others.}

The proliferation of sensor technology has driven the field of learning technology towards the development of tools and methods that may benefit from the produced Multi-Modal Data (MMD). Such data can be used to uncover cognitive, affective and physiological processes during learning activities. Combining MMD with more traditionally exercised assessment tools, such as video content analysis, provides a more holistic understanding of children’s learning experiences and has the potential to enable the design of educational technologies capable of harmonising children’s cognitive, affective and physiological processes, while promoting appropriately balanced play and problem-solving efforts. However, the use of an MMD mixed methods approach that combines qualitative and MMD data to understand children’s behaviours during engagement with MBLT is rather unexplored. We present an in-situ study where 26 children, ages 10–12, solved a motion-based sorting task for learning geometry. We continuously and unobtrusively monitored children’s learning experiences using MMD collection via eye-trackers, wristbands, Kinect joint tracking, and a web camera. We devised SP3, a novel observational scheme that can be used to understand children’s solo interactions with MBLT, and applied it to identify and extract children’s evoked play and problem-solving behaviour. Collective analysis of the MMD and video codes provided explanations of children’s task performance through consideration of their holistic learning experience. Lastly, we applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between various MMD measurements and children’s play and problem-solving behaviours. This research sheds light on the opportunities offered in the confluence of video coding (a traditional method in learning sciences) and MMD (an emerging method that leverages sensors proliferation) for investigating children’s behaviour with MBLT.}

abstract = {With the large-scale promotion of new energy vehicles, the demand for power batteries such as the lithium-ion type has increased. Its service lifespan is closely related to the service condition. The important embodiment of the service condition is the battery state of charge, which can reflect its residual capacity. Through accurate residual capacity, the battery application strategy can be planned to realize the battery operation of the best condition. The long service lifespan can be realized by adjusting the voltage and current. Therefore, real-time accurate state estimation has a significant effect on battery management. The extended Kalman filtering algorithm is introduced to estimate the state value under complex working conditions. The overview of the state-of-charge estimation is first conducted. After that, the equivalent modeling construction method is explored. The coordinate transformation treatment is implemented in the binary iterative calculation algorithm, according to which the algorithm is implemented. In the extended calculation process, the iterative prediction and correction strategies are introduced into the test. Consequently, the pulse-power characteristic test is conducted to obtain the estimation features, considering a thermal influencing effect, a time-varying current condition, and a complex current rate verification.}

Everyone knows that excessive exposure to radiation can cause severe damage to living things, but high radiation levels can also cause radiation damage to other objects, especially electronics. Ionizing radiation in particular, including directly ionizing radiation such as alpha and beta particles and indirectly ionizing radiation such as gamma rays and neutron radiation, is profoundly damaging to the semiconductors that make up the backbone of all modern electronics. Just one charged particle can interfere with thousands of electrons, causing signal noise, disrupting digital circuits, and even causing permanent physical radiation damage. Radiation hardening involves designing radiation-tolerant electronics and components that are tolerant of the massive levels of ionizing radiation, such as cosmic outer space radiation, X-ray radiation in medical or security environments, and high energy radiation within nuclear power plants. In order to test these components and determine whether they are sufficiently hardened, radiation-hardened electronics manufacturers perform rigorous testing as part of their product manufacturing processes. Components which pass these tests go into production and can be described as “radiation-hardened”; components that do not go back to design.}

Extensive data are collected on all aspects of how customers interact or experience the products or services. Research has shown the importance of the “peak-end” rule in service design; that is, providing a customer with good “peak” service levels and “ending” the service experience with high quality can enhance customer satisfaction and build loyalty. However, previous studies have examined this phenomenon only in contexts with unidimensional service levels. We introduce peak cubes, which enable service designers and scholars to pinpoint prominent service levels in multidimensional service experience profiles—thereby extending current research on behavioral economics and service design to more general settings. Results indicate the potential of multidimensional peak-end models to better predict customer satisfaction in various service scenarios. Using Shapley values in coalitional game theory, the resulting models can also inform service designers about the quality dimensions that are critical from the perspective of multidimensional peak-end heuristic and customer satisfaction. Our research contributions and proposed methodology will enhance decision support systems with multidimensional capabilities and have applications to fields as diverse as service operations and healthcare.}

When we examine what and how our system teaches young designers, we discover that the most valuable elements of the designer’s perspective and process are seldom taught. Instead, some designers grow beyond their education through their experience working in industry, essentially learning by accident. Many design programs still maintain an insular perspective and an inefficient mechanism of tacit knowledge transfer. Meanwhile, skills for developing creative solutions to complex problems are increasingly essential. Organizations are starting to recognize that designers bring something special to this type of work, a rational belief based upon numerous studies that link commercial success to a design-driven approach. So, what are we to do? Other learned professions such as medicine, law, and business provide excellent advice and guidance embedded within their own histories of professionalization. In this article, we borrow from their experiences to recommend a course of action for design. It will not be easy: it will require a study group to make recommendations for a roster of design and educational practices that schools can use to build a curriculum that matches their goals and abilities. And then it will require a conscious effort to bootstrap the design profession toward both a robust practitioner community and an effective professoriate, capable together of fully realizing the value of design in the 21st century. In this article, we lay out that path.}

A systematic search of 11 databases identified a total of 350 unique items that contain “digital citizenship” in the title or keywords published by December 2018, with the majority published after 2010. Of these, 114 were peer-reviewed journal articles published in a wide range of discipline-specific venues, more than half of which were education-related. In-depth analyses show that each of the dominant conceptualizations of DC has been adopted by different disciplines, albeit with different popularities in adoption. Findings also revealed widely shared stakeholder concerns and research foci in DC research across the disciplines. However, there is a stark lack of empirical research on the young children, and an absence of commonly deployed research instruments in DC-related research. The present integrative review implicates the need for interdisciplinary collaboration for significant advances in DC research to address issues in policy and practice.}

A cross-sectional, descriptive, and quantitative research was conducted with 252 students from a public university in Mexico. Transversal skills, socioformative project-based practices, learning strategies, and the relevance of online activities were assessed using validated rubrics. The results indicated a low level of development in three transversal skills: research, entrepreneurship, and English, with the latter being the poorest rated. Critical and creative thinking exhibited the highest level of development. In the didactic component, socioformative project-based pedagogical practices and learning strategies showed acceptable levels. Students expressed satisfaction with complementary online activities, showing a preference for interactive videos and short videos under 4 min. Regression analysis and structural equations were used to examine the relationships between various factors. Results demonstrated that socioformative project-based pedagogical practices, learning strategies, and online education positively correlated with the development of transversal skills. Furthermore, a higher level of transversal skills was associated with better academic averages among students. Socioformative project-based pedagogical practices also correlated with academic performance through transversal skills. The study concludes that integrating online activities into on-campus programs, based on the socioformative pedagogical model, can enhance the development of transversal skills and improve academic performance. Further research into the implementation of this educational model and its long-term impact on university education and professional success is recommended.}

In this paper, we report on the findings of employing a multimodal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methodology to investigate the temporal learning processes of two types of learners that have learning gains and a type that does not have learning gains in an open-ended collaborative learning activity. Considering log data, speech behavior, affective states and gaze patterns, we find that all learners start from a similar state of non-productivity, but once out of it they are unlikely to fall back into that state, especially in the case of the learners that have learning gains. Those who have learning gains shift between two problem solving strategies, each characterized by both exploratory and reflective actions, as well as demonstrate speech and gaze patterns associated with these strategies, that differ from those who don't have learning gains. Further, the teams that have learning gains also differ between themselves in the manner in which they employ the problem solving strategies over the interaction, as well as in the manner they express negative emotions while exhibiting a particular strategy. These outcomes contribute to understanding the multiple pathways of learning in an open-ended collaborative learning environment, and provide actionable insights for designing effective interventions.}

To enrich the anti-phishing efforts, we capitalise on concepts from graph theories, and propose a set of novel graph features to improve the phishing detection accuracy. The initial phase of the proposed technique involved the extraction of hyperlinks in the webpage under scrutiny and fetching the corresponding neighbourhood webpages. During this process, the page linking data were collected, and used to construct a web graph which models the overall hyperlink and network structure of the webpage. From the web graph, graph measures were computed and extracted as graph features to derive a classifier for detecting phishing webpages. Experimental results show that the proposed graph features achieve an improved overall accuracy of 97.8% when C4.5 was utilised as classifier, outperforming the existing conventional features derived from the same data samples. Unlike conventional features, the proposed graph features leverage inherent phishing patterns that are only visible at a higher level of abstraction, thus making it robust and difficult to be evaded by direct manipulations on the webpage contents. Our proposed graph-based technique also shows promising results when benchmarked against a prominent phishing detection technique. Hence, the proposed technique is an important contribution to the existing anti-phishing research towards improving the detection performance.}

abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) continues to show its impact in education. While systematic review and meta-analysis studies have synthesized the evidence of this impact, most of them did not differentiate how AR may foster various learning outcomes to different degrees. In this study, 134 (quasi-)experimental studies on augmented reality (AR) in education from 2012 to 2021 were reviewed to discern the impact of AR on three levels of learning outcomes, namely response, knowledge and skill, and performance. The 134 studies are the data of this study for meta-analysis, which were obtained following the procedure of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis. Moreover, meta-regression was employed to investigate important factors relating to the variation of the impact, including educational level, subject area, treatment duration, and AR affordance. Findings from the meta-analysis suggest that AR technology has benefited all three learning outcomes, with a larger mean effect size on the outcome of performance. Furthermore, the meta-regression results indicate treatment duration as a significant factor likely relating to the variation in the impact of AR in education. Moreover, AR used to support the learning of languages or social studies is likely associated with higher positive learner responses such as learning motivation or attitude than AR used for science learning. The meta-regression result indicated that use of 3-D visualization in AR needs to be carefully designed and evaluated. The implications of using AR to support learning, the design of AR learning environments, and the future direction of research are discussed.}

This paper presents a framework of employee skills and competencies useful for developing occupational profiles for employees of companies transitioning towards Industry 4.0. The paper consists of a discussion of the theoretical and practical parts of case studies. The theoretical portion was created on the basis of a review of scientific literature and research studies regarding the competencies and skills of employees in the ongoing fourth industrial revolution. This part focuses on the skills profile of an Industry 4.0 employee and an Operator 4.0 (O4.0) from a creativity and innovativeness point of view. The link between the theoretical part and the case study analysis was a general framework for building the competencies and skills of the steelworker in the emerging fourth industrial revolution. The case study analysis covered the framework of competencies and skills of a metallurgist in smart manufacturing built into the organization of steel mills. Recruitment offers of a steel company implementing smart manufacturing (SM) projects and educational programmes of technical universities in the field of metallurgy were analysed. The aim of the study was to develop a framework for the profile of an employee working in an innovative company transforming to I4.0. The publication posed the following research questions (purposes/hypotheses): P1. To what extent do Polish companies in the metallurgical sector pay attention to creativity and innovation issues when looking for employees? P2. To what extent do the profile (portfolio) of metallurgy graduates of Polish technical universities turn their attention to the issues related to creativity and innovation?}

Currently, Neural Nets, especially as so-called “Deep Learning” nets, dominate what is popularly called “Artificial Intelligence”, but to many critics they seem to be little more than powerful data-analytic tools inspired by some of the more basic functions and regions of the human brain such as those involved in early processes in biological vision, classification, and categorization. The deeper nature of human intelligence as the term is normally meant, including relating to consciousness, has been the domain of philosophers, psychologists, and some neuroscientists. Now, attention is turning to neuronal mechanisms in humans and simpler organisms as a basis of a truer AI with far greater potential. Arguably, the approach required should be rooted in information theory and algorithmic science. But as discussed in this paper, caution is required: “just any old information” might not do. The information might need to be of a particular dynamical and actioning nature, and that might significantly impact the kind of computation and computer hardware required. Overall, however, the authors do not favor emergent properties such as those based on complexity and quantum effects. Despite the possible difficulties, such studies could, in return, have substantial benefits for biology and medicine beyond the computational tools that they produce to serve those disciplines.}

Although this trend is currently limited to middle school, high school, and higher education, prior research suggests that children 5 years and older, may yield long-term gains from exploring developmentally-appropriate concepts from novel STEM fields. Although there is little research on educational technologies or resources to support young children’s curiosity and learning in this novel domain, some research suggests that young children may already be forming preconceptions about genetics and biology (e.g., from popular media). Tangible technologies, which provide children qualitatively new, developmentally appropriate ways to engage with ideas and techniques, have been shown to support children’s engagement with foundational ideas relevant to biodesign, including the engineering design process. By applying developmentally appropriate constraints to our technology development (e.g., through frameworks such as the Positive Technological Development), the research team developed and evaluated a novel tangible technology called CRISPEE to introduce young children to concepts of biology and engineering. This article describes an experimental pilot study to investigate (1) how young children interact with the CRISPEE technological prototype, and (2) what prior knowledge the average child might bring to an educational biodesign activity. Implications for ongoing technology development and developmentally appropriate learning goals are discussed.}

Various software solutions can produce numerous visualizations of the same data set. However, data visualization encompasses a wide range of visual configurations that depend on factors such as the type of data being displayed, the different displays (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs, and pie charts), the visual components used to represent the data (e.g., lines, dots, and bars), and the specific visual attributes of those components (e.g., color, shape, size, and length). A similar problem arises when designing data tables, where the dimensionality of the data and its complexity influence the choice of the most appropriate structure (e.g., unidirectional, bidirectional). Often, this broad spectrum of configurations requires a visualization expert who knows which techniques are best for which type of data source and what is to be conveyed. Typically, researchers and developers lack knowledge of data visualization best practices and must learn the design principles that enable effective communication and the technical details of the specific software tool they use to generate visualizations. This paper proposes a software product line approach to model and realize the variability of the visualization design process, using feature models to encode knowledge about design best practices in graphs and charts. Our approach involves solving visualization design variability through a stepwise configuration process and evaluating the proposal for a specific software visualization tool. Our solution facilitates effective communication of quantitative results by helping researchers and developers select and generate the most effective visualizations for each case. This approach opens up new opportunities for research at the intersection of data visualization and variability.}

Additionally, these courses would benefit from embedded 21st century skills, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and lifelong learning behaviors, but such skills are often neglected in course design even though the education and workforce literature are clear about their importance for future careers. The breadth and complexity in course design necessary to incorporate all of these components create a challenge for instructors and students. In this interpretive study, we investigate student experiences and perceived outcomes in a technology-mediated graduate-level CS&E course designed to address the difficulties associated with this wide range of disciplinary topics and professional skills. Our course design is based on reflective practice and principles of metacognition, and applies elements such as a flipped classroom, student journals, and reflective writing exercises; these design goals directly support students’ metacognition and foster self-regulated learning behaviors that, in turn, develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. We evaluate this design using student reflective writing and surveys. Results indicate reflective writing activities in course design helped develop students’ metacognitive awareness, self-regulated learning behaviors, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills. This course design can serve as a template for others teaching technology-mediated courses in CS&E and related areas, and aiming to develop students’ 21st century professional skills.}

abstract = {Background
Digital behavioral interventions have become increasingly popular for their ability to support patient diagnosis and treatment, chronic disease self-management, behavior change, and adherence to recommended care. However, digital intervention development is impeded by challenges such as limited technical skills, limited access to developers, and cost. The purpose of this study is to elicit in-depth qualitative feedback from intervention developers who have interest in digital behavioral interventions but lack programming skills regarding the barriers they experience and key considerations in the design and implementation of digital interventions.
Objective
This study aims to understand barriers in the design and implementation of digital behavioral interventions, as well as to identify key considerations for researchers who are developing these interventions.
Methods
We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 18 researchers who had experience either designing (but not coding) digital behavioral interventions or running research studies with them. Participants were a convenience sample of users of the Computerized Intervention Authoring System platform, an existing no-code development platform for building digital intervention content, and were recruited through either direct email solicitation or snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted and recorded over videoconference between February and April 2020. Recordings from interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed by multiple coders.
Results
Interviews were completed with 18 participants and lasted between 24 and 65 (mean 46.9, SD 11.3) minutes. Interviewees were predominantly female (17/18, 94%) and represented different job roles, ranging from researcher to project/study staff. Three key barriers in the development of digital behavior interventions were identified during interviews: lack of cross-disciplinary understanding; variability in recipients’ technology access, infrastructure, and literacy; and the idea that evidence-based in-person interactions do not translate directly to digital interactions. Interviewees identified several key considerations that interventionists learned to prioritize, which have the potential to overcome these barriers and lead to successful interventions.
Conclusions
Barriers in the development of digital behavioral interventions are often created by a lack of cross-disciplinary understanding, which can lead to difficulties conceptualizing interventions, unrealistic expectations in terms of cost, and confusion about the development process. Moreover, concerns about research study participant characteristics and access to technology, as well as the translation of in-person interventions to digital, are apparent. Appropriate training in how to work with software development teams may help future digital behavior intervention creators overcome these barriers and may lead to new, exciting innovations in this space.}

This study reviews a sample from world-leading countries National Cybersecurity Strategic Plans (NCSPs) and analyzes the associated existing cybersecurity education and training improvement initiatives. Furthermore, a proposal to adopt the Goal-Question-Outcomes(GQO)+Strategies paradigm into cybersecurity education and training programs curricula improvement to national cybersecurity strategic goals is presented. The proposal maps cybersecurity strategic goals to cybersecurity skills and competencies using the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework. The newly proposed cybersecurity education and training programs’ curricula learning outcomes were generated from the GQO+Strategies paradigm based on the three major cybersecurity strategic goals: Development of secure digital and information technology infrastructure and services, defending from sophisticated cyber threats, and enrichment of individuals’ cybersecurity maturity and awareness. It is highly recommended that cybersecurity university program administrators utilize the proposed GQO+Strategies to align their program’s curriculum to NCSP. Hence, closing the gap that exists with the relevant skills and sustain national cybersecurity workforces.}

Moving forward, adopting Industry 4.0 is an evident requirement for manufacturers to remain competitive. Currently, in the early stages of adoption in most industries and countries, there is an evident lack of foundational Industry 4.0 knowledge among decision-makers. There are few studies on the adoption of Industry 4.0; however, they focus on specific domains like cloud computing, virtual reality, IoT, etc., and are primarily set in developed countries. This research proposes a multi-stage hybrid analytic approach whereby the research model was tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The SEM results were used as inputs for the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to determine significant predictors for the adoption of Industry 4.0 in Indian manufacturing industries. A comprehensive sample of 350 responses from various Indian manufacturers was collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the factors viz. Software Infrastructure (SI), System Flexibility (SF), Operational Accuracy (OA), and the Technical Capabilities (TC) play a dominant role in the successful adoption intentions of Industry 4.0 in India. Manufacturers from India and other emerging economies will benefit from the findings of this study by concentrating and improving on the dominant adoption factors of Industry 4.0. Concluding, we discuss the study’s results and derive lessons learned for stakeholders, including managers, consultants, policymakers, and regulatory authorities.}

Hiding browsing activity is essential for Internet users to increase their privacy. Only Tor users should know the website they are browsing. However, an attacker can utilise the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack to identify webpages browsed by Tor users. WF is a significant threat to Internet users' privacy as Tor should conceal the browsed webpages' information. Existing WF studies focused on the investigation to improve the identification capabilities, overlooking the systematic discussion and assessment of existing techniques. In addition, existing surveys and analyses reviewed insufficient variation of WF on Tor techniques. Therefore, this survey paper aims to provide a systematic and thorough review of various WF on Tor techniques. First, we discuss WF on Tor techniques in five primary aspects: threat model, victim target, website realm, traffic feature, and traffic classifier. We analyse and classify the reviewed studies on each WF aspect. The classification facilitates in-depth understanding and comparison between WF on Tor techniques. Furthermore, this paper investigates nine assumptions exercised in WF on Tor: closed-world, sequential browsing, isolated traffic, replicability, traffic parsing, passive webpage, disabled cache, static content, and single webpage. These assumptions limit the WF on Tor's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our analysis and classification indicate that most WF on Tor studies apply these assumptions despite being only suitable in controlled environments or laboratory experiments. In addition, most reviewed studies often lack transparency on the assumptions exercised in their studies, risking misunderstanding the WF on Tor techniques' actual practicality. At the end of this survey, we present WF on Tor taxonomy and highlight 21 WF on Tor research's limitations and gaps with plausible recommendations. We also discuss the WF on Tor studies' contribution category and development phase.}

EC has been examined for monolingual children as a single construct, and as two related constructs, Cool Executive Control (CEC) and Hot Executive Control (HEC), and is associated with later academic outcomes. The purpose of this study was to extend the EC research to DLL preschoolers, determine if EC is a one or two factor construct in a sample of DLLs, and examine if the construct relates to DLL children’s science achievement. Structural equation modeling was used with a sample of 181 DLL children enrolled in Head Start. In line with previous research on monolingual Head Start children, EC emerged as two distinct latent factors, CEC and HEC. This study also examined the association between concurrent CEC, HEC, and science achievement. CEC was positively associated with DLLs’ science achievement, whereas HEC was not. These findings stress the importance of measuring the two dimensions of DLLs’ EC separately as they differentially relate to science achievement.}

This paper focuses on the development of dynamic demand for AI talents and proposes a strategic planning framework for educational cooperation in the GBA. We use the research idea of common attributes and key chain clustering-factor association selection-analysis of the driving force and subordination among factors-the key characteristics of AI talents. Using collinear analysis of citations and grounded theory methods, an operational definition of the influencing factors of AI talent literacy characteristics is constructed. Using the Interpretative Structural Modeling(ISM) and MICMAC (Matrice d’Impacts Croises-Multipication Applique A Classement), analyze and identify the driving force and subordination of the influencing factors of key traits of talents, and present the combined effect of multi-level factors of key traits of talents. Combined with the educational differences and complementary advantages in the GBA, five strategies and seven implementation suggestions for the GBA's AI talent education cooperation plan are formulated to establish a collaborative ecosystem that promotes the growth and integration of AI in the GBA.}

It is crucial to acquire the so-called competencies of the future as the basis for implementing the idea of Industry 4.0. The purpose of the article is to present the development of human potential in an organization against the background of other detailed sustainable HRM principles, to be followed by confronting the theory and the research results on the development of future competencies referring to industrial engineers in Poland as the professional group responsible for implementing the idea of cleaner production and Industry 4.0. The Author analyzed the results of three research projects based on the survey method and representative data from Eurostat and Statistics Poland. The conducted research shows that industrial companies in Poland have more of a short-sighted perspective when it comes to developing the potential of their engineers. The HR development practices focusing only on current needs are not in line with the SHRM principles of a long-term perspective and flexibility. There is also a visible lack of employee participation in the process of making training-related decisions, which is another principle of sustainable HRM. In addition, environmental sustainability remains a neglected area of knowledge in terms of training, and the cooperation with external educational institutions is low. It results in certain implications for HR managers and educational institutions. The article also presents directions for further research.}

abstract = {Teachers in England are required to ensure that learners from the age of five are taught about algorithms and program design. Yet, there is evidence that despite teachers reporting that design is important, they are not converting this into classroom practice. This paper describes a survey study, in which we explored teachers’ difficulties in using design. We surveyed 207 teachers asking them free-text questions on their use of design in teaching programming and their views of pupils’ responses to using design. In the survey, we also investigated teachers’ understanding of the term algorithm, an essential concept which may be a contributing factor in their difficulties with design. We provide underpinning data on the difficulties of using design that teachers of pupils aged from 5 to 11 years old (Grades K to 5) have in teaching programming. Difficulties with design identified include pupil resistance, a lack of time, a lack of pupil and teacher expertise, conflicting pedagogical choices and a general confusion over what an algorithm is. There were statistically significant differences in selection of the term ‘algorithm’ to describe programming artefacts whether a teacher was a specialist or a generalist, what training they had received on programming or design, the age group taught and programming language used. Teachers were more likely to call a complex code snippet an ‘algorithm’ than a simpler one and more likely to select the term to describe code snippets than a design artefact. We make suggestions of how to alleviate the problems including that teachers are introduced to the idea of ambiguous representations of algorithms and a process which refines the representation from ambiguous to unambiguous as the design progresses.}

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital competencies, the need for a robust and universal method to assess students’ algorithmic thinking (AT) skills has become increasingly pronounced. Algorithmic thinking refers to the ability to analyse a problem and develop a step-by-step process to solve it. This research investigates the efficacy of the Cross Array Task (CAT) as an assessment tool for AT skills within Switzerland’s compulsory education system. Originally conceptualised as an unplugged activity, where students performed the task without digital technologies (e.g., by using gestures on paper) and an administrator manually assessed them, the CAT evolved into a digital activity that runs on an iPad. The CAT’s digital transformation has automated the scoring of student responses and data collection, streamlining the assessment processes and facilitating efficient large-scale assessments. It has also enhanced scalability, making the CAT suitable for widespread use in educational settings. Furthermore, it provides immediate feedback to students and educators, supporting timely interventions and personalised learning experiences. Our study aims to comprehensively investigate algorithmic competencies in compulsory education, examining their variations and influencing factors. This research examines key variables, such as age, sex, educational environment and school characteristics (e.g., the level and grade of education), and regional factors (e.g., the canton of the school) in Switzerland, and characteristics related to the specific assessment tool, including the type of artefact used, the complexity of the algorithms generated, and the level of autonomy. Additionally, it seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the unplugged and digital approaches in assessing AT skills, specifically comparing the unplugged and virtual CAT versions, aiming to provide insights into their advantages and potential synergies. This investigation delineates the developmental progression of AT skills across compulsory education, emphasising the influence of age on algorithm development and problem-solving strategies. Furthermore, we reveal the impact of artefacts and the potential of digital tools to facilitate advanced AT skill development across diverse age groups. Finally, our investigation delves into the influence of school environments and sex disparities on AT performance, alongside the significant individual variability influenced by personal abilities and external circumstances. These findings underscore the importance of tailored educational interventions and equitable practices to accommodate diverse learning profiles and optimise student outcomes in AT across educational settings.}

abstract = {The introduction of interactive assets in public exhibitions is capable to significantly enhance the visitors’ user experience. However, the creation of interactive applications could represent a challenging task, especially for users lacking computer skills. Visual programming languages (VPLs) – one of the instruments belonging to the broad categories of methods and tools devised to support end-user development (EUD) – promise to offer an intuitive way to overcome these limitations, by providing easy-to-use and efficient interfaces for encoding applications’ logic. Moving from these considerations, this paper first analyses pros and cons of tools devised so far to support the generation of interactive contents. Then, it presents the design of a new tool named Visual Scene Editor (VSE), which allows users with little to no programming skills to create 3D interactive applications by combining available assets through an interactive, visual process. Both objective and subjective measurements have been collected with both skilled and unskilled users to evaluate the performance of the proposed tool. A comparison with existing solutions shows a reduction in the time required to complete the assigned tasks, of the complexity of the logic created, as well as of the number of errors made, confirming the suitability of the VSE for the said purpose.}

abstract = {Purpose
In recent years, studies have shown that machine learning significantly improves student performance and retention and reduces the risk of student dropout and withdrawal. However, there is a lack of empirical research reviews focusing on the application of machine learning to predict student performance in terms of learning engagement and self-efficacy and exploring their relationships. Hence, this paper conducts a systematic research review on the application of machine learning in higher education from an empirical research perspective.
Design/methodology/approach
This systematic review examines the application of machine learning (ML) in higher education, focusing on predicting student performance, engagement and self-efficacy. The review covers empirical studies from 2016 to 2024, utilizing a PRISMA framework to select 67 relevant articles from major databases.
Findings
The findings show that ML applications are widely researched and published in high-impact journals. The primary functions of ML in these studies include performance prediction, engagement analysis and self-efficacy assessment, employing various ML algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines and neural networks. Ensemble learning algorithms generally outperform single algorithms regarding accuracy and other evaluation metrics. Common model evaluation metrics include accuracy, F1 score, recall and precision, with newer methods also being explored.
Research limitations/implications
First, empirical research literature was selected from only four renowned electronic journal databases, and the literature was limited to journal articles, with the latest review literature and conference papers published in the form of conference papers also excluded, which led to empirical research not obtaining the latest views of researchers in interdisciplinary fields. Second, this review focused mainly on the analysis of student grade prediction, learning engagement and self-efficacy and did not study students’ risk, dropout rates, retention rates or learning behaviors, which limited the scope of the literature review and the application field of machine learning algorithms. Finally, this article only conducted a systematic review of the application of machine learning algorithms in higher education and did not establish a metadata list or carry out metadata analysis.
Originality/value
The review highlights ML’s potential to enhance personalized education, early intervention and identifying at-risk students. Future research should improve prediction accuracy, explore new algorithms and address current study limitations, particularly the narrow focus on specific outcomes and lack of interdisciplinary perspectives.}

One medium that has affordances to assess and support creativity in young people is video games. In this paper, we briefly discuss the literature on video games and creativity and provide an example of current work being done relative to measuring creativity in the context of a game called Physics Playground using stealth assessment. To validate the stealth assessment of creativity, we conducted a one-group pretest-posttest study with 167 8th and 9th graders from a K-12 school in Florida. Results suggest that our stealth assessment of creativity is valid (i.e., our stealth assessment estimate significantly correlated with our external performance-based measures of creativity). Additional analyses revealed that creativity (i.e., estimated using our stealth assessment of creativity) significantly predicts in-game performance (e.g., number of levels solved), game enjoyment, and learning of physics content. We conclude with a discussion of future directions in this line of creativity research.}

Various excellent works are constantly emerging in the field of ML assisted or dominated development of energy storage material, such as exploring of new materials, studying of battery performance, investigating of battery aging mechanism. In this paper, we methodically review recent advances in discovery and performance prediction of energy storage materials relying on ML. After a brief introduction to the general workflow of ML, we provide an overview of the current status and dilemmas of ML databases commonly used in energy storage materials. The typical applications and examples of ML to the finding of novel energy storage materials and the performance forecasting of electrode and electrolyte materials. Furthermore, we explore the dilemmas that will be faced in the development of applied ML-assisted or dominated energy storage materials and propose a corresponding outlook. This review systematically summarizes the current development of ML-assisted energy storage materials research, which is expected to point the way for its further development.}

We found that teachers used the exploratory activities to introduce the program, and other activities to encourage differentiated, student-paced practice of math concepts. Students were interested and engaged in using Owlet during the pilot tests, leading to student driven generation of challenges. Through development, Owlet, as a whole program, spanned more math concepts by prioritizing flexibility in one tangible interface and concreteness in the other. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each tangible device.}

We believe that the field of CCIU is at an important point in its development, analogous to when a child becomes a teen. Over the last few years we have each had many informal conversations with other CCI researchers in which we discuss issues such as, what is our responsibility as researchers beyond academe? What values underlie our conceptions of a ”good” childhood and the role of interactive technology in it? And, how do we ensure that our field continues to grow and evolve in ways that are consistent with our responsibilities and values? To address these and other complex questions that have been drawing our attention we came together to reflect, discuss and create a position paper for our community, in which we outline some of the issues we see facing our community at this time. To inform our deliberations with opinions beyond our own we conducted an informal consultation with 25 members of the CCI community. Our responders spanned junior to senior researchers, represented diverse geographies and included industry practitioners. These diverse responses provided further content for our reflections, and helped us see perspectives beyond our own. The result of this informal process is this speculative paper in which we propose a series of seven provocations that aim to disrupt some of the normative assumptions held in our field. Our goal in doing this is to open up dialogue in our community about these issues and promote consideration of the alternative visions we present for where we might focus our attention and efforts. We see our contribution not as truth or a definitive statement of a vision for the field, but rather as our opinion about some of the complex issues we face and that we think should be considered through dialogue as we move into the next phase of our development as an academic and scholarly community. We believe that it is urgent and critical for our field that we take up these questions, explore diverse perspectives, and critically work towards decisions and actions that will define our identity and the value of our contributions as we move forward into the next 20 years of research in CCI.}

Today's increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. Algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be influenced by prejudice, conflicts of interest, or fatigue. However, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. In this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric AI: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy.}

This study aims to comprehensively understand and structure the research on AI literacy for AI users through a systematic, scoping literature review. Therefore, we synthesize the literature, provide a conceptual framework, and develop a research agenda. Our review paper holistically assesses the fragmented AI literacy research landscape (68 papers) while critically examining its specificity to different user groups and its distinction from other technology literacies, exposing that research efforts are partly not well integrated. We organize our findings in an overarching conceptual framework structured along the learning methods leading to, the components constituting, and the effects stemming from AI literacy.

What kinds of capabilities do people need in a world infused with AI? How can we conceptualise these capabilities? How can we help learners develop them? How can we empirically study and assess their development? With this paper, we open the discussion by adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. Our team of 11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written discussion. Engaging in a semi-independent and semi-joint written polylogue, we assembled a pool of ideas of what these capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop them. Simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine our hypothetical views. In synthesising these ideas, we propose that there is a need to move beyond AI-centred views of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values.}

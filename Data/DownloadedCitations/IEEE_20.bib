  year={2016},

  abstract={A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.},

  abstract={Technological devices programmed through parallel computing are increasingly present in people's daily lives. They are responsible for processing images that we see on computers, televisions, cell phones and games. It is a fact that parallel processing is a reality, so computer professionals need to know the peculiarities of this form of programming. However, teaching parallel computing is not a simple task, the computational thinking parallel is quite different from that for the sequential processing. This work, then proposes a new methodology for teaching parallel computing for young beginners in programming. Our technique is based on principles of unplugged computing, like to learn doing and playing. We believe that unplugged computing can be very useful in teaching the difficult concepts of parallel computing 1},

  pages={01-05},
  abstract={New (interdisciplinary) Computer Science (CS) subjects in K-12 education have been introduced in recent years. Most of them have educational plans derived from CS Frame-works such as the K-12 CS Framework. To some extent the educational plans have the same core topic areas: data and coding (including data compression and data structures), algorithms (in-volving variables and software projects), computers and networks (covering topics like logic tables and data transmission) and information society and data security (consisting of collection and processing of personal data and asymmetric encryption). Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas. These core topic areas are part of the educational plan of the new interdisciplinary subject IMP (Informatics, Mathematics, Physics) for secondary schools in Germany. The test was piloted with 156 (m = 117, f = 37, o = 2) 10th grade students, approximately aged 16 at the end of the lower secondary level. We used the Item-Response-Theory (IRT) to validate the test. This work in progress paper presents translated items and the psychometric evaluation of the piloted test. The contribution for both researchers and educators in the CS education research field is the set of items of the research-based CS test in the four core topic areas for 10th grade students that includes item sets for the areas computers and networks and information society and data security.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={22-23},
  abstract={Learning how to program has become a trend in Taiwan even for younger students. IoT is a topic to interest new learners in programming. Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students’ learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one’s working memory capacity. According to the research results, one’s working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students’ cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject. We designed an experiment for an IoT-related after-school club in a junior high school to evaluate the relationship between students’ operation span and learning performance.},

Two of the authors have been involved in the re-design, implementation and execution of a basic programming and CT course, offered to first-semester students as part of the Information science, IT and interaction design bachelor program, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The central problem we faced in restructuring our introductory course, was finding a game genre that could support creative coding for beginners, be motivational and recognizable by the students, and would work with our use-modify-create learning approach. Our findings suggest that point-and-click games are an effective way to provide scaffolding and ease non-technical students into P5 programming. The genre has good expressive power, and the students were motivated because they recognized and could relate to the games they worked on. Future work will address students’ problems with scaling up the point-and-click games.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a method to grade programming exam questions automatically. Our motivation is that there are no robust and scalable automatic methods for the analysis of computational thinking from source code programmed by elementary-level students. The approach to this problem supports the improvement of PC development in primary and secondary school students. The validation of the method is performed through the assessment of the answers of primary school students to programming exercises using a programming language called LIE++. The method assesses student answers using several techniques such as the analysis of programming structures, code clones and the execution of code based on input and output values defined during the specification of the exercises. The use of these techniques provides specific scores to obtain a grade of the student’s answer. The source code analysis and scoring of exercise answers is carried out using high-performance computing for improving system response time. This research contributes a scalable method for the automatic evaluation of exams, which we expect to support the development of PC.},

  abstract={As blended learning models gain popularity, analyzing the online learning behaviors of college students has emerged as a crucial approach to enhancing teaching effectiveness. The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the learning behavior data from 44 students specializing in computer-related subjects on the online platform of the “Introduction to Computational Thinking” course, utilizing clustering algorithms. Subsequently, we utilized the Pearson correlation coefficient method to delve into the intricate relationship between diverse behavioral traits and academic performance. Our research has revealed that cluster analysis is adept at discerning behavioral disparities among students. Specifically, we identified four types of learning groups with different learning characteristics. Furthermore, a notable correlation was observed between homework scores and key evaluation metrics, including academic performance. Based on these findings, this study proposes targeted learning strategies and teaching suggestions, aiming to help educators better guide students in learning and improve the effectiveness of blended learning.},

  abstract={The rapid spread of the CoViD-19 pandemic in early 2020 and the adoption of social distancing and "stay-at-home" orders gave rise to the sudden need for schools to be able to provide effective remote teaching. In Italy and elsewhere, the introduction of distance learning technologies has significantly impacted the education of students and limited their social interaction and activities, among which are school trips and other scholastic experiences. To support the constrained educational possibilities of Italian schools, we developed "ActiveViewer", a technological platform that enables massive and interactive remote events, and performed a year-long large-scale experiment, providing a series of massive remote school trips to several Italian cities. We designed a new school trip format, named "CodyTrip" that merges coding and computational thinking with elements of traditional school outings, and provides an engaging experience for participants. In this paper, we present the format and five online trips performed during the school year 2020/2021. The results based on user feedback support the adoption of the tool not only as a stopgap measure for school outings throughout the pandemic but as an accessible and inclusive tool to widen the possibilities of cultural tourism.},

For older students, a more formal methodology is proposed that uses the Bloch Sphere representation via the CreatiCode platform. This paper discusses an implementation of the proposal with high school groups, including statistical analysis and feedback collection to assess concept acquisition, strengths, weaknesses and student satisfaction. Data is gathered through questionnaires and interviews, enabling comparison with external test groups for comprehensive evaluation.

Therefore, the STEM research center of Universitas Syiah Kuala in collaboration with other stakeholders in education, namely government, industry, public, and media has launched the Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Character (STEMC) learning approach. There are six aspects to be developed through the STEMC approach: critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, computational thinking, and characters. In general, the nature of STEMC is not only a process of transferring knowledge from teachers to students but also an effort to build students' character. STEMC approach is designed to improve students' scientific abilities, motivation, and perseverance. It means that every phase of learning is designing to support students' intellectual and emotional growth. This paper aims to address what has been done at the STEM Research Center of Universitas Syiah Kuala and the plan for integrating STEMC in Indonesia.

One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand AI.},

Regardless of the fact that blending of AI/ML and online/digital gaming is a significant and critical subject for classroom pedagogy, there is indeed a paucity of comprehensive literature review in this domain. The aim of this paper is to take cognizance of recent studies and new findings on games that may be used to enhance AI/ML integrated pedagogy for effective curriculum transaction. Relevant articles and games were identified after a thorough exploration and were then included in this qualitative content analysis. This paper presents an overview of important published studies and games, as well as demonstrate how diverse games offer an exceptional and innovative prospect to educate a wealth of concepts and themes in AI and ML.},

  abstract={Educational Robotics (ER) has revealed several benefits in the educational context, not only helping the teaching of disciplines, but also making possible the development of several abilities, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity. Among various robotics kits, LEGO® Robotics has been shown one of the best results considering some evaluated criteria (modularity level, hardware, curriculum, price, etc.). Some studies analyze the teaching practices, some compare technologies, and others evaluate the kits in a pedagogical way. However, it is essential to investigate all these contexts together in order to improve the impact produced by the ER in education and to know the best teaching practices associated with the most powerful technologies. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) environments and programming languages adopted in the LEGO® Robotics context, b) educational practices applied during classes based on LEGO® Robotics, and c) the educational levels in which robotics has been applied with positive results. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out a systematic review of the literature. Our main findings are: a) the most widely used environment and programming language are LabVIEW along with the LEGO®'s block-based programming language, b) we identified LEGO® Robotics is used for teaching programming, interdisciplinary contents, participation in tournaments, robotics, and computational thinking, c) LEGO® Robotics is used with success by students of different levels, such as K12, undergraduate, and graduated. Finally, we discuss some problems and limitations related to ER and point out that there is no standardization of teaching practices or methodologies for evaluating results, indicating that more research is needed to find the best scenario regarding technologies, methods, and target audience.},

  abstract={As computational thinking becomes increasingly important for children to learn, we must develop interfaces that leverage the ways that young children learn to provide opportunities for them to develop these skills. Active Learning Environments with Robotic Tangibles (ALERT) and Robopad, an analogous on-screen virtual spatial programming environment for educational Human Robot Interaction (HRI), have been developed. Evaluations of these in the context of free play and open-ended learning activities show that both systems afford opportunities for young children to engage in spatial programming, creating improvisational and sequential programs that mediate interactions between the environment, robots, and humans in responsive and creative ways. These systems demonstrate innovative opportunities for advancing mixed reality spatial programming activities as a form of HRI that fosters engaging seamless cyberlearning experiences, across formal and informal environments.},

  abstract={Currently, there is a "boom" in introductory programming courses to help students develop their computational thinking skills. Providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. However, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), prove this task a challenge. One solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. Automatic techniques focus on: a) Functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices, b) Software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors, and c) Comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. This paper presents a semantic-aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions. These snippets are modeled as subgraph patterns with natural language feedback attached to them. Submissions are transformed into extended program dependence graphs combining control and data flows. We leverage subgraph matching techniques to compute the adequate personalized feedback. Also, constraints correlating patterns allow performing fine-grained assessments. We have evaluated our method on several introductory programming assignments and a large number of submissions. Our technique delivered personalized feedback in milliseconds using a small set of patterns, which makes it appealing in real-world settings.},

  abstract={Technology and computer learning have acquired a great projection in the field of education. Arduino arises from current technological innovations with the intention of promoting a new approach to learning through machines. The objective of this research is to analyze the evolution of the Arduino concept in the scientific literature. To achieve this aim, a bibliometric methodology based on scientific mapping and an analysis of co-words has been used. The scientific production of Arduino indexed in Web of Science has been analyzed. We have worked with an analysis unit of 346 documents. The results of this research show that the scientific production on Arduino in the field of education starts in 2010 until today. The communications in the congresses to present the results of the investigations developed are the most used means of diffusion. The National University of Distance Education and the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu are particularly noteworthy. The authors with more scientific production in this field of study are Bogdan, M. and Castro, M. It is significant that the collection of studies on this subject is carried out, above all, by EDULEARN Proceedings and INTED Proceedings. It can be concluded that the field of study on Arduino in the educational field is relatively recent, so that today, the basis for scientific research is still being established. However, the most relevant aspects in this field of study are physic experiments, computational thinking and computer-based learning.},

  abstract={The need for more post-secondary students to major and graduate in STEM fields is widely recognized. Students' motivation and strategic self-regulation have been identified as playing crucial roles in their success in STEM classes. But, how students' strategy use, self-regulation, knowledge building, and engagement impact different learning outcomes is not well understood. Our goal in this study was to investigate how motivation, strategic self-regulation, and creative competency were associated with course achievement and long-term learning of computational thinking knowledge and skills in introductory computer science courses. Student grades and long-term retention were positively associated with self-regulated strategy use and knowledge building, and negatively associated with lack of regulation. Grades were associated with higher study effort and knowledge retention was associated with higher study time. For motivation, higher learning- and task-approach goal orientations, endogenous instrumentality, and positive affect and lower learning-, task-, and performance-avoid goal orientations, exogenous instrumentality and negative affect were associated with higher grades and knowledge retention and also with strategic self-regulation and engagement. Implicit intelligence beliefs were associated with strategic self-regulation, but not grades or knowledge retention. Creative competency was associated with knowledge retention, but not grades, and with higher strategic self-regulation. Implications for STEM education are discussed.},

  abstract={Scratch Day is made up of a global network of events. Its main goal is to bring people together to celebrate Scratch. Scratch is a free encryption platform that can be used online and offline for children. Scratch Day events bring together young people from the Scratch community. During these meetings, attendees share projects, learn from each other and welcome newcomers. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Currently, innovation and motivation of students during the learning process are promoted by educational robotics tools. Robots are increasingly integrated into our society. To such an extent that robots are becoming more and more common in our everyday environment. This paper presents a workshop which is focused on two main objectives. The first one is to celebrate Scratch Day promoting Scratch locally. On the other hand, this event is aimed to present a robotic educational tool for people as the first step to get into robotics world. This workshop is aimed on those adults who want to discover what possibilities Scratch brings in the introduction to robotics. Throughout this workshop an initiation to Scratch is developed in the context of educational robotics. As the most significant results throughout the workshop, it is clearly demonstrated that Scratch is an ideal tool for children and adults with no previous programming or robotic experience to begin learning both through hands-on experiences. Throughout this work the importance of combining theory and practice is shown in order to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.},

  abstract={There is a strong movement asserting the importance of quality education all over the world and for students of all ages. Many educators believe that in order to achieve this 21st century skills must be taught and that digital literacy should be coupled with rigorous Computer Science principles and computational thinking. Accordingly this work will describe a didactic experience in an introductory programming course by describing the context, pedagogical approach, content of the course based on a procedure-first approach, technologies used, research questions addressed, experimental design adopted, data collection and analysis and the main conclusion supported by qualitative and quantitative data. The research questions focus on understanding which is the best medium to design algorithms by comparing flow chart and the Scratch programming language and by evaluating whether using textual language is worth the effort of the syntactic burden imposed by these languages. An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that both a visual programming and a flow-chart approach are suitable for algorithm design with no statistical difference in terms of number of errors and time taken to write the corresponding code in a textual language. However, the high number of errors suggest that using visual programming allows the student to focus on the problem solving activities.},

  abstract={There is a strong worldwide movement which is pushing for the teaching of serious computer science principles besides reading, writing and basic numeracy starting from first grade and reaching all students across all grades. This is being done through both formal initiatives carried out by international organizations and at the national level by putting forward curricula, some of which are mandatory. In order to accomplish this goal, and based on the consensus that computer science is not programming and that programming languages are a tool, visual languages have become the preferred method for teaching introductory courses in computer science. The absence of rigid syntactic rules makes them the ideal tool for focusing on problem solving and computational thinking activities. Recent reports have pointed out the need for supporting the international community of teachers by providing assessment methods, an internationally validated question repository as well as tools and assessment platforms. In this context our work presents an assessment platform for formative, summative and informal assessment of computer science competencies by using a visual language, namely App Inventor, which allows for the rapid development of a mobile app and has a strong appeal to the younger generation of students. The capability to log user activity allows the teacher to monitor the progression in the student's learning path as well as her/his solution-building approach.},

  abstract={The planning and scheduling of container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) are the multi-objective and multiple strong constraints combinatorial optimization challenges under the uncertain environments, and those are provided with high goal orientation, dynamics, context-sensitivity, coupling, timeliness, and complexity. The increasingly sophisticated decision-making for CTLS is one of the most pressing problems for the programming and optimization method available. This paper discusses CTLS in terms of logistics generalized computation complexity based on computational thinking, great principles of computing, and computational lens, which three are abbreviated with 3CTGPL, and makes a definition of container terminal oriented logistics generalized computational complexity (CTO-LGCC) and container terminal logistics generalized computation comprehensive performance perspective (CTL-GCCPP) from the dimensions of time, space, communication, processor, and memory access. Both can analyze, generalize, migrate, translate, localize, modificate, and evaluate the above-complicated problems and lay solid foundations and establish a feedback improvement framework for the computational model and scheduling algorithms of the CTLS, which is an essential complement to the modeling and optimization methodology and solutions to CTLS with computational logistics. Finally, aimed at the logistics service cases for a large-scale container terminal, the simulation is designed and implemented for different scheduling algorithms, and the qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis is executed for the concomitant CTO-LGCC that demonstrates and verifies the feasibility and credibility of the CTO-LGCC and CTL-GCCPP from the viewpoint of the practice of container terminal decision-making support on the tactical level.},

  abstract={Introducing coding in early education improves the logical and computational thinking in kids. However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.},

  pages={168850-168868},
  abstract={Educational digital storytelling is widely recognised as a powerful approach in developing literary skills, experiencing problem-solving and computational thinking, information and knowledge visualisation, building creativity and divergent thinking supported by technological solutions. However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else’s story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. We can conclude that Novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity.},

  abstract={From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.},

  abstract={Difficulties in teaching and learning introductory programming have been studied over the years. The students’ difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. Early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. This work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities.},

  abstract={Thousands of videos are posted online every day. The affordability of video editing tools and social networks has facilitated the creation and spread of videos carrying disinformation, i.e. fake videos. Previous attempts to categorize disinformation have focused on content analysis and ascertaining the intention of creators. To extend these approaches, it is beneficial to incorporate the perspective of other fields that study the trustworthiness of records, such as archival science, to help detect and categorize fake videos. This paper proposes to leverage archival science in combination with computer engineering to devise a new framework for detecting and categorizing fake videos. In doing so, the paper offers a case study of the way in which Computational Archival Science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake videos.},

  abstract={Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students.},

  abstract={Full paper. One of the biggest challenges in education is the transfer of innovations and new didactic approaches into the school system. To ensure a high standard of teaching, it is essential that the teachers' expertise, pedagogical content knowledge as well as digital competences are continuously improved by further training. In-service training for teachers is offered in different settings (short-, middle- and long term), with advantages and disadvantages. Two aspects that correlate positively are the costs and the sustainable outcome of these trainings. With these aspects in mind the Educational Pyramid Scheme (EPS) is currently being developed and implemented as part of an Erasmus Plus project. It is an innovative concept that aims at spreading new learning contents and methods in a relatively short time within the school system, with low costs and high effect. It is inspired by the economical pyramid scheme, which is designed to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities. The transaction content of the Educational Pyramid Scheme refers to methods or strategies that are being exchanged, and to the resources and capabilities that are required to enable the exchange. According to a train-the-trainer principle, teachers and pupils will be qualified to be trainers, who then spread their knowledge and skills to people in their school and beyond. The EPS contains three different functions or roles: multipliers (teachers and scientists), mentors (teachers) and tutors (pupils). The motivation to participate is maintained with a benefit system adapted for each target group. The training of target groups follows high qualitative standards and therefore presents different phases: input, practical phase and reflection. This paper describes the development of the EPS and its first implementation in the framework of the Austrian mandatory curriculum "Basic Digital Education" including computational thinking and programming. It presents some qualitative results gained so far from interviews and observation, which are satisfactory and deliver good arguments for the further implementation of the EPS.},

We prove the feasibility of the idea by: (i) collecting a large dataset of board game information; (ii) designing and testing an information processing pipeline for automatically discovering game categories and game mechanics, with some first encouraging results. In the future, we plan to further generalize this approach for different kinds of games and for discovering currently unknown but useful aspects, e.g. games or game features that could better foster Computational Thinking in education, those better suited to be applied in social distancing contexts, and so on.},

  abstract={Whilst there has been growing interest in the use of social robots in educational settings, the majority of this research focuses on learning outcomes, with less emphasis on the social processes surrounding these interactions. One such understudied factor is children’s trust in the robot as a teacher. Trust is a relevant domain in that if and how children trust a robot could influence their subsequent learning outcomes. The extent to which the robot’s behaviour (including making errors) influences trust is yet to be fully explored. Consequently, the goal of this research is to determine the role of trust in children’s learning from social robots. We report a pilot study investigating the conceptualisation and measurement of chil-dren’s trust in robots. 33 children aged between 4-9 completed a computational thinking learning task with a NAO robot at a Science Festival. Observations of the interactions in terms of developing tasks and measurements for child robot interaction are discussed. The findings tentatively suggest children’s trust in the robot can be divided into two parts: social affiliation towards the robot, and perceived competence/reliability of the robot.},

  abstract={Nowadays, it is increasing the importance of developing skills related to the computational thinking at earlier stages of education, and the adoption of tools that implement the visual programming paradigm has been well succeeded in presenting introductory notions of programming from kindergarten to college. Such tools allows the user to program while manipulating blocks that represent programming languages instructions. iVProg is among this class of tools and was firstly implemented in Java and could be integrated to Moodle using iAssign. Due to technological evolution, iVProg also evolved to iVProgH and its integration to Moodle is still possible by using the new version of iAssign that allow the integration of HTML stack packages to Moodle. In this paper we describe how this evolution takes place and presents iVProgH functionalities as well as iAssign extension to include HTML packages into Moodle. In addition, we give some teaching support whenever integrated using iVProgH with Moodle using iAssign.},

  abstract={Programming skills and computational thinking are fundamental concerns in professional training in Science, Technology' Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. In spite of this, in the Chilean higher education system, as in most parts of the world, teaching programming is a challenging endeavor, partly because the majority of freshmen students in STEM undergraduate programs have not been introduced to the fundamentals of the discipline and its applications in K12 education. Therefore, students' attitudes, engagement, and autonomous learning can make a difference in how students in STEM disciplines in higher education face their first programming course. In the present study, we carried out measurement of variables associated to these constructs involving a sample of 1694 freshmen of seventeen STEM programs in a Chilean research university. Relevant differences were found among different STEM programs, and by student gender. Implications of the results obtained and future research avenues are discussed.},

  abstract={Scratch is a popular programming platform with plenty of learning resources. However, it is quite difficult for users to find suitable resources. In this paper, in order to provide the resources which the users require, we propose a Scratch Recommendation Framework Adaptive to User Interest Drifts (SRFA-UID). First, a user interest drifts model is designed, which adopts the time decay factor and the weights of operation behaviors to track users' dynamic interest. Then, on the basis of users' current and historical interest, we calculate their combined user similarity. Next, we present a novel two-hop-algorithm to update users' friend community. Considering the preferences of the whole friend community, the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users and the impact factors of items, we put forward a recommendation function to obtain items that are related to users. For an item, the function can calculate its F value to determine if we can recommend it to the users. Experimental results show that SRFA-UID performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in the Scratch dataset.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the skills needed by Higher Education (HE) students to become successful Internet of Things (IoT) future leaders/developers. The paper focuses on the programming and Maths aspects, being fundamental to IoT development, in addition to computational thinking and coding concepts for the HE students. The research objective is to build a framework for developing IoT skills within higher education to establish the computing competencies needed for this rapidly expanding technology. The investigation included the most widely used programming language for IoT, Python, and the Maths skills at the HE level, which are essential for developing successful infrastructure, functionality, security algorithms and encryption tools for IoT. Quantitative research methodology is applied on empirical data obtained on non-Computer Science students (Non-CS) in a HE institution in UAE. There is a correlation between in university (InUni) Maths skills and Python programming course's performance. Compared to Engineering students, Business students may found it more challenging to learn Python programming language, which also applies to their Maths skills. This suggests better IoT competencies developed by Engineering students. The paper concluded that N on-CS students are able to obtain sufficient knowledge of, and skills in, using Python within one semester. The future study should consider other factors, such as general knowledge, business awareness, technology applications and legal issues.},

  pages={30544-30561},
  abstract={In advance to the present study, the authors introduced a method which makes it possible to calculate the entropy of natural language digital texts, focusing on word-processed texts, presentations, and webpages. This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses – the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data – generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group ( $2\times67$  hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students’ and end-users’ computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability – beyond hardware and software development and recycling – with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. However, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is a crucial 21st-century skill, and its integration into K–12 education underscores the need for effective assessment tools. Although there are existing tools to measure CT practices, improvements can be made in terms of their assessment formats and data analysis methods. To address this gap, this study develops Critters Puzzle (CP), a game-based assessment tool aimed at measuring primary school students’ CT practices, specifically abstraction skills. Based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, 12 progressively challenging tasks were developed. To ensure the content validity of the tool, validation was put forward involving expert review and students’ cognitive interviews. Twenty-two experts were invited to review the appropriateness of the measurement and seven students (aged 6–10) were invited for interviews to evaluate the usability of the platform and its effectiveness as an assessment tool. Results indicated that the game is engaging, understandable, and appropriately challenging for students, and several modifications were made to the game based on the feedback from experts and interviewees. Future research will involve empirical studies to validate the game's psychometric properties, including its reliability and validity, as an assessment tool for CT practices.},

  abstract={This article describes the creation of an interactive model of the Ilse Teske Sculpture Park by students from 6th to 9th grade at Professor Georgina de Carvalho Ramos da Luz Elementary School. The project was born from an activity developed by the Educational Robotics Club, which aimed to integrate technology and education. Using Arduino robotics kits, the students applied concepts of computational thinking, digital culture, and programming to build an interactive replica of the park. The project also sought to promote the cultural heritage of Brusque, Santa Catarina, encourage creativity and innovation among students, and foster educational tourism in the city. There were some challenges, but the students persisted and completed the model. They successfully presented it at the 1st Education, Technology, Innovation, and Science Exhibition, where they won second place in the Tinkercad and Arduino categories.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper presents the development and use of empathy interviews at Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) which is the fifth largest school district in the state. At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.},

  abstract={Teachers living and working in rural areas in the United States often lack access to high-quality professional development (PD) opportunities. As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, the teaching of coding and computational thinking has become increasingly important in the school environment. If before they were a secondary part of the teaching program and provided only, at best, from the age of eleven and up, it is now clear that they should play a relevant role in the school curriculum as soon as possible. In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period. This work therefore aims to choose some of the tools available, designed for different needs but sufficiently similar in order to allow the development of a fluid and continuous coding educational path, gradually adding new complexities, starting from the age of three in the school of childhood, up to high school.},

  pages={1-2},
  abstract={A key strategy for bringing computer science (CS) education to all students is the integration of computational thinking (CT) into core curriculum in elementary school. But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All.},

  abstract={Sound recognition refers to the technology or process of identifying and classifying different sounds or audio signals. This study aims to develop a sound recognition system using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to classify and identify the gender of catfish based on their speech patterns. The study explores a range of supervised ML and DL algorithms, such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, to predict the gender of catfish. The extracted features from the audio signals of the catfish serve as inputs to these algorithms, which produce binary predictions classifying the catfish samples as either male or female. This study further explores data analysis of the audio signals from the male and female catfish. The automated sound recognition system proves to be a more efficient and accurate approach compared to traditional methods, which rely on time-consuming visual observations. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, and more, were employed to gauge the effectiveness of the algorithms in predicting the gender of catfish based on speech patterns. Among the employed algorithms, ANN and NB demonstrate the highest accuracy, achieving a score of 89.47%.},

  abstract={Health care is the improvement of health through the avoidance and cure of diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a substantial health issue, ranking as the eighth leading cause of death and the tenth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years for both genders. This research aims to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately predict the presence of CKD, which affects people worldwide. Timely identification of CKD is crucial to prevent it from progressing to its final and most critical phase. Machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, are used in this study for the prediction of CKD. Various health parameters such as age, albumin level, and more are used as input into each ML algorithm to predict the presence of CKD. Data preprocessing is carried out to improve the quality of the data for more accurate prediction. The data is analyzed to uncover the connections between CKD health parameters and their impact on the occurrence of CKD. This research further examines the influence of different train and test data ratios on the accuracy of the employed algorithms. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and more are employed to gauge the effectiveness of each algorithm in making predictions. Random Forest stood out as the most accurate algorithm, with a score of 96.25%. Naive Bayes and XGBoost demonstrated the highest sensitivity, achieving a perfect score of 100%.},

  abstract={This study demonstrates the utilization of Machine Learning (ML) for network slice prediction, enabling the optimization of resources for diverse network slices. Traditional methods for network slice prediction often lack efficiency and result in inaccuracies. By leveraging ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, an intelligent framework that automates network slice prediction is developed. This framework enhances network virtualization and management, facilitating resource allocation. The ML algorithms take real-time network conditions and usages, such as packet delay and smart city, as input and output for selecting the most suitable network slice. Data analysis is further conducted to reveal the connections between the input parameters and how these parameters influence the selection of the accurate network slice. Network slicing plays a crucial role as it enables the customization of services and facilitates efficient scaling to meet the specific needs of different applications and industries. The accuracy scores of the employed ML algorithms were generally perfect, except for the KNN and SVM classifiers, which achieved an accuracy of 94.30% and 92.16%, respectively, for the prediction of network slices based on incoming network connections and usages.},

  abstract={In a world where algorithms are ubiquitous, the development of computational thinking competencies is becoming progressively important among students, technology professionals, and 21st-century citizens in general. Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.},

  abstract={Our contemporary society necessitates professionals equipped with 21st-century skills. Disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (known as STEAM) have been particularly effective in fostering these skills. However, when considering students with disabilities, especially those with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD), this assertion often falls short. In this context, the RoboSTEAMSEN project emerges as an initiative designed to enhance educational processes by providing teachers of IDD students with the necessary resources to promote STEAM engagement. The project proposes the use of active learning methodologies and robotics to achieve this goal. The primary objective of the project is realized through several strategies: understanding the needs of students with disabilities and adapting the use of robotics and active learning methodologies accordingly; training teachers in the use of these resources; and creating a platform to exchange experiences, resources, lessons learned, tools, case scenarios, etc., while reaching other potential stakeholders such as caregivers and policymakers. The main outcomes of the project are teacher training programs and the development of associated competencies, tools to identify and classify resources for the students, and technological platforms to ensure the sustain ability of the project once it concludes.},

  abstract={This article develops an instruction method for promoting design innovation capability through a design-based program with identification, modeling, simulation, and prototyping (IMSP). The computational thinking and conceptualization of sustainability were incorporated. The interaction between instruction treatment and participants' personality was investigated. Eighty-six engineering undergraduates participated in this experimental study for exploring the effectiveness of the IMSP program. The findings indicate that 1) the IMSP program promoted undergraduates' computational thinking, and further enhanced their design innovation ability; 2) the program that integrated the conceptualization of sustainability has better teaching effects than that without the conceptual integration; 3) the personal characters of innovation proaction and emotional intelligence acted as moderators in the ISMP program. This study presents a practical method for improving design innovation capability, and supports the feasibility and necessity of emphasizing computational thinking and sustainability in the innovation training program for engineering education.},

  abstract={Computational thinking education nowadays gets more attention around the world because of its importance. In Indonesia, computational thinking has not received attention as much as in other developed countries. However, there is a community that already focuses on promoting computational thinking to Indonesian students through annual competitions, which is Bebras Indonesia. The problems that are used in the competition also have been adapted into a game. The game aims to help student practicing for the competition, but the game still has several limitations to be used by Indonesian students. Therefore, this paper researches similar games design interaction that suits Indonesian students, particularly for upper elementary school students. The type of the game is a serious game that has the main goal of learning. An approach of user-centered design was used to develop the design interaction. Usability testing was conducted to verify the result of the design interaction in two iterations. The result of the research shows that the design interaction is effective with a score of completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with a score of SEQ 6,37 out of 7. It is also enjoyable for students based on the result of the E-Gameflow questionnaire score of 5,83 out of 7 and an IMI enjoyability score of 5,77 out of 7.},

  abstract={The introduction of Computational Thinking skills at school has mostly been associated with programming skills. In this paper we present an approach that is based on modeling, a skill that is commonly taught in Computer Science degrees, often in the last years as it is considered a higher-level, complex skill. Modeling includes various thinking processes like abstraction, reduction, structuring, generalization, among others, that are part of computational thinking in particular and problem solving in general, too. Our hypothesis is that using different modeling techniques from computer science (e.g., UML diagrams) in several subjects at school can be a good way to introduce computational thinking. Therefore we have performed a semi-controlled experiment with Ni=558 students (age 8-16) and N2=18 educators that have used modeling in their lessons. Our results show a promising effect of the use of modeling in the lessons. Educators have a positive vision of modeling.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This innovative practice paper describes a work in progress on creating and applying educational games that develop mathematical and computational thinking within the project Science&Math educational games from preschool to university - SciMaG. Using educational games, especially in STEM fields, is an effective way to engage students and promote key skills across different age groups and environments. Such activities promote problem solving, logical thinking, strategic planning, and other important skills and can be used with students of different age groups in the classroom, in extracurricular activities, or at home. STEM science outreach activities organized as part of science festivals and similar events can be an excellent opportunity for a game-based approach. However, organizing events for large numbers of participants can pose a logistical challenge in terms of volunteer availability. This paper presents the results of a study in which game-based activities to develop mathematical and computational thinking were integrated into a science outreach event for primary school students on the occasion of Pi-Day. The innovative aspect of the approach is reflected in the use of a combination of games (commercial, newly developed games, and games inspired by commercial ones) which have an interesting math basis and require mathematical or computational thinking skills as well as in the introduction of peer teaching through attracting high-school students as volunteers for the organized event. In the evaluation of the approach, the perceptions of the primary school students (Ns=295), their teachers (NT=19), and the high-school students participating as volunteers in the organized event (Nv=11) were examined using a questionnaire-based study. All groups of participants responded positively and confirmed educational potential of the games. Results confirmed that the activities were well-received and that such events have the potential to enhance learning experiences in STEM. The results also provide valuable insights and motivation for further development of educational games within the SciMaG project.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This innovative practice WIP paper describes how undergraduate students developed their curriculum development skills while designing an after-school program for learning computational thinking through writing. DEPICT (Discovering Computational Thinking through Creative Writing) is a pioneering project aimed at integrating computational thinking (CT) principles into high school (HS) creative writing (CW) classes. Developed by computer science (CS) undergraduate students, DEPICT for Out for School Time (DEPICT4OST) introduces a set of 16 innovative lessons designed to foster critical thinking, problem-solving, and algorithmic reasoning through the medium of CW. This WIP presents an exploration of the undergraduate experience in apprenticeship in the K12 outreach instructional space, crafting the DEPICT curriculum and the transformative journey of teaching others through the creation of engaging hands-on activities. Data was collected through pre- and post program surveys, classroom observations, and student work samples to assess the impact of the DEPICT program. The analysis involved comparing quantitative survey results, coding qualitative data from observations and students reflections, and evaluating changes in student work to determine the effectiveness of the program in achieving its educational goals. Drawing upon their expertise in CS and passion for creative expression, the undergraduate team embarked on the task of bridging the seemingly disparate domains of CT and CW. Through collaborative brainstorming sessions, iterative design processes, and pedagogical research, they developed a diverse range of lesson plans that seamlessly integrate computational concepts into writing prompts, narrative structures, and story-telling techniques. The practices of DEPICT4OST build upon a departmental emphasis on student ownership of outreach activity, which will be described in the paper. The paper explores the challenges of adapting complex computational concepts for HS students and aligning activities with educational standards. It also highlights the creative solutions the undergraduate team developed to make these abstract principles accessible and engaging through interactive writing exercises, group discussions, and multimedia presentations. Furthermore, the paper explores the pedagogical insights gained through the hands-on experience of teaching the DEPICT curriculum to HS students. The undergraduates reflect on their role as facilitators of learning, the impact of active learning techniques on student engagement, and the evolution of their teaching practices. By sharing anecdotes, student feedback, and reflections, the paper offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of infusing CT into CW education. In conclusion, DEPICT represents a pioneering initiative that harnesses the interactions between CT and creative expression to enrich HS education. The paper not only documents the development of the DEPICT curriculum but also underscores the transformative potential of collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches to education. Through the exploration of the under-graduate experience, it offers a roadmap for future endeavors seeking to innovate in the realm of STEAM education.},

  abstract={Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need for all students in primary and secondary education to learn computer science (CS) concepts and skills. Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities. Building on these findings, we discuss design implications for creating student-adaptive CS learning experiences in educational games that incorporate block-based programming enriched narrative-centered gameplay.},

  abstract={Programming is a traditional part of informatics education from Primary to Upper Secondary Education in Slovakia. We have seen a growing interest of using Python in programming at our secondary schools during the past six years. However, the transition from using the still prevalent Pascal to Python is often only formal, regardless of the language specifics of Python. In addition, teaching programming is oriented primarily to mastering language constructions. In the frame of the National project IT Academy we have focused on inquiry-based programming teaching. In our teaching and learning materials we exploit the 5E learning cycle. Firstly, pupils are engaged in a topic, then they explore a topic and give explanation for their findings, then elaborate on their learning and finally are evaluated. Their learning is not focused just on acquiring skills and experience using suitable Python commands and data structures, but also on using various problem solving strategies. The paper presents examples of teaching materials and interesting findings and comments from pilot teachers.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={This work-in-progress paper is part of a project that aims to analyze how the implementation of different instructional designs through complete and incomplete examples influence the cognitive load that students perceive when learning statistics and computer programming. For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.},

The work presented in this paper proposes a new way of teaching children programming using the Virtual Reality (VR) technology. A game has been implemented with Scratch-like background to test whether the immersive factor of VR would have a positive effect on the learning outcome of the children. A study has been conducted on 10 participants to compare between two techniques for teaching the basic programming concepts: VR game and Desktop game. Results showed that the mean of the learning gain of the VR group was higher than the Desktop mean but with no significant p-value. However, the engagement test results showed that the participants were more engaged to the VR game than the Desktop game with p-value of 0.032.},

  abstract={The adoption of technologies such as tablets or smartphones for children at home or at school is one of the most recent trends in today’s world. This challenges for suitable teaching methodologies and practices, along with oriented learning contents for such devices. On the one hand, teachers and tutors may acquire skills and competences to cope with gadgets and its technologies. On the other hand, learners must be versatile onto a complementary and complex environment in which the virtual meets the traditional lectures. Moreover, when the learning ecosystem includes children and younger newbies with technologies and gadgets is promising the adoption of targeted approaches such as gamification, playful activities and/or high interactive and supportive learning. This study presents the introduction of game-based learning techniques for young children at Cape Verde, with 17 students aged from 4 to 11 years, using the Code Karts app. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of the coding app, ability to play Code Karts, conceptual understanding of coding, and in-class behaviours. Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming. Complementary studies must be addressed aiming at to evaluate the long term effect on children due to the adoption of programming activities in the classroom.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.},

The visual interface, building block programming, and easy-to-use features of Scratch are suitable for teaching elementary school students, which can also better cultivate students’ analytical problem-solving skills and enhance their logical thinking. However, only a part of schools and students are currently learning this programming, and it is not popular enough yet. Moreover, if the teaching is mainly based on the teacher’s explanation, it will be boring. Therefore, there is a need to explore the teaching based on game design and combine teaching with fun, so that learning can become a more acceptable “game” for students, making the classroom atmosphere more active and improving the teaching quality of the classroom.},

Second, STEM curricula and challenges students from extremely rural communities face in identifying with these rigorous programs. The work of influential researchers in student transition and retention along with contextual findings from a large, rural state in the Rocky Mountain region informed the redesign of an engineering college's outreach program. This paper has two purposes. First, it details how established theories combined with research findings and assessment can create robust models to support keeping recruitment programs relevant. Second, it provides an example of how a model was developed and then used to redesign and assess an outreach program using college peer mentors to support high school-aged students interested in engineering and computing disciplines.},

  abstract={In this paper, we create a learning path and curate projects that let students learn certain computational concepts in a consistent way that bridges story, conversation, visual programming, and text-based programming. Our approach is to provide young children with both visual and text-based programming materials that are directly associated with the computational logic in some selected children’s daily dialogues and stories. We demonstrate this combo-design idea with examples of roleplaying, Snap! program, and Python code. Our design pattern and examples could be adapted to other suitable children’s activities in different school settings on a variety of technology platforms.},

This can help the learners who understand definitions of the concepts poorly. We present two visual simulators for demonstrating concept properties and domain laws, implemented as web applications. They can be used to study programming, enabling trial-and-error learning, supported by the error messages, explaining why the user's action was wrong.},

  abstract={This study explores the impact of online collaborative knowledge construction on Deeper Learning among university students. Utilizing Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), we examined interaction behaviors and cognitive development in a foundational computer science course. Data were collected from a Chinese university over nine weeks, involving two experimental phases. The analysis categorized students into core and peripheral groups based on centrality metrics, revealing significant differences in their engagement and learning levels. Core group members demonstrated higher cognitive development and problem-solving abilities, with dense connections in higher-order cognitive stages. In contrast, peripheral group members showed limited interaction and basic cognitive outcomes. The findings emphasize the critical role of collaboration and communication in fostering Deeper Learning, suggesting the need for educational institutions to adopt new teaching methods and technologies. By promoting high-order cognition and collaborative learning, educators can enhance students' critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving skills, ultimately contributing to a dynamic and enriched learning environment.},

  abstract={Learning to use computational tools is a critical aspect of many first-year engineering courses. Students in these courses can have varying degrees of prior exposure to computational tools and often exhibit a wide range of intrinsic motivation for learning these skills. Interviews with first-year engineering students were conducted to study the degree to which motivation correlated with intended major within engineering. The pilot round of interviews was conducted in the spring of 2021. This pilot study used the same data set of 8 interviews to progressively refine both the survey and interview collection in the 2021 – 2022 academic year. This paper will review the results of the pilot study and detail the process used to develop and use the finalized protocol and coding schemes for a planned series of 20 interviews in Summer 2022. While this technique developed because of limited data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been beneficial to the researcher and may provide guidance for future researchers.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work-in-progress, innovative practice paper describes the design and implementation of a computer programming project that encouraged students to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT). This innovative practice was implemented at a state university in an introduction to programming course. Course assessments included weekly homework assignments, an open-ended project, one quiz, and three midterm exams. Students were explicitly told in class and in the syllabus that no AI was allowed for weekly homework assignments; however, students were encouraged to use AI for the open-ended project. This decision was made because the problems on weekly assignments were more structured and could be easily solved by AI tools. In comparison, the learning objective of the project was focused on code design with open-ended requirements making it harder for AI to provide workable code. Students who reported using AI indicated that they used it to help start the project and/or a piece of the project and to aid in debugging or finding errors. Project grades were similar to grades seen in previous years for similar projects; however, grades on midterm two, which occurred after the project, were surprisingly higher than the grades for midterm one and higher than exam grades from previous years on similar topics. At this point, we do not know if/how the project contributed to these improved exam scores. Given the success of the project in its first implementation, Dr. E plans to use the assignment in future semesters. Additionally, Dr. C plans to collect data to begin exploring how the use of AI tools in this open-ended project supported students' learning and understanding of principles in the course.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed rapid and significant changes upon education systems. Most educational institutions transferred abruptly from traditional face-to-face delivery to distance learning formats through virtual classrooms. As a result of this shift, many faculty members have faced challenges in keeping their students engaged during lectures. Gamification is often proposed as a promising solution to enhance student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes attainment. This study investigates the effectiveness of the gamification mechanism on undergraduate students in a computer programming course using Kahoot! and Nearpod during distance learning. The findings of the study show that there is some correlation between student engagement, learning motivation, academic performance, and the use of gamification.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={184-188},
  abstract={This paper presents the design of a browser-based Arduino programming tool and learning management system (LMS), CASMM, that offers end-to-end support for learners utilizing Chromebooks in a classroom environment. This tool aims to support learners through the entire process of coding and using Arduinos in group projects at scale in formal classrooms. The novelty of this tool and its discussion for the VL/HCC community lies in the design and customization of this tool to meet real world constraints of formal classrooms. In addition, it encourages expansion of who we consider users and requires inclusion of where and how learning takes place to truly support human-centered development of programming tools. In this paper, we shift the focus from individual users to multiple groups of student users and 1–3 teachers/mentors in a classroom environment. In particular, this paper aims to make explicit the unique needs of teachers and students who may have limited technology expertise both in coding and using Arduinos in formal classroom environments, the human and technological constraints of a formal classroom and features we've designed into CASMM to address these needs. Through this paper, we aim to spark discussion about the human-centered requirements of these users and how tools that support learners end-to-end in the development process may be necessary to truly provide accessible programming languages and environments for a wide range of novices (i.e., students, classroom teachers, and college mentors/volunteers).},

  abstract={With the development of science and technology, many industries begin to use computer technology to improve work efficiency. From the facts of many practices, we can see that computer technology is a good technology for many industries and can bring many benefits to the industry. Computer technology is also deepening into legal practice. In legal practice, modeling, simulation and other calculation methods can be used to analyze legal relations, so that legal information can be transformed from traditional analysis to an information and intelligent system with higher efficiency and accuracy. The inclusion classification in legal procedures can be simply summarized as a model, and the eigenvalue table structure is built to make the case enter the computer into data that can be calculated and judged. This method simplifies the case trial and makes the case context clearer. The deep integration of Computational Thinking and legal thinking is conducive to enrich and develop the basic theory of law, improve the scientificity and coordination of various departments in the judicial system, and improve the efficiency of the judicial system. Computer technology plays a positive role in improving legislative and judicial efficiency, coping with and avoiding technical risks.},

  year={2019},

  abstract={This study explores interactions between computational thinking, gender and engineering identity among biomedical engineering undergraduate students. Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, `engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student's perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is successfully intervening in areas such as education, health and industry. In education, AI is being used to improve educational processes. UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium, but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational thinking and critical thinking. The present Systematic Literature Review was developed according to the methodological guidelines proposed by Barbara Kitchenham, with the objective of identifying how AI teaching-learning processes are carried out from early ages. Sixty-four studies were obtained between 2016-2021, where eleven countries are identified with AI teaching initiatives, through workshops, courses and projects to update their curricula; machine learning and educational robotics are the two branches linked to AI that are currently taught to children and adolescents.},

  abstract={Students' emotional state plays a vital role in learning. In this study, we examined the emotional changes of 69 students during the lectures of the C Language Programming Foundation and Computational Thinking in central China. This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8–10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively.},

  abstract={Minecraft is one of the most popular games among youth today, experiencing sales over 100 million worldwide and channels on YouTube generating over 47 billion views. Our interest in the game environment is due to its innate computational mechanics that integrate logic, design, and scripting elements. Because of these traits, many organizations and schools are looking to incorporate Minecraft into their curriculum to support computational thinking and computational practices. However, there are challenges surrounding the distribution and availability of individuals who possess the technical and computational expertise needed to support these opportunities. In this poster we introduce the DYN Minecraft Server project. The project is designed to address barriers of entry for adults at schools and youth-serving organizations who want to provide computing-related learning opportunities to diverse youth. We worked with families, city organizations, mentors, and youth to modify the commercially available Minecraft to support adults who may have limited expertise in computing or Minecraft, yet wish to use the platform in order to teach computational content The modifications include the integration of an information network that promotes STEM learning opportunities that are available throughout the city. We discuss our design process, designed activities and interfaces, and feedback from youth, partners, and mentors using the system.},

  abstract={This paper discusses how a connection between programming and creative work in terms of visual and interactive art can be of interest in the educational context of learning programming. There are strong indications that a creative approach in programming allows to pay attention to institutional and social requirements concerning computer science education. This includes the students' interest and motivation as well as their performance and knowledge acquisition. Even though, this has been discussed before, this paper presents a first basic structure of a didactic concept, enabling an integration of creative coding as an additional path for teaching computer science in schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Taking existing approaches into account, basic ideas of creative coding are identified and connected to the concepts of Computational Thinking.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of science and technology over the world, programming education has shown as a trend in decades. Programming courses have been offered in primary education to promote students’ computational thinking skills. However, teaching and learning programming in primary schools involve different knowledge including complex mathematical concepts and programming syntax. Also, traditional teaching methods may not effectively cater for students’ individual needs and learning trajectories. Thus, learning difficulties are common among students. Teachers keep examining innovation on programming education to improve their teaching. This study investigated used a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students in Macao, to compare the influence of two pedagogical strategies, flipped classroom and traditional teaching, in students’ learning achievements. The major findings of the study showed that the experimental group in flipped classroom had significantly higher learning achievements than the control group in the programming course. Moreover, the students in the flipped classroom showed a significant effective mastery of more complex programming concepts, such as conditions and loops.},

  abstract={How can learning be computed? Curriculum, using visual language as the motivational context with embedded computer science content was utilized in one college computer science class and two middle school technology classes. From the data collected in these three classes over the course of a semester, associated learning progressions were computed from several computational thinking patterns. By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged. We believe that the more obvious indications give credence to the less obvious, and hence the measurement tool. This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts. Although this is just the first "outing" of this tool these results strongly indicate that the tool provides an accurate measure of the concept, in this case, learning accumulation or transfer. The Scalable Game Design (SGD) project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve computer science interest in middle schools. The goal of SGD is to use visual language programming software (Agentsheets) to introduce a more positive image of computer science through a game design course.},

  abstract={Lacking student preparation before class has been the most commonly identified challenge when adopting the flipped classroom approach. In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented. A statistically significant difference was discovered between the first and third cohorts (t = -15.06, p<; 0.00001), and between the second and third cohorts (t = _27.02, p<; 0.00001) of the course in lecture video access rates.},

Findings indicated a competent level in Professional Engagement, yet they revealed that teachers are still at initial stages regarding the integration of digital tools in teaching and the use of open educational resources. Although variables like gender, age, and academic background showed no significant differences, it was noted that both the technological infrastructure of institutions and support for professional development positively impact digital competences.

  abstract={In 2021, the first year of Metaverse, Web3.0 ecosystems emerged as a result of the Internet's de-centralized evolution. In the Web3.0 space, there has been a very active advancement of the generative art non-fungible token, which is a special asset stored on a blockchain that allows creators to buy and sell assets and verify ownership. In other words, as it reconstructs the interpersonal relationship, the generative art non-fungible token must carry cultural values to be meaningful, and waiting to observe artificial intelligence generative art in the future requires a new mindset and posture. Design thinking is a design-based approach to solve today's complex problems. This study thus addresses the new Web3.0 ecosystem and introduces environmental sustain ability issues and computational thinking in the form of generative art to discuss the possibilities of future design thinking. By linking with social information, this study also creates an intersection with heterogeneous knowledge and stimulates a new thinking pattern that is different from previous ones. This project of design and research in the Metaverse virtual environment is still a novel topic. Reviewing past literature indicates that relevant papers are very scarce, and more resources are urgently needed for research in this field.},

  abstract={Gamification is a blooming technology that transforms stereotypical academics into interesting game-like elements. Through gamification, educators motivate the students to involve themselves in the game design for entertainment and adopt the features of the game design in an educational setting for enhanced learning. This work focuses on an educational digital game for learning sorting algorithms and concepts from data structures. The game is designed based on constructivism learning theory and the MDA framework, aiming to promote active and student-centered learning. The game challenges players to rearrange a sequence of unsorted aliens by using a set of commands, such as comparing, swapping, and moving. The game also records players’ actions and performance through log data, which can be analyzed for learning behavior, and outcomes. It describes the game design and development process, as well as the potential benefits and limitations of using the game in computer science education, and also discusses how the game can facilitate the development of computational thinking skills such as problem formulation, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, and generalization.},

  abstract={An increasing number of tools have been created to assist students in learning mathematics. Robots have been regarded as an especially powerful tool to help students master mathematics since students can simultaneously learn mathematics, programming, robotic control, and computational thinking. Although a number of educational robots and curricula have been developed, some of them do not comply with math standards, so they are primarily suitable for after-school programs, camps, or workshops. Students might not be able to focus on learning mathematics now that writing a program might be difficult for them due to debugging. In this paper, mathematics curricula that meet math standards are developed with a block-based programming platform, Roboblocky. Linkbots are utilized as robots in the curricula to teach and learn mathematics in school settings. Students learn mathematics by observing the motions of robots in simulations or on real mats. Most students improved greatly in mathematics after using the curricula. It is expected that the curricula based on Roboblocky will continue to be improved to enable more middle and high school students to be successful in learning mathematics.},

  abstract={Nowadays, there has been a rapid evolution and transformation of technology. Many innovative technologies have emerged including artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, automation systems, quantum computing, big data, blockchain, etc. These emerging technologies have also transformed our lifestyles. This transformation has then inevitably required a new set of skills; Computational Thinking/Logical Thinking which can be compiled into Coding skills. Several novel educational media and teaching materials have been promoted. Current educational kits in the market can be classified into 3 main categories. These structures vary from physical kits vs virtual kits vs hybrid kits, while coding styles vary from block-based vs text-based. This paper presents an educational multi-purpose kit for coding and robotic design which has a hybrid kits structure with block-based coding style. Its connection scheme has been designed as wired/wireless plug-and-play via magnetic. The implemented prototype could be resilient for various learning activities, including emulating three (touch, hearing and sight) out of five basic human senses via sensors and actuators. A use case on shape recognition, using computer vision, has been illustrated to show how the implemented system works.},

  abstract={The “C Language Programming” course is a specialized elective for 33 non-computer undergraduate majors in 9 faculties of our university. It aims to develop students ’ computational thinking. And it aims to make student’s ability to solve practical problems using computer programs. In response to the pain points of “significant differences in student basic knowledge and difficulty in unifying teaching difficulty” in teaching content, teaching evaluation methods, and teacher-student teaching and learning, the teaching method based on TPACK has been adopted. Following the educational philosophy of “output oriented and continuous improvement”, the subject teaching knowledge has been integrated. With the help of modern information technology, based on various integrated teaching modes of online and offline, and of class and extracurricular, a corresponding teaching environment has been constructed, curriculum ideological and political education has been strengthened, and a diversified assessment and evaluation system has been constructed. Based on the above research, multiple disciplinary competition awards have been obtained. Teaching practice has proven that the above teaching methods effectively solve pain points. The transformation has been achieved from traditional classrooms to smart classrooms, from knowledge classrooms to ability classrooms, and from indoctrination classrooms to innovative classrooms. The students ’ learning interest and self-learning abilities have been enhanced. The students’ ability to apply knowledge, solve problems, perform hands-on operations, and cooperate in teams have been developed. The students' patriotism has been cultivated. The correct life values of students has been shaped. The students' innovative thinking and determination to challenge themselves have been stimulated.},

  abstract={The Ministry of Information Technology, Information and Communication, under the aegis of the Mauritian government aims at developing digital learning to improve the potential of Mauritian students for the future. As the country posits itself as a cyber-island with a fully developed information technology hub, it has become imperative to think about leveraging the teaching of computer science in lower secondary schools (Grades 7-9). So far, this has been limited to basic courses in computing that are essentially theory focused. This paper states that students at this stated level need to develop `computational thinking' so that they are ready for the workplace and will effectively enter the digital world. It limits itself to two key variables resource leveraging and teaching computing. In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum. In the teaching area, the paper suggests that a combination of teaching programming, inclusion and informal learning will be the possibilities to accompany students overcome the digital divide and get the opportunity to become effective as learners and trained ICT students to serve their nation.},

  abstract={Dynamic geometry systems (DGS) are widely used in mathematics education to enhance students' thinking skills through geometric exploration. Integrating programming into DGS fosters both mathematical and computational thinking. However, research on reverse debugging design for programmable dynamic geometry systems is limited, and existing systems fail to meet the needs for operation reversal. To address this, this paper proposes a programming environment that supports reverse debugging, aiming to overcome the limitations of current programmable dynamic geometry systems in debugging. We abstracted dynamic geometry operations and defined three types of drawing instructions. To ensure sequential execution and debugging, we designed a debuggable sequential execution algorithm, followed by a reverse debugging control algorithm. The effectiveness of the system is verified by experiments.},

  abstract={This research to practice work in progress has two main objectives: i) the improvement of interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes in an integrated course of informatics in high school course and; ii) turning students into learners by the designing and development of innovative features for m-learning applications. Such objectives are integrated each other, since the improvement in the teaching and learning processes will not be restricted in the proposal and use of a practical framework for the improvement of students' skills in the computational thinking, but also in the use of the m-learning features and applications to improve educational issues faced by both students and teachers. In this perspective, active-learning and problem-based learning theories were considered to support the proposal of a series of activities composing a framework to be adopted to achieve the target objectives. The interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes improvement has its roots at the proposal of solutions for problems into disciplines of high school curricula through the innovative m-learning features to be designed and developed by the students. In this paper it is discussed the motivations about the proposal of this project, the teaching and learning implications in the context of a integrated course of informatics in high school course, its planning and a pilot conduction of mainly initial activities with the volunteers students. Such activities include: (a) the identification of problems and the planning of solutions based on m-learning features; (b) the design and development phases of an initial set features; and (c) a preliminary evaluation of usability of some mockups of m-learning application. At the end, the identified evidence are discussed, mainly those related with the implications for the interdisciplinary scenario for the teaching and learning processes, the initial identification of benefits in the perspective of the participation of students as learners and the future work, as well.},

  abstract={How do Oprah, the multimedia mogul, and Edison, the inventor of the telephone, both inspire teachers and students to learn computational thinking? A CS/CT focused module was developed by two grade 4 teachers that would introduce culturally relevant role models to students in an urban school district. The module engages students through a “Choose Your Own Adventure” activity focusing on perseverance and conditionals. Students create Scratch projects, using a Makey Makey, to model what would happen if one of their historical role models gave up on their dreams. This module is just one example of the nineteen modules created by members of CSforALL Springfield, a Research Practice Partnership working with the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts. The partnership allows for collaboration between educators from Springfield, MA Public Schools and Researchers from the University. We will spotlight this module to show how the module was designed and taught to make it an engaging, equitable learning experience for all students and share their learning outcomes along the way. Our goal is to share how we designed and integrated culturally responsive Computer Science curriculum at the elementary level that will ensure equitable learning for all students. Our goal is to show how we engaged dyads in a design based collaborative process to produce a module for their grade level.},

  abstract={The Department of Computer Science at Hampton University was awarded the HBCU-UP TIP Project to reform three gateway courses and implement an intensive computing summer bridge program (SBP) in an effort to improve student academic performance and increase retention and graduation rates in the major. By integrating Computational Thinking into lower-level courses, the proposed project also seeks to strengthen Computer Science students and better prepare them to meet the modern demands in the field. In the first year of the project there have been several changes to the curriculum content of the gateway courses as well as the implementation of the summer pre-college program. The summer 2014 was the first computing pre-college program. There were nineteen participants currently in the summer program. The students were engaged and excited to be a part of this program. The Computer Science Seminar course served as the initiative for a supplemental undergraduate research award request. The course focused not only ensuring the students understand computer science as a field of study, but also how computer science impacts all fields of study and everything in their daily lives. There were several speakers, FBI, Industry, University faculty, and previous graduates. The initial results has been extremely rewarding as we noticed from their performance in the first semester program course, CS1. This poster will discuss the curriculum we used during the summer program, sample exercises, feedback from students as well as lesson learnt for us to improve next year program.},

  abstract={The STEM methodology has been applied in different study approaches, covering different areas such as arts, internet of things, computational thinking, among others. In this paper, two necessary approaches are addressed for the implementation of a closed-loop control system. The first approach (programming) is directly related to the software implementation and the second approach addresses the hardware instrumentation part. Both approaches are developed in a practical teaching case, from a STEM Maker workshop which consisted of 15 sessions with duration 2 hours each one. Each session consisted of 4 stages: Stage 1 (Theoretical concepts), Stage 2 (Practical Example), Stage 3 (Practice) and Stage 4 (challenge). Through these four stages, the development of skills of the attendees in the areas of programming and electronics was encouraged, applying the STEM Maker strategy. From some evaluation instruments, data was collected about the development of skills of the assistants in the implementation of software and hardware instrumentation, acquired in the STEM Maker workshop. The results indicated that approximately 70% of the workshop attendees developed the necessary skills to propose solutions to problems in their current context where the application of programming and/or electronics intervenes. The product obtained from the practice is described as a temperature control which integrates a feedback signal, this system has a wide field of applications which allowed the students of the STEM Maker workshop to achieve a project related to the individual context of each one.},

However, there is little work focus on the evaluation metrics for block-based python code. The past block-oriented evaluation metrics based on Computational Thinking (CT) were not language-oriented, and program volume was often ignored. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metrics for block-based python code, which combines the CT dimensions and program volume. The experimental results show that the correlations between the proposed metrics and Halstead, McCabe complexity algorithms are both above 0.7, which is higher than Dr. Scratch.},

  abstract={Objective: The objective of this paper is to present preliminary work on the development of an EduChatBot tool and the measurement of the effects of its use aimed at providing effective feedback to programming course students. This bot, hereinafter referred to as tutorBot+, was constructed based on chatGPT3.5 and is tasked with assisting and providing timely positive feedback to students in computer science programming courses at UCSC. Methods/Analysis: The proposed method consists of four stages: (1) Immersion in the feedback and Large Language Models (LLMs) topic; (2) Development of tutorBot+ prototypes in both non-conversational and conversational versions; (3) Experiment design; and (4) Intervention and evaluation. The first stage involves a literature review on feedback and learning, the use of intelligent tutors in the educational context, as well as the topics of LLMs and chatGPT. The second and third stages detail the development of tutorBot+ in its two versions, and the final stage lays the foundation for a quasi-experimental study involving students in the curriculum activities of Programming Workshop and Database Workshop, focusing on learning outcomes related to the development of computational thinking skills, and facilitating the use and measurement of the tool’s effects. Findings: The preliminary results of this work are promising, as two functional prototypes of tutorBot+ have been developed for both the non-conversational and conversational versions. Additionally, there is ongoing exploration into the possibility of creating a domain-specific model based on pretrained models for programming, integrating tutorBot+ with other platforms, and designing an experiment to measure student performance, motivation, and the tool’s effectiveness.},

  abstract={The programming language Python is simple and easy to learn and is used for students with no prior background in programming. Several colleges and universities teach Python to students who are learning a programming language for the first time. In this paper, we present a curricular model for introducing, through active learning strategies, data analytics concepts and applications into an introductory computer science course for non-majors. We have designed the course to use a variety of hands-on laboratory projects that use the Python programming language and associated tools. While introducing students to an important research area, we believe the use of these projects improves students’ learning experiences, enables them to apply and relate fundamental computational thinking concepts of algorithmic reasoning, data representation, and computational efficiency to data analytics problems. Assessment results show that introducing data analytics concepts and applications through active learning strategies enhanced students’ computing capability to solve problems.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on the characteristics of computer science general course, specifically the emphasis on comprehension and practical application in “Python Language Programming”. Combining the contemporary Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technology with the teaching philosophy of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate) in computer education, I propose the innovative AIGC-CDIO-OBE education model. Which can help students enhance computational thinking, design thinking, and programming skills in python language. Through teaching practices, the effectiveness and feasibility of this education model are demonstrated when compared to traditional teaching methods. Students have more interesting for learning, stronger motivation for coding, and stronger sense of achievement in their learning outcomes.},

  abstract={Summary <p>The age of AI will dramatically overhaul the workforce. By some accounts, AI will create more jobs than it destroys, but these jobs will require different skills and education levels than the ones displaced by automation. This chapter outlines how to reframe the purpose of education and the practices to ensure that students are prepared for whatever the world looks like as the age of AI develops. The AI&#x2010;driven workforce will require a mix of technical and soft skills. Integrating AI literacy into traditional subject areas will ensure that students can adapt what they are learning in any context they find themselves in. Computational thinking will be a vital skill, allowing students to design products and systems that build on AI and understand systems that others build. A key component for cultivating innovative and creative skills in the students will be a shift away from the compartmentalized structure of the school systems.</p>},

  abstract={Supported by a state grant, our team of researchers (consisting of both Computer Science faculty and Teacher Education faculty) is offering a series of Professional Development sessions to K-8 teachers. These Professional Development (or PD) sessions are meant to help K-8 teachers develop their understanding of core computing concepts (such as algorithms, programming, data analysis, and networks) and thereby develop strong computer science programs for their students. In order to offer effective and meaningful Professional Development (PD) sessions, our research team first intended to understand the perceptions and experiences of K-8 teachers about Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) education. This paper presents the results of a K-8 teacher survey that we conducted as a pre-cursor to our PD series. The results of this survey provided valuable insights about elementary and middle-school teachers' perceptions of computer science education, self-perception of their ability to teach and learn CS, and understanding of CS discipline and those who typically engage in CS activities. The impact of teachers' perceptions impact how leaders in education and the CS industry can meet the needs of teachers, who in turn can meet the growing demand of CS education in K-8 schools.},

  abstract={Although the research on digital gaming has recently shown that collaboration, problem solving and critical thinking are in evidence with K-12 students who design games; researchers still need to make the case that digital game design content meets rigorous new Common Core standards for Language Arts and mathematics. No class time will be devoted to game design unless proponents of digital gaming can develop and demonstrate this argument. This preliminary data focus on a feasibility implementation of an assessment designed to embed these standards. Three elementary level classroom teachers and their students used the process and demonstrated that (1) teachers can learn to design and use this process and (2) their students demonstrate elements of computational thinking that not only includes the Common Core standards but extends them.},

  abstract={A car moving at a speed of x mph, comes to a sudden halt after traveling y miles. What is the time taken by the car to reach z miles ahead of y? A high school student probably gets frustrated by questions like these on the ground that inquiries in arithmetic. The idea of implementing hacking on a smart car should improve student’s interest and motivate them to pursue careers in STEM-related areas. However, if the same example was demonstrated to them using a smart car prototype which was hacked, then there is a good chance they can get attracted towards Technology and Computing. When similar examples, involving the various other topics in their syllabus, are shown, they’ll probably get to see the real-life applications of the topics they study during high school and after that. This paper introduces a new attempt that aims at inclining the interest of high school students towards the courses in the STEM (which have an escalating carrier aspect), improving their computational thinking capability, and making them aware of today’s cybersecurity issues.},

  abstract={This paper provides the motivation for the design of a web-based planning tool called AgentDesign, a description of its components, and a discussion of elementary students' ability to use it for creating games. The planning tool presented in this paper was used to engage elementary students in an activity to design and then create a video game using an agent-based programming environment. The design of the planning tool was informed by prior research and literature on concept development. The tool scaffolded the design process by having students (1) describe their game, (2) identify agents, (3) describe agent behavior, and (4) use those descriptions to identify useful algorithms. The set of algorithms used were called computational thinking patterns (CTPs), and sample code was provided for each CTP to assist the programming process. From the information provided by the student a summary was created to show needed agents and helpful programming code.},

  abstract={Today, principles of finance are combined with advanced mathematical structures to form useful financial products, strategies and models that are tested and implemented with the use of advanced quantitative techniques. Use of computing technology is pervasive throughout this process. Quantitative and Computational Finance is an area referred to under a variety of names, for example, ‘computational finance’, ‘financial engineering’, and ‘mathematical finance’. But in all cases there is an effort that involves ‘financial’, ‘mathematical’, ‘quantitative’ and ‘computational’ thinking to build, test and implement models that are at the center of these financial activities. In the last decade Computational Finance (CF) has influenced the market place extensively with enormous impact on wealth building, employment opportunities, and tremendous economic growth. This field forms an ever-expanding part of the financial sector, in numerous ways today. The time is, therefore, ripe now to bring together researchers in the areas of finance using complicated financial models to solve computationally intensive problems and computer scientists having the resources and solution methodologies to solve such problems. The main goal of this workshop is to provide a timely forum for these two groups to exchange and disseminate new ideas, techniques, and research in computational finance. Strong discussions will follow the presentations and the experience could lead them into the formulation, implementation of the models used by the practitioners in financial sector. This workshop will be a first such effort in bringing together researchers in the areas of finance and advanced computing (i) who develop and employ parallel and distributed computing extensively (ii) at a venue where parallel, distributed, high performance computing is the fundamental thread of discussions and arguments.},

  abstract={Most of today's approaches to introductory computer science education reflect a 1970s view of computer science: students typically create single-threaded programs that do local IO. Some of the technologies used within these educational experiences include post-70s visual language elements like blocks to assist with the syntax of programming, but the semantics of the programming have generally remained frozen in time. Yet, the field of computer science has progressed enormously since the 1970s: multi-core computing, distributed systems, and machine learning are now ubiquitous, and have deep philosophical and practical ramifications for computer science education, including our definitions of what computational thinking is, and for how we design new programming languages, including visual languages. I will compare the current state of the art of novice programming tools and theories to the current state of computer science, and describe how new conceptual frameworks and visual programming tools could support contemporary computer science education.},

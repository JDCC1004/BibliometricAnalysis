  abstract={A dynamic Computational Thinking resolution can be likely in a 6G environment by way of Green-IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI), important parts of computational thinking. This order requires lowering difficult problems to tinier, more controllable parts and recognizing patterns and friendships at intervals in miscellaneous parts. Machine intelligence approaches concentrate on algorithms capable of learning from data, making judgments and predictions, and executing complex tasks beyond explicit programming. To appreciate the far-reaching quantities of data presented by 6G-connected schemes, computational inference and machine intelligence can be used for the Green-IoT. This has the potential to reinforce the computerization of many processes and bring about a smarter and more efficient use of possessions. Computational thinking that combines Green-IoT, AI, and 6G sciences can transform many areas, including education, and reinforce society's lives through the production of brisker, more adept, and more tailor-made uses and services. The research has been started by outlining key limits utilizing Green-IoT-authorized sensor electronics in the framework of 5G and 6G surroundings, as well as Artificial Intelligence, in this place study's review on computational thinking. In the subsequent section, delineate the fundamental structural requirements for a digital thinking paradigm centered on artificial intelligence and the Net of Things, significant aspects of prospective beneficial applications, and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each within the context of shared resources. Lastly, several security risks to an AI-based architecture that might compromise the system's ability to provide the computational thinking services that social media platforms need},

It can be found that the motivation of high computational thinking learners increases more significantly with corrective feedback, while the motivation of low computational thinking learners decreases with corrective feedback and increases with prompting feedback.

  abstract={The information society is a reality nowadays, and computational thinking has become a relevant competence for everybody, regardless of age, social status, and primary activity. Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students’ autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper describes the readiness of pre-service mathematics teachers to incorporate Scratch, a block-based programming application, into mathematics instruction, focusing on their knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Given the rapid technological advancements, leveraging technology in mathematics education is crucial in fostering proficient problem-solving abilities among students. Consequently, computational thinking is recognized as a vital 21st-century competency, a transferable skill for effective problem-solving methods. The study underscores the importance of integrating Scratch, a supportive tool in computational thinking, into mathematics education. However, to integrate this application into mathematics education, pre-service teachers must be prepared to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills and to be ready to accept its use in teaching in the future. The construction of knowledge by pre-service mathematics teachers regarding the Scratch application is examined through the lens of social constructivism, which emphasizes knowledge construction through experience and social interaction. A purposive sample of 60 first- and second-year students participated in an online survey. The sample selection involving two groups aimed to identify significant differences in pre-service teachers' readiness levels across gender, study year, and academic achievement. The findings revealed limited proficiency among pre-service mathematics teachers in utilizing Scratch, particularly regarding its integration into mathematics instruction. Several factors contribute to the deficiency in skills among pre-service mathematics teachers in navigating the Scratch application, including requiring additional time to grasp the programming language employed in the application, challenges in arranging blocks to achieve desired outputs, and struggles in rectifying syntax errors. However, there was a positive attitude towards the application, indicating a strong inclination to enhance their skills. The study also found no significant differences in demographic variables such as gender, study year, or academic achievement, but a slight correlation exists between knowledge, attitudes, and academic achievement. Investigating pre-service teachers' readiness to integrate Scratch into mathematics instruction sheds light into the intersection between mathematics pedagogy and computational thinking. This intersection underscores the importance of integrating programming tools like Scratch into mathematics education to cultivate computational thinking skills. Additionally, the findings contribute to the broader discourse on the role of technology in education and highlight the need for enhanced training and support for pre-service teachers in leveraging technology effectively for instructional purposes.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become an essential skill nowadays. Many educational institutions around the world have adopted computational thinking as an elementary or complementary subject in their teaching schedules. One of the approaches that is efficient in teaching and learning computational thinking has been visual programming. However, like other applications used daily, visual programming tools can be a limiting factor for the blind in learning computational thinking. This work aims to present the iVProg4all, an accessible visual programming system based on forms. A preliminary study was carried out to test the usability of iVProg4all and accessibility with a blind user. The results show that, although some usability issues need to be fixed, the system proved accessible for blind people.},

  abstract={Many block-based programming environments have proven to be effective at engaging novices in learning programming. However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. The paper presents NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={112605-112625},
  abstract={In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been employed significantly in different domains of computing education. Nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. However, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing LLM behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness. The finding also reports multiple research directions that can be considered in future research related to LLMs in computing education.},

  abstract={This Innovative-Practice Full Paper presents the curriculum development of an introductory course in programming and data science for postdoctoral researchers (PDRs) in the biosciences. The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education.},

  abstract={In a world in a continuous and rapid change, it is absolutely necessary for our students to keep up with the rapid progress of new technologies: Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) etc. The rapid evolution and diversification of these emerging technologies has recently led to their introduction into the educational offer of the school curriculum for the gymnasium. The discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has already been implemented, a discipline that involves both the formation of skills to use new technologies and the formation of computational thinking necessary for the efficient and intelligent use of these technologies. In order to teach and learn Physics from a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) educational perspective, we initiated optional school courses of IoT, Robotics and AI (approached through Machine Learning). These courses stimulate, at the level of students, computational thinking, creativity and innovation and lead, from an interdisciplinary perspective, to the development of emerging specializations such as Mathematics-Physics-Automation, Mathematics-Physics-Electronics, Mathematics-Physics-Informatics-Robotics etc. In this paper we presented a method of approaching, in the school educational space, the study of wireless communication technologies between smart devices, through an Educational Robotics project. The project consisted of creating a wireless controlled mobile robotic platform (robot car) via a Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino Uno board.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Personal health tracking devices and internet-based digital platforms with the capacity to collect, aggregate, and store data at massive scales are examples of tools that have broadened priorities in computing to include data science. In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand “big data.” This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, “Coding Like a Data Miner” (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of “big data” sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions.},

  abstract={In the digital age, programming education has become increasingly important, even in primary schools. However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success.},

  title={Enculturation of Students to Engineering and COVID's Impact Associated}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as ASEE or IEEE. Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model.},

  abstract={Aiming at the main problems of the traditional C++ course teaching, in this paper, a C++ teaching innovation model based on the concept of the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and the integration of the ACM competition and teaching is proposed based on the background of the era of the New Engineering. It takes the problem-solving and the live code as the main teaching line, takes the information technology teaching as the means, promotes the students’ integration of the theory and practice by the ACM/ICPC competition, and organically combines the process assessment and the final assessment, and implements the diversified assessment forms. For theoretical teaching, the authors put forward an innovative model of C++ teaching based on the concept of the OBE and the combination of the ACM competition and teaching. For practical teaching, the authors designed a keyword-oriented OJ system to address the problem of the large differences in the programming ability among the students. For the course assessment, the authors designed a C++ multi-topic intelligent online examination system. The results of more than ten years’ practical teaching show that the innovative model of the C++ teaching based on the OBE concept and the ACM competition has effectively cultivated the students’ computational thinking and significantly improved their programming ability and innovation ability. In the past ten years, our students won many ACM/ICPC prizes. At present, this teaching innovation model has been effectively promoted and applied in three campuses of our university. It has a certain leading and exemplary role in cultivating the top-notch innovative talents in the field of the computer science with the excellent professional programming ability, computational thinking, the national sentiment, the global vision and the all-round development.},

However, there is a lack of adequate and in-depth discussion on how robotics should be implemented in the classroom to effectively foster the development of computational thinking in K-8 education, presenting technical concepts in a reflective manner that connects to the everyday lives of the school community. This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach that integrates robotics and cryptography within a historical context of a city. The methodology was applied to primary education teachers, allowing them to identify relevant concepts within these themes, integrating technologies with local history.},

  abstract={Nurturing programming talent early is crucial in today's digital world, especially in K-12 education, underscored by the rise of programming competitions for younger students. However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.},

  abstract={In Experience and Education, Dewey argued that humankind is “given to formulating its beliefs in terms of Either-Ors, between which it recognizes no intermediate possibilities.” Not surprisingly, educational computing is no exception. One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing.},

  abstract={Programming and robot building are two crucial components in an AI curriculum, while students' learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement are important dimensions to measure students' learning outcomes. In previous teaching practice, virtual simulation platforms are often used as teaching aids, and the operational difficulty of the platforms may reduce students' interest in learning, thus lowering the learning effect. Therefore, based on the 5E teaching model, this study combines gamification elements with virtual simulation integrated learning to explore its effects on the three dimensions of students' learning goal attainment, computational thinking improvement, and autonomous learning improvement.},

  abstract={This research addresses the integration of Machine Learning (ML) into K-12 education, which is increasingly recognized as essential for preparing students for the AI-driven world. However, the current landscape of ML implementation and its impact in K-12 classrooms remain areas of active investigation. In recent years, the integration of ML techniques into K-12 computing education has become increasingly prevalent, reflecting the growing importance of AI-driven and data-driven approaches across computing fields. This study addresses the gaps in understanding how intuition and agency develop in the context of ML systems within K-12 education, while also examining the emerging trajectories, challenges, and opportunities in teaching ML in K-12 education. Motivated by the need to assess the effectiveness and challenges of ML integration in K-12 settings, this survey-based study aims to provide insights into pedagogical approaches, tools utilized, and teachers' perceptions of ML in education. Drawing upon the importance of early ML exposure in developing computational thinking and fostering data literacy, this study seeks to address gaps such as age-appropriate content, teacher preparedness, and ethical considerations. By systematically reviewing existing research and surveying educators, this study aims to offer valuable insights into effective practices, identify tools available, and highlight areas for further research on the responsible implementation of ML in K-12 settings. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding gender-based differences in ML education. It briefly presents gender-based results obtained from surveys and data analysis, suggesting the need for tailored approaches to ML education that address potential gender-based barriers and biases. Additionally, the study discusses the paradigm shift required to successfully integrate ML into K-12 computing curricula, advocating for embracing ML as a fundamental component of future computing education. Ultimately, this study aims to inform computing educators and policymakers about the challenges and opportunities associated with ML education in K-12 settings, laying the groundwork for fostering ML literacy and computational thinking skills among K-12 students.},

  abstract={Nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. The project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of STEM Education with using IoT and Artificial Intelligence.},

  abstract={In this work in progress paper we present an example of innovative practice in organizing informal STEM education workshops with young children. The workshops were divided into two learning scenarios, unplugged programming and hands-on robot play. Unplugged programming encourages understanding of the core concepts of programming such as algorithms and computational thinking rather than focusing on the programming language. In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops. Combining unplugged activities with robots helps bridging the gap between imagination and reality, therefore improving learning.},

  abstract={Educational robotics is a practice that has been disseminated in Brazil and in the world, allowing the inclusion of technology in the school environment through stimulating pedagogical activities for students, making them practice teamwork, fine motor coordination, and computational thinking, among other benefits. For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community.},

  abstract={Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.},

Computer technology is also deepening into legal practice. In legal practice, modeling, simulation and other calculation methods can be used to analyze legal relations, so that legal information can be transformed from traditional analysis to an information and intelligent system with higher efficiency and accuracy. The inclusion classification in legal procedures can be simply summarized as a model, and the eigenvalue table structure is built to make the case enter the computer into data that can be calculated and judged. This method simplifies the case trial and makes the case context clearer. The deep integration of Computational Thinking and legal thinking is conducive to enrich and develop the basic theory of law, improve the scientificity and coordination of various departments in the judicial system, and improve the efficiency of the judicial system.

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is successfully intervening in areas such as education, health and industry. In education, AI is being used to improve educational processes. UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium, but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational thinking and critical thinking. The present Systematic Literature Review was developed according to the methodological guidelines proposed by Barbara Kitchenham, with the objective of identifying how AI teaching-learning processes are carried out from early ages. Sixty-four studies were obtained between 2016-2021, where eleven countries are identified with AI teaching initiatives, through workshops, courses and projects to update their curricula; machine learning and educational robotics are the two branches linked to AI that are currently taught to children and adolescents.},

  abstract={Students' emotional state plays a vital role in learning. In this study, we examined the emotional changes of 69 students during the lectures of the C Language Programming Foundation and Computational Thinking in central China. This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8–10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively.},

  abstract={This paper discusses how a connection between programming and creative work in terms of visual and interactive art can be of interest in the educational context of learning programming. There are strong indications that a creative approach in programming allows to pay attention to institutional and social requirements concerning computer science education. This includes the students' interest and motivation as well as their performance and knowledge acquisition. Even though, this has been discussed before, this paper presents a first basic structure of a didactic concept, enabling an integration of creative coding as an additional path for teaching computer science in schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Taking existing approaches into account, basic ideas of creative coding are identified and connected to the concepts of Computational Thinking.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of science and technology over the world, programming education has shown as a trend in decades. Programming courses have been offered in primary education to promote students’ computational thinking skills. However, teaching and learning programming in primary schools involve different knowledge including complex mathematical concepts and programming syntax. Also, traditional teaching methods may not effectively cater for students’ individual needs and learning trajectories. Thus, learning difficulties are common among students. Teachers keep examining innovation on programming education to improve their teaching. This study investigated used a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students in Macao, to compare the influence of two pedagogical strategies, flipped classroom and traditional teaching, in students’ learning achievements. The major findings of the study showed that the experimental group in flipped classroom had significantly higher learning achievements than the control group in the programming course. Moreover, the students in the flipped classroom showed a significant effective mastery of more complex programming concepts, such as conditions and loops.},

Utilizing the European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu), key areas such as Professional Engagement, Teaching and Learning, and Open Education were scrutinized. Findings indicated a competent level in Professional Engagement, yet they revealed that teachers are still at initial stages regarding the integration of digital tools in teaching and the use of open educational resources. Although variables like gender, age, and academic background showed no significant differences, it was noted that both the technological infrastructure of institutions and support for professional development positively impact digital competences. This underlines the importance of reinforcing educational policies related to training and digital resources to promote a substantial improvement in mathematics teaching, as a key factor for the development of students’ critical and computational thinking.},

  abstract={In 2021, the first year of Metaverse, Web3.0 ecosystems emerged as a result of the Internet's de-centralized evolution. In the Web3.0 space, there has been a very active advancement of the generative art non-fungible token, which is a special asset stored on a blockchain that allows creators to buy and sell assets and verify ownership. In other words, as it reconstructs the interpersonal relationship, the generative art non-fungible token must carry cultural values to be meaningful, and waiting to observe artificial intelligence generative art in the future requires a new mindset and posture. Design thinking is a design-based approach to solve today's complex problems. This study thus addresses the new Web3.0 ecosystem and introduces environmental sustain ability issues and computational thinking in the form of generative art to discuss the possibilities of future design thinking. By linking with social information, this study also creates an intersection with heterogeneous knowledge and stimulates a new thinking pattern that is different from previous ones. This project of design and research in the Metaverse virtual environment is still a novel topic. Reviewing past literature indicates that relevant papers are very scarce, and more resources are urgently needed for research in this field.},

Through gamification, educators motivate the students to involve themselves in the game design for entertainment and adopt the features of the game design in an educational setting for enhanced learning. This work focuses on an educational digital game for learning sorting algorithms and concepts from data structures. The game is designed based on constructivism learning theory and the MDA framework, aiming to promote active and student-centered learning. The game challenges players to rearrange a sequence of unsorted aliens by using a set of commands, such as comparing, swapping, and moving. The game also records players’ actions and performance through log data, which can be analyzed for learning behavior, and outcomes. It describes the game design and development process, as well as the potential benefits and limitations of using the game in computer science education, and also discusses how the game can facilitate the development of computational thinking skills such as problem formulation, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, and generalization.},

  abstract={An increasing number of tools have been created to assist students in learning mathematics. Robots have been regarded as an especially powerful tool to help students master mathematics since students can simultaneously learn mathematics, programming, robotic control, and computational thinking. Although a number of educational robots and curricula have been developed, some of them do not comply with math standards, so they are primarily suitable for after-school programs, camps, or workshops. Students might not be able to focus on learning mathematics now that writing a program might be difficult for them due to debugging. In this paper, mathematics curricula that meet math standards are developed with a block-based programming platform, Roboblocky. Linkbots are utilized as robots in the curricula to teach and learn mathematics in school settings. Students learn mathematics by observing the motions of robots in simulations or on real mats. Most students improved greatly in mathematics after using the curricula. It is expected that the curricula based on Roboblocky will continue to be improved to enable more middle and high school students to be successful in learning mathematics.},

Many innovative technologies have emerged including artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, automation systems, quantum computing, big data, blockchain, etc. These emerging technologies have also transformed our lifestyles. This transformation has then inevitably required a new set of skills; Computational Thinking/Logical Thinking which can be compiled into Coding skills. Several novel educational media and teaching materials have been promoted. Current educational kits in the market can be classified into 3 main categories. These structures vary from physical kits vs virtual kits vs hybrid kits, while coding styles vary from block-based vs text-based. This paper presents an educational multi-purpose kit for coding and robotic design which has a hybrid kits structure with block-based coding style. Its connection scheme has been designed as wired/wireless plug-and-play via magnetic. The implemented prototype could be resilient for various learning activities, including emulating three (touch, hearing and sight) out of five basic human senses via sensors and actuators. A use case on shape recognition, using computer vision, has been illustrated to show how the implemented system works.},

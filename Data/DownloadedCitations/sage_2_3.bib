abstract = {Social media platforms do not usually demonstrate responsibilities for published content. In recent years, an increasing number of individuals are now serving as sources of information that sparks public concern as it is considered to have lack of online quality control mechanisms. These mechanisms include the credentials of authors and information editorial teams. This paper aims to identify and develop an Islamic information credibility scale to examine the reliability of Islamic postings on social media, by acquiring the experts’ views and agreement on the elements in the proposed model by leveraging the Fuzzy Delphi process. A total of 15 experts from academic and related stakeholders participated in the verification of items through the questionnaire instrument’s 7-point linguistic scale by purposive sampling. Outcome of the study indicate that the appropriate criteria to evaluate the credibility of Islamic information on social media incline on the top four indicators, which are of the source of writing, accuracy, authority and authenticity of information. The result demonstrates the importance for referring to the source and content of information i.e., Quran and authentic hadith in the process to evaluate authentic Islamic information posting on social media, as opposed to the influence of the social environment. This study’s value lies in its contribution to the conceptualization and development of new Islamic information credibility scale through the screening and selection process of Fuzzy Delphi method approach. In future research, this scale should be explored to test new media credibility, as an emerging and promising approach to identifying and evaluating Islamic new media credibility.}

abstract = {The 10th annual International Conference of Students of Systematic Musicology (SysMus) took place on September 13–15, 2017, at Queen Mary University of London (UoL). The SysMus series has established itself as an international, student-run conference series aimed at introducing graduate students to networking and discussing their work in an academic conference environment. The term “Systematic Musicology,” first coined by Guido Adler (1885), nowadays covers a wide range of systematic or empirical approaches to theoretical, psychological, neuroscientific, ethnographic, and computational methodologies in music research. Presentations for SysMus17 focused on three central topics in relation to music: cognition and neuroscience, computation, and health and well-being. Each of these topics was the subject of workshops as well as keynotes by Prof. Lauren Stewart (Goldsmiths University of London and Music in the Brain Centre, Aarhus University), Prof. Elaine Chew and Dr. Marcus Pearce (both Queen Mary UoL), Dr. Daniel Müllensiefen (Goldsmiths UoL), and Prof. Aaron Williamon (Royal College of Music). Further presentations addressed issues relating to harmony and rhythm, musicians and performance, music and emotion, and sociology of music. This year’s conference brought together early-career researchers from the fields of musicology, psychology, and medicine, allowing them to socialize, share their work, and gain insight into interdisciplinary approaches to their subjects. SysMus17 was organized by students at Queen Mary’s Music Cognition Lab and was particularly marked by the series’ 10th anniversary, the live streaming of all presentations via social media, and a carbon-offsetting Green Initiative. The proceedings of SysMus17 will be available on demand from the conference website (www.sysmus17.qmul.ac.uk) and the videos will be made available for public access.}

By using an original model based on three conceptual lenses – materiality, performativity and reflexivity – this study examines the development of this form of journalism, the challenges it faces and its particularities in the context of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This research, therefore, offers unique insights from semi-structured interviews with data journalists and data editors based at, or working as freelancers for, the mainstream news organisations of these regions. The results suggest that data journalism in these devolved nations displays a distinctive character just as much as it reinforces the norms and rituals of the legacy organisations that pioneered this practice. While various models of data exploitation are tested, regional data journalists creatively circumvent generalised organisational struggles to lay the groundwork for their trade and professional community.}

Methods: A total of 1,159 students were recruited. Structural equation analysis was performed using IBM Amos Graphics®. Results: Excellent fit indices were obtained, forming a final scale composed of nine indicators and two factors. The first dimension was associated with cognitive skills and adaptability, grouping together the skills of finding meaning, adaptable thinking, and understanding management. The second dimension comprises collaborative skills, as social intelligence and virtual collaboration. Discussion: Collaboration skills were more developed within those undertaking PT, while baccalaureate students had more strongly developed mastery over new media. This scale allows to know effectively the development of the work skills set by the European Union in the 2030 horizon. These findings contribute interesting data regarding the development of training strategies to support insertion into the job market.}

We synthesized comparisons of game versus nongame conditions (i.e., media comparisons) and comparisons of augmented games versus standard game designs (i.e., value-added comparisons). We used random-effects meta-regression models with robust variance estimates to summarize overall effects and explore potential moderator effects. Results from media comparisons indicated that digital games significantly enhanced student learning relative to nongame conditions ( = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [0.19, 0.48], k = 57, n = 209). Results from value-added comparisons indicated significant learning benefits associated with augmented game designs ( = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [0.17, 0.51], k = 20, n = 40). Moderator analyses demonstrated that effects varied across various game mechanics characteristics, visual and narrative characteristics, and research quality characteristics. Taken together, the results highlight the affordances of games for learning as well as the key role of design beyond medium.}

abstract = {Background. Cybersecurity is of increasing importance in our interconnected world, yet the field has a growing workforce deficit and an underrepresentation of women and people of color. In an effort to address these issues, many digital games have been created to teach individuals about cybersecurity and keeping themselves, their data, and their networks safe. Intervention. We present the results of a systematic review of digital games related to cybersecurity as a means to understand how players are being introduced to cybersecurity in game-based contexts. Methods. Using a systematic search, we identified 181 games related to cybersecurity (either through content or aesthetics) by searching the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Steam, and the web broadly. Each game was played for up to an hour and characteristics such as the game story, game elements, and presentation of cybersecurity were gathered. Results. We found diverse conceptualizations of cybersecurity and of cybersecurity professionals. Further, the nature of games and the framing of cybersecurity varied by the platform and device on which the game was available (computer, mobile, or web). Web games were most likely to present cybersecurity as cyber safety and were more likely to be a gamified quiz or worksheet. Computer and mobile games tended to present cybersecurity through game aesthetics or deep content engagement. The games mirrored the underrepresentation of women and minoritized individuals in the field. Discussion. With the variety of digital cybersecurity games and the differences in games based on the platform on which the game is available, it is important game developers move beyond presenting cybersecurity through gamification and focusing on cyber safety. The current scope of cybersecurity games leaves room for the development of games focused on deeper content engagement with cybersecurity topics in an environment conducive to the broadening participation goals of the cybersecurity field.}

abstract = {In this response to Ambrose, VanTassel-Baska, Coleman, and Cross’s (2010) thought-provoking article on the nature and state of the field of gifted education, the author first discusses the role of disciplinary knowledge in his field. He argues that gifted education, as a normative and practical endeavor (i.e., a profession), is different from academic disciplines in research agendas and that technical rationality is not sufficient for identifying its “best practice.” The author then suggests a “flat” structure to facilitate close collaboration between theorists, researchers, and practitioners in tackling pressing problems and fashioning innovative practices. To facilitate discussion of explorations in our practice, he delineates three basic service models or paradigms in gifted education as follows: the gifted child paradigm, the talent development paradigm, and the differentiation paradigm. He proposes five criteria for assessing their strengths and potential weaknesses. Finally, he suggests that the best way of providing evidence-based best practice is through use-inspired, design studies, which not only address the question of whether a practical model works but also specify goals, assumptions, resources, processes, and constraints involved so that “how it works” is made transparent.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent topic in K-12 education recently. However, pedagogical design has remained a major challenge, especially among young learners. Guided by the Zone of Proximal Development theory and AI education research literature, this design-based study proposes an analogy-based pedagogical approach to support AI teaching and learning in upper primary education. This pedagogical approach is centered on human–AI comparison, where humans are gradually shifted from an analogue to a contrast to make visible the attributes, mechanisms, and processes of AI. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental study with mixed methods was conducted. The quantitative comparison shows that the participants in the experimental group learning with the analogy-based pedagogical approach significantly outperformed their peers with the conventional direct instructional approach in all three dimensions of AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. Qualitative analyses further reveal its pedagogical benefits, including demystifying AI through relatable and engaging learning, supporting student comprehension and skill mastery, and nurturing critical thinking and attitudes. The analogy-based approach contributes to the field of K-12 AI education with an age-appropriate, child-friendly pedagogical approach. Notably, AI education should prioritize teaching for student understanding, and AI should be recognized as an independent subject with interdisciplinary applications.}

abstract = {This article describes a study of educational outcomes for 0- to 8-year-old children with blindness and low vision (BLV) who are learning sonification concepts. Children with BLV experience barriers to accessing education and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), fields which traditionally rely heavily on visual representation of information. There is growing awareness of the potential of sonification, a technology to represent data and information in non-speech audio, to improve education access. While early learning of assistive technology skills is deemed essential for equity of access to education across the curriculum, children are generally not introduced to the concept of sonification at school until at academic level in secondary or tertiary education. Little is known about how young children with BLV engage with this promising technology. First, ‘CosmoBally on Sonoplanet’ is introduced, an accessible, educational game application for iPads and Android tablets. Then findings are shared from an anonymous online survey that collected formal responses from users of this app, using a combination of Likert-type scale and open-ended questions. The majority of the 17 respondents were (specialist) educators, and five of the respondents identified as having BLV. The survey investigated respondents’ perceptions of the capabilities of young children with BLV in using basic sonification in ‘CosmoBally on Sonoplanet’ to identify shapes – including a circle – to orientate in a digital grid and to create drawings on a touch screen. Results suggest that young children with BLV can learn sonification skills and additionally may build relevant non-sonification skills during this learning process. This article aims to provide a first insight into best practice around early learning of sonification as a potential tool for increased access and inclusion of children with BLV to STEM subjects in school.}

To uncover these new skills, we carried out 30 interviews with editorial staff, executives and technologists working at 23 media organisations based in Europe, North America and Australia. We show that these new forms of cultural capital are essentially two-fold: on the one hand, they involve taking a “structured journalism” approach so as to think of what an ideal story may look like, and then by breaking it down into smaller predictable elements that can be reusable across many versions of that same story; on the other hand, they also call for knowing how to embed a media organisation’s standards and practices into code for automated news. Overall this study argues that a new type of cultural capital emerges, as it is associated with the production of automated news. We call it the distinct-abstract capital, whereby journalism is thought of both as a one-off endeavour and as a process that can be deconstructed in an abstract way close to computer programming.}

While declaring this pipeline, the government assumes the needs of the economy and young people’s needs are (or should be) synchronised. We challenge this assumption and the policy it sustains with data from questionnaires, workshops and interviews with 50 young people from communities in South Wales (including a former mining town and a deprived inner city area) about digital technology’s role in their everyday life. We use a new typography to compare the reality of their socially and economically structured lives to the governmental policy discourse that makes them responsible for their country’s future economic success. To explain these young people’s creative and transgressive use of technology, we also make an empirically grounded contribution to the ongoing theoretical debates about structure and agency.}

abstract = {Highlights We live in a technology-driven age, so the education field must rationally consider chatbots powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Faced with increasing application of AI in education, teachers should be reflective educators, and students should be self-educators. AI chatbots will evolve into a new prosthesis before being institutionalized into the fabric of school education. Reflective educators, institutionalized educators, self-educators foreshadow the future rise of hybrid educators.}

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the correlational and causal relationship between middle school students’ entrepreneurial competencies and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) attitudes. A total of 648 middle school students (seventh and eighth grade) participated in this study. STEM attitude scale and two entrepreneurial competency scales that were developed in different studies in the literature were used as data collection tools. In addition, a simple regression, a multiple regression and a stepwise multiple regression analysis were executed to analyse the data. The correlational analysis showed that there was a moderate level, positive correlation between the STEM attitudes of students and their overall entrepreneurial competencies. Also, the multiple regression analysis showed that entrepreneurial competencies consisting of professionalism, risk-taking, creativity and tenacity explained 41% of the change in STEM attitude. The stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that professionalism predicted the most the STEM attitude statistically more.}

As the use of data science continues to expand, it has been accompanied by a rise in interest and commitment to using these tools for social good. This commentary examines overlooked, and under-researched limitations of data science applications in the social sector—the volume, quality, and context of the available data that currently exists in social service systems require unique considerations. We explore how the presence of small data within the social service contexts can result in extrapolation; if not properly considered, data science can negatively impact the organizations data scientists are trying to assist. We conclude by proposing three ways data scientists interested in working within the social services sector can enhance their contributions to the field: refining and leveraging available data, improving collaborations, and respecting data limitations.}

History is one of the subjects that simulations and games are used for promoting active learning and supporting students in comprehending various history-related subjects. Aim. This article reports on a new educational game on Greek mythology, called MYTH TROUBLES, designed and developed from scratch with the aim of supporting primary school students in studying Greek mythology and raising their interest on the subject of history. Method. The article presents the educational rationale and design of MYTH TROUBLES in the context of an educational games design model proposed in the literature. Since the game was implemented with the platform of Scratch and it is available online both for students (or anyone interested in Greek Mythology) and game developers, some information for its implementation is also provided. The results of a pilot evaluation of MYTH TROUBLES with the help of 21 experienced school teachers are presented, along with proposals for improvement and extension of the game. Results. Teachers evaluated positively MYTH TROUBLES in terms of acceptability, usability, utility as an educational tool, as well as its interface and game play and expressed their willingness to use it in the classroom. Conclusions. MYTH TROUBLES is considered appropriate by teachers for supporting the teaching and learning of Greek mythology and assessing its educational value in class is the next step. Scratch is appropriate for implementing such educational games and sharing them with interested players and game developers.}

The analysis of scientific literature indexed by Web of Science from 1980 to 2023 (n = 1704 items) combined co-occurrence (using VOSviewer) and co-citation (using CiteSpace) techniques based on the words in the title and abstract, as well as the keywords, authors and journals. There is evidence of four main trend topics (Data Literacy, Statistical Literacy, Data-based assessment and e-society) and six thematic clusters (Data Literacy, Statistical Literacy, Quantitative Literacy, Big Data, Data Science and Quantitative Skills). With DL emerging in 2011, the research initially focused on both quantitative and statistical literacy, and later (2012–2016) shifted toward applying statistical literacy to various disciplines. Since 2018, the use of data has led to the emergence of fields like big data and data science, resulting in progress being made in data literacy. The combination of the two analysis techniques offers complementary perspectives: co-word analysis reveals fields of application, and co-citation analysis shows the internal evolution of the discipline. This study evidences a significant increase in publications on DL, indicating its expansion to several disciplines and a promising, yet uncertain, future.}

abstract = {The Computer Science (CS) for All national movement is increasingly relying on state-level change to broaden participation in computing. To foster an environment in which all students have opportunities to thrive in CS education, policy action is necessary to help create the learning conditions for success. CS education in California has grown substantially in the last decade, yet opportunity gaps remain for young women and Black, Latinx, and Native American students. Early grassroots efforts to advance equity in computing evolved into the Computer Science for California coalition of K–16 educators, industry leaders, and other equity advocates to promote the growth of equity-minded teaching and learning opportunities in K–12 CS education. New policies at the state level reflect an increasing commitment among Sacramento policymakers to expand CS education. Yet troubling disparities in CS access and success continue to exist between traditionally advantaged students and their historically underserved peers. By drawing on interviews with 20 individuals involved in CS education policy, this study illuminates the contributing factors to recent policy successes and considerations for achieving further progress. Interviewees described the importance of tapping into the values of influential decision makers, educating policymakers about the benefits of CS education, and identifying the problems and solutions that require policy attention. To build the capacity of key policy actors in making informed decisions, this research demonstrates the continued value of providing useful information, developing relationships with policymakers, and creating resources that are easy to consume and understand. The interviews also suggest that attention to funding, disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, equity, and ongoing stakeholder support will shape prospects for CS education policy success moving forward.}

Following other disciplines that have developed in symbiotic relationships to one another, DCS puts computation in conversation with fields from across the arts, humanities, physical, and social sciences. Our foundational premise is the bidirectional influence between these disciplines and digital artifacts and computation. The 4As (artifact, architecture, abstraction, and agency) benefit from both the scepticism of the liberal arts in the face of ubiquitous digital processes and the analytical opening for examining questions pertaining to creative and imaginative alternatives to the digital and computational status quo. We provide an ultra-contemporary case study to demonstrate the framework in use.}

However, very little attention has been paid to investigating these tools’ overall effects on students’ academic achievement and the study features that may moderate the effects of block-based visual programming from a comprehensive perspective. Thus, the present study carried out a meta-analysis to systemically examine 29 empirical studies (extracting 34 effect sizes) using experimental or quasi-experiments involving the programming learning effects of employing block-based visual programming tools to date (until the end of 2019). The results showed a small to medium significant positive overall mean effect size (fixed-effect model g = 0.37; random-effects model g = 0.47) of the use of these block-based visual programming tools with respect to students’ academic achievement. Furthermore, the overall mean effect size was significantly affected by the educational stage, programming tool used, experimental treatment, and school location. Discussions and implications based on the findings are provided.}

abstract = {Fostering students’ computer programming skills has become an important educational issue in the globe. However, it remains a challenge for students to understand those abstract concepts when learning computer programming, implying the need to provide instant learning diagnosis and feedback in computer programming activities. In this study, a Two-Tier Test-Based Programming Training (T3PT) approach was proposed. Accordingly, an online learning system was developed to provide students with precision feedback for guiding them to identify misconceptions of computer programming to improve their computer programming learning achievement. In order to examine the effects of the proposed approach, a learning system was developed and a quasi-experiment was conducted. Two classes of 99 eighth-grade students from Taiwan were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students in the experimental group used the learning system based on the T3PT approach, while the control group used the conventional learning system. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was significantly superior to the conventional programming learning approach in terms of students’ programming logic concepts, problem-solving awareness, technology acceptance, and satisfaction with the learning approach. Accordingly, discussion and suggestions are provided for future research.}

abstract = {We propose a minimum learning judgment system that is appropriate for online learning environments, and we verify this minimum learning judgment system through various experiments. By focusing on the learning effort, this system can easily and quickly determine whether learners have exerted the minimum effort required for learning. To do this, the system automatically generates a word game and determines whether minimum learning has taken place through the results of the word game. To verify the minimum learning judgment system, we conducted a comparative experiment on the importance of high-frequency words, a word count verification test for word games, and a judgment criteria verification test based on the length of a video lecture. Results of the experiments show that high-frequency words can be used as a feature to determine minimum learning. The appropriate number of words in the word game for the minimum learning judgment was found to be seven, and the results showed that the video length did not affect the minimum learning criteria. In addition, the minimum learning judgment accuracy result was 82%. This is not considered very high judgment accuracy, but the accuracy of the judgment is positive considering the aim of this study.}

abstract = {The increasing availability of remote education opportunities enables students to access different types of study programs limited by the dimensions of a classroom. Remote learning has been accredited as an effective technique for delivering education to students and teachers globally. However, some academic disciplines such as Computer Science are abounding with many challenges in practicing programming tasks in remote settings. This research aims to understand the students’ existing setup for practicing JAVA programming in remote settings and proposes an intervention to help students get appropriate hints to fix compiler errors. The proposed solution has implications for both students and teachers, as it is under the teacher’s direct observation. The teacher can monitor the content according to students’ needs, which may potentially save them from teaching challenges. To formulate our study, we first surveyed to understand the challenges that students face in JAVA programming when trying to fix errors in a remote setting. Then, based on the results of the first survey and prior experience of conducting programming course practicals along with the existing literature, the proposed web portal was created and presented to the students to fix errors. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the proposed setup followed by a student attitude survey. The results show the portal’s leverage in reducing the time required to fix errors and the number of compilation attempts. The survey indicates a positive response.}

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the leisure behaviors of adolescent defectors from North to South Korea and the mental health benefits they derive from leisure participation, a topic not previously addressed in the literature. Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 17 participants. Qualitative analysis based on acculturation theory revealed three salient themes of leisure benefits: (a) creating a sense of belonging, (b) increasing psychological well-being, and (c) facilitating acculturation. The results indicate that participants gained social and psychological benefits through leisure activities. They also suggest that the provision of recreation programs that encourage inter/intragroup participation can be an important component of these young refugees’ cultural and social adjustment.}

abstract = {To aid in the development of a globally competitive workforce, federal policymakers have expressed the priority of preparing students and adults with disabilities to succeed in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Yet, no research has examined the extent to which information-processing, literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills in technologically rich environments may associate with having a STEM degree for various disability populations. This study analyzed the United States nationally representative data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) to examine associations between adult skills and having a STEM degree for people with and without disabilities. No direct associations were found between adult skills and having a STEM degree for people with learning disabilities or for people without disabilities. These groups’ information processing, literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills were not determining factors in STEM degree attainment. However, findings suggest a significant association between problem-solving skills and having a STEM degree for people with visual and/or hearing impairments. Policy implications are discussed.}

The purpose here is to elevate these constructs and perspectives for discussion among the broader education research community. First, we provide an overview of the unique contributions of the report to move the ELs and STEM fields forward. Second, we describe ELs in terms of their heterogeneity and the inconsistency of educational policies that affect their learning opportunities in STEM subjects. Third, we describe contemporary views on STEM subjects and language with ELs that indicate that instructional shifts across STEM subjects and language are mutually supportive. Fourth, we describe promising instructional strategies to promote STEM learning and language development with ELs. Lastly, we close the article by reimagining STEM education with ELs and offer potential next steps. These foundational constructs and perspectives on STEM subjects and language with ELs are critical because they provide the conceptual grounding for the design of the education system for ELs. The report could contribute to building a knowledge base for ELs in STEM subjects and language as education research, policy, and practice converge to reimagine what is possible to both support and challenge ELs to learn academically rigorous content standards that are expected of all students.}

A sample of Chinese high school students (N = 560) completed questionnaires assessing academic self-efficacy, academic buoyancy, peer support, and test anxiety. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed an indirect effect of academic self-efficacy on test anxiety through academic buoyancy. Moreover, the results of the conditional process analysis demonstrated that this indirect effect was moderated by peer support. The findings suggested that both personal positive psychological characteristics (e.g., academic buoyancy) and school environmental factors (e.g., peer support) are protective factors for test anxiety in high school students. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.}

The development of urban primary school students’ ST is the result of multiple factors at the level of individual drive, family environment, school teaching, and social resources. The result of data analysis showed that the influence path of ST development of urban primary school students driven by multiple factors includes three paths: parent participation leading, scientific practice leading, and home-school-community integration. We have interpreted the influence mechanism of each path in detail and put forward the enlightenment for science education policy and practice.}

abstract = {Pair Programming is considered an effective approach to programming education, but the synchronous collaboration of two programmers involves complex coordination, making this method difficult to be widely adopted in educational settings. Artificial Intelligence (AI) code-generation tools have outstanding capabilities in program generation and natural language understanding, creating conducive conditions for pairing with humans in programming. Now some more mature tools are gradually being implemented. This review summarizes the current status of educational applications and research on AI-assisted programming technology. Through thematic coding of literature, existing research focuses on five aspects: underlying technology and tool introduction, performance evaluation, the potential impacts and coping strategies, exploration of behavioral patterns in technological application, and ethical and safety issues. A systematic analysis of current literature provides the following insights for future academic research related to the practice of “human-machine pairing” in programming: (1) Affirming the value of AI code-generation tools while also clearly defining their technical limitations and ethical risks; (2) Developing adaptive teaching ecosystems and educational models, conducting comprehensive empirical research to explore the efficiency mechanisms of AI-human paired programming; (3) Further enriching the application of research methods by integrating speculative research with empirical research, combining traditional methods with emerging technologies.}

The study aims to analyze the development and implementation of a hybrid AR and VR educational system designed to enhance training and learning outcomes across various educational settings. A total of 238 students from universities participated in the study. The participant is randomly assigned into two groups: the experimental group, which interacts with the AR and VR hybrid earning systems, and the control group, which engages in traditional classroom-based learning. Survey data were gathered on student satisfaction, perceived learning effectiveness, and overall experience using the hybrid AR and VR system. Through empirical assessments, this study assesses the hybrid approach’s efficacy in a range of educational situations by gauging how it affects student engagement, retention of information, and skill development. The data analyze the statistical methods, including t-tests, regression analyses, descriptive statistics, and ANOVA, to determine significant differences between the groups. The data is analyzed by the SPSS software. The results reveal that the integration of AR and VR significantly not only enhances the educational experience but also supports diverse learning styles and improves overall learning outcomes. This study contributes to the expanding literature of study on educational technology by shedding light on the training and instructional applications of AR and VR that are performing well and by promoting their greater integration into the academic curriculum.}

abstract = {This article explores the use of modding as a formal tool for learning history. The article examines data from a formal analysis of Europa Universalis IV (EUIV), a survey of 331 EUIV forum participants and a case study of 18 university participants. Significant quantitative survey data indicated that 45% (149/331) of participants had modified EUIV, and of the 125 participants who responded with comments about modding, a significant number (86/125 responses or 68.8%) explained how they had learnt about history, geography or other subjects through the modding process. Closer analysis of survey and case study responses and mods reveals the variety of ways participants learnt and critiqued history through the modding process. The article discusses the data and the pedagogical affordance of modding in a few steps. First, the article briefly explores the evidence that indicates modding is popular within the EUIV gaming community. In this instance, it examines whether given the popularity of gaming practice, modding might also be seen as a new casual form of engagement with games. Second, the article reviews the modding process in EUIV and examines how both playing and creating mods may be beneficial for learning history. Modding is examined in terms of its pedagogical importance and the unique educational opportunities it may offer that are not otherwise accessible through other forms of game-based learning. Finally, the article explores how and what the case study participants learnt when they were tasked with creating and implementing playable mods to demonstrate their understanding of history. Overall, the article considers the growing importance of mods, how learners can create and represent history using mods and how mods can provide a platform for learners to develop their own critique and analysis of official history.}

Two hundred and thirteen students filled in a questionnaire, merging answers with performance parameters from the university’s database. Multivariate regression analyses with performance as outcome and satisfaction measures as predictors were conducted on the levels: (1) unfiltered dataset, (2) one enrollment, and (3) 2 + enrollments. Performance satisfaction explained variance of grade point average and the number of failed exams on levels 1 and 2. Course satisfaction and the wish to continue studying were strongly associated with grade point average in nonprioritized programs of students with more than one enrollment. University systems worldwide could benefit from parallel programs, possibly preventing immediate dropout of unsatisfied students.}

Ideally, classroom pedagogies would reflect the scientific practices modeled in the IVE to the best extent possible. In this case study, we explore how one teacher enacted authentic scientific practices after 3 years of IVE implementations plus participation in the corresponding professional development (PD) experience. Although the teacher believed that the inquiry practices modeled in the IVE and the PD were an important part of his teaching, these beliefs were not transferred into practice. Our findings suggest that PD should include opportunities for teachers to reflect on their own practice integrating technology and consider external factors contributing to pedagogical change beyond PD.}

Nevertheless, there is a lack of research addressing the impact of this transfer on programming misconceptions during the transition. The way programming concepts are taught to K-12 learners can later result in misconceptions for adult learners. The main objective was to examine the impact of mediated transfer using the bridging method pedagogical approach on the prevalence of programming misconceptions. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in school settings during informatics (computer science) classes among 163 sixth-grade students. The control group received traditional programming lectures using the text-based programming language, Python. Conversely, the experimental group utilized a mediated transfer pedagogical approach by starting with the block-based programming language MakeCode for micro:bit before transitioning to the text-based Python. Our findings indicate that the experimental group significantly reduced programming misconceptions in fundamental programming concepts: variables, sequencing, selection, and loops - compared to the control group. This suggests that the use of block-based programming language as an initial step in programming education, followed by a structured transition to text-based programming language, can effectively mitigate common misconceptions among K-12 learners.}

This paper explores the question: if those studies were based on participants born several technology-generations earlier, does this research need an update? Children now have greater access to smartphones and STEM outreach opportunities than before, which may have shifted girls’ technology learning preferences. This research found that most studies about gender and tinkering were conducted before 2006, revealing a research gap about younger generations. Future work could explore whether preferences to learn by process or by tinkering are still disproportionately represented in different genders. This work has implications for how human factors professionals design gender-inclusive products and training.}

The importance of social elements is also clear in the articles. The articles also point out that the teacher’s role in digital pedagogy primarily involves facilitating and coaching. AI in learning has a high potential, but it also has many limitations. Many worries are linked with ethical issues, such as biases in algorithms, privacy, transparency, and data ownership.

abstract = {Algorithmic media have adopted and adapted divinatory practices and vernaculars of prediction, prophecy, probability, fortune-telling and forecasting – suggesting a possible link between artificial intelligence and pre-scientific modes of speculation. Statistical thinking and magical thinking, too, can be recognised as closely correlated epistemological systems for governing societies and ways of life. In fact, primitive astrological practices of looking up at the stars may represent one of the earliest statistical projects involving sophisticated calculations and data sets. Such pattern-making techniques could even be considered precursory to machine learning. As a point of departure for exploring these eclectic relationships between stars and data, magic and machines, I use a media archaeological methodology to question the historical roles of both astrological and computational divination in mediating methods of control, surveillance and knowledge production across transforming societal contexts. This methodology is especially relevant for examining historical narratives in the field of cultural studies as it makes apparent the hyper-connectedness between objects, cultural representation and sites of hegemonic contention. My findings reveal relationships between celestial pattern recognition and efforts to exert control over and manipulate the natural environment and its populations, the historical impact of meteorological and climatological practices for predicting and influencing future events with artificial intelligence, and links between statistics and algorithmic data biases. This article suggests a speculative genealogy of astrology and artificial intelligence, as well as a genealogy of the theological, scientific and machinic unconscious.}

abstract = {Technology is an increasingly omnipresent and rapidly changing component of today’s world. As a result, there is an urgency to develop talent in the field of computer science (CS). The purpose of this article is to examine ways that educational systems can develop students’ talents to fill the need for skilled CS professionals. We provide an overview of the talent development megamodel as an exemplar of talent development frameworks and discuss ways to tailor it to fit CS talent trajectories. We describe three key components in a CS talent trajectory: early access to materials and programs; support from mentors; and the development of psychosocial skills. We introduce a proposed model, the computer science talent development model (CSTDM), for finding and developing talents in computer science in K–12 settings. CSTDM includes advanced STEM learning opportunities beginning in middle school, a focus on the development of psychosocial skills, and guidance for students regarding STEM career development.}

abstract = {A quality computer science (CS) teacher needs to understand students’ common misconceptions in learning CS. This study explored one aspect of CS teachers’ understanding of student misconceptions: their perceptions of student misconceptions related to introductory programming. Perceptions in this study included three parts: teachers’ perceived frequency of a student misconception, teachers’ perceived importance of a misconception in learning, and teachers’ confidence in addressing a misconception. Teachers in our study taught a Python-based CS course for high schools students. A survey was designed and administered to assess teachers’ perceptions of students’ misconceptions. Our results indicated that teachers’ confidence of addressing misconceptions and the teaching context may affect their perceptions of student misconceptions. We also found that some latent misconceptions are likely to lead to a perception of low frequency as they can be more difficult to detect. Moreover, our study found that teachers’ degrees and additional computing training showed positive relationships with their confidence of addressing student misconceptions and that additional computing training also showed a positive relationship with teachers’ perceived importance of student misconceptions. Implications of the findings for future research and practice of CS education are discussed.}

abstract = {This study implemented a data-driven approach to identify Chinese high school students’ common errors in a Java-based introductory programming course using the data in an automated assessment tool called the Mulberry. Students’ error-related behaviors were also analyzed, and their relationships to success in introductory programming were investigated. This study identified 15 common compilation errors and 6 common test errors. The results showed that these common errors accounted for a large proportion of all errors, so identifying the common errors is important to help students succeed in introductory programming courses. Based on these common errors, five underlying student difficulties were identified and are discussed. In addition, after analyzing existing measures of students’ error-related behaviors, we developed a measure called improvement rate to quantify students’ success in fixing errors. The results of our study suggest that students’ competence of improving code is important to their success in introductory programming. We recommend researchers design and develop automated assessment tools that provide feedback messages for common student errors and instructors who explicitly teach knowledge and skills of improving code in class.}

abstract = {Background/Context: Bi/multilingual students’ STEM learning is better supported when educators leverage their language and cultural practices as resources, but STEM subject divisions have been historically constructed based on oppressive, dominant values and exclude the ways of knowing of nondominant groups. Truly promoting equity requires expanding and transforming STEM disciplines. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article contributes to efforts to illuminate emergent bi/multilingual students’ ways of knowing, languaging, and doing in STEM. We follow the development of syncretic literacies in relation to translanguaging practices, asking, How do knowledges and practices from different communities get combined and reorganized by students and teachers in service of new modeling practices? Setting and Participants: We focus on a seventh-grade science classroom, deliberately designed to support syncretic literacies and translanguaging practices, where computer science concepts were infused into the curriculum through modeling activities. The majority of the students in the bilingual program had arrived in the United States at most three years before enrolling, from the Caribbean and Central and South America. Research Design: We analyze one lesson that was part of a larger research–practice partnership focused on teaching computer science through leveraging translanguaging practices and syncretic literacies. The lesson was a modeling and computing activity codesigned by the teacher and two researchers about post–Hurricane María outmigration from Puerto Rico. Analysis used microethnographic methods to trace how students assembled translanguaging, social, and schooled practices to make sense of and construct models. Findings/Results: Findings show how students assembled representational forms from a variety of practices as part of accomplishing and negotiating both designed and emergent goals. These included sensemaking, constructing, explaining, justifying, and interpreting both the physical and computational models of migration. Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications support the development of theory and pedagogy that intentionally make space for students to engage in meaning-making through translanguaging and syncretic practices in order to provide new possibilities for lifting up STEM learning that may include, but is not constrained by, disciplinary learning. Additional implications for teacher education and student assessment practices call for reconceptualizing schooling beyond day-to-day curriculum as part of making an ontological shift away from prioritizing math, science, and CS disciplinary and language objectives as defined by and for schooling, and toward celebrating, supporting, and centering students’ diverse, syncretic knowledges and knowledge use.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Today’s uncertain economic and social dynamics are leading companies to seek the sort of human talent that will help them to survive and thrive. Training demands are thus arising for specific skills and competencies that would make current students and employment seekers more employable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the twenty-first century’s major employability skills and competencies as well as the main demand trends for skills and competencies. METHODS: An international panel of experts (from Spain, Thailand and Poland), from both, academic and professional business backgrounds, were asked to quantitatively project the importance of different generic and specific skills and competencies over the next five years. They were asked to do so twice, once before and once after a four-year interval (in 2016 and in 2019). Each time, they were interviewed to discuss the results. RESULTS: The most valued employability skills were of a generic nature, in all three countries. Regarding specific skills, those of a social and managerial nature were the most highly valued. Work experience and formal education became less relevant for employability. CONCLUSIONS: The study’s results can lead to recommendations on how to design a more employability-oriented curriculum in educational institutions.}

abstract = {This study focused on the digital design practices of Raul, a 15-year-old participant at a summer video game design camp for adolescents. As Raul developed his original game, You Will Perish, I wondered what his design process might reveal about (a) the practice of affectively and procedurally literate video game design and (b) the literacy pedagogies that can support such design. Guided by the concept of serendipity, I describe Raul’s design practice as an open process characterized by bouts of failure, chance, and discovery, and I examine how such forces shaped the emergence of his game. Using transversal analysis, I trace Raul’s design through an account of frustration and failure, perseverance and pride, showing how the challenges of the game’s creator become those of the game’s players. The study highlights the generative potential of serendipitous literacies wherever and whenever literacy happens.}

abstract = {The comprehensiveness of teacher professional identity (TPI) studies conducted by African and Asian researchers highlights the importance of valid TPI indicators across Africa and Asia. Questionnaire TPI indicators are important to obtain valid direct comparisons between teachers in Africa and Asia. The process of developing a questionnaire served as an avenue for researchers from Asian and African regions to learn about TPI pointers from each other. This study used the Delphi technique to achieve consensus on valid TPI indicators across African and Asian regions. Fourteen researchers from the Asia-Africa University Dialogue Network for Educational Development (AAD) were selected using purposive sampling. TPI in this study is defined as a multifaceted concept comprising contextual and personal factors that differ across national borders. The indicators in the questionnaire represented personal, social and institutional factors perceived by teachers and outlined in the literature. In the Delphi study process, the researchers used three rounds to validate the initial 40-item TPI questionnaire. Subsequent analysis of the results indicated high importance and consensus among experts. Owing to its standardized procedure, the TPI questionnaire makes it possible to collect and compare the TPI dimensions from the different socio-economic contexts in which teachers work in Africa and Asia. The findings of this study guide African and Asian researchers on the common understanding of TPI characteristics prevalent across African and Asian regions. Research protocols for fostering quality research toward addressing challenges faced by the teacher education sector in African and Asian countries is also implied.}

The study’s purpose was to understand the pedagogical, technological, and organizational challenges and benefits of computing-enhanced digital learning environments, and to explore teachers’ pedagogical strategies. This study employed a qualitative research paradigm using nation-wide, online samples, which included 133 elementary and secondary school teachers from Hebrew-speaking and Arabic-speaking schools in Israel. Participants were asked to share their perspectives and experiences of ERT through open-ended questions in an online questionnaire. The bottom-up analysis of the data, based on the Grounded Theory approach, yielded 1,822 statements reflecting teachers’ perceptions of pedagogical, technological, and organizational challenges (N = 580) and benefits of ERT (N = 827). The analysis also revealed a variety of pedagogical distance learning strategies used by teachers (N = 415). The study raises the need to turn a curse into a blessing by incorporating the experience of remote technology-enhanced learning and online activities into the school agenda on a regular basis. Thus, teachers and students would develop important digital competencies and be prepared for the next emergency event. The implications of our findings for educational theory and practice of educational computing are discussed.}

Sixty-seven undergraduate students in a computer programing fundamentals course were randomly assigned into one of two groups: (1) experimental group (N = 34; received self-regulated learning support) and (2) control group (N = 33). Participants in both groups were asked to solve programing problems using Python over 3 weeks, and their cognitive load levels were measured after each week. The results showed that novice learners’ self-regulated learning skills can be influenced by learning support, which contributes to solving complex problems. The results also suggest that, given the sequence of tasks (i.e., basic and advanced well-structured and ill-structured problems), self-regulated learning support may require time to be effective. The germane load of the experimental group was higher for well-structured problems than that of the control group. Using logistic regression, the two groups were differentiated through different variables measured in this study, which showed a high predictive explanatory power. The results provide implications for designing self-regulated learning support for programing courses, using problem-based learning in association with problem-solving skills, self-regulated learning skills, and cognitive load management.}

abstract = {Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.}

abstract = {Information and communications technology (ICT) is crucial in any contemporary society, especially if its online presence is to be widely significant, but, in a national context, it is important to investigate whether there is a compelling ICT ‘politic’ in the education sector in Turkey. This study specifically focuses on the ICT for Educational Development (ICT4ED) (Fatih) project, valued at US$8 billion, which is an embodiment of future educational reform in centralist Turkey. The study investigates the level of policy-making capacity within the scope of the Fatih project, which promises to fully integrate ICT into education in order to solve many educational issues, such as establishing entrepreneurialism in education, improving ICT sectors, exporting educational services to other nations for profit, and, ultimately, meeting the overarching purpose of Turkey becoming a competitive nation. The discourse of the government is to explore technological opportunities within education in order to create new ‘profitable’ avenues that conceive education as a ‘commodity’ and a ‘private good’, which is another feature of fragmented centralisation through public-private partnership(s) for both covert and overt privatisations. While the Fatih project defines the future as having new, ‘fully integrated ICT in education’, this study presents three main normative arguments — with regard to the project’s political execution, technical development and philosophical conception — to refute its objectives and highlight that it is destined to fail, and to suggest what urgent matters the ICT4ED politic should highlight in future education.}

We provide a comprehensive overview of the identification of learning strategies in the existing literature, the design and development of preliminary questionnaire items, the refinement of item wording, and the examination of the internal structure and reliability of the final instrument. The construction of the items was based on the educational theory of Self-Regulated Learning. The final version of the questionnaire, called the Computer Programming Learning Strategies Questionnaire (CEAPC), was administered to 647 students enrolled in computer programming courses. The data collected from the participants were used to examine the construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The CEAPC consists of 13 subscales, each corresponding to a different type of learning strategy, and a total of 89 items. Statistical analyses of the data indicate that the CEAPC has adequate construct validity. In addition, the results of the internal consistency analysis indicate satisfactory reliability across the different subscales of the instrument. This study contributes to the field of educational research, particularly in the area of self-regulated learning in computer programming.}

abstract = {This study examines the effectiveness of a collaborative support method in enhancing programming learning outcomes in a serious game. The game Code Hasp was developed to facilitate the comparison between two support methods, worked examples and a collaborative peer support approach. A total of 111 elementary school students participated, divided into two groups. The experimental group received collaborative support from teammates alongside worked examples, while the control group relied solely on worked examples. Pre- and post-test results and in-game data revealed that the collaborative support method improved learning efficiency and problem-solving skills. A notable effect of the process was the emergence of a leadership role in most collaborative groups. The game’s support design and shared goal structure mitigate potential problems associated with unbalanced participation. These findings suggest that collaborative support systems in serious games are a promising strategy for promoting engagement and improving learning outcomes in programming education.}

abstract = {In higher education, it is challenging to cultivate non-computer science majors’ programming concepts. This study used the GAME model (gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry) in a programming education course to enhance undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. There were 83 undergraduates taking part in this study, which adopted a quasi-experimental research design. Students in the experimental group (n = 43) experienced a course in which the GAME model was used to design the block-based programming course. The control group (n = 40) was given a general information education course covering similar learning concepts without the game-based learning strategy. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to investigate the effect of the GAME model on students’ learning outcomes for the quantitative data. In the qualitative analysis, students’ responses to the course perception questionnaire were coded and analyzed. The results showed that students in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts regarding self-efficacy and basic programming concepts. The experimental treatment resulted in a small to medium effect size difference between the two groups. The results showed that incorporating the GAME model into block-based programming teaching helped improve undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. In addition, these experimental group undergraduates also perceived the pedagogic GAME model positively. Several research suggestions are proposed based on the findings of the present study.}

The participants were 87 college students studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL) at an English medium university in Turkey. At pretest, the control group had scored significantly higher in reading comprehension based on a standardized measure. Both of the experimental groups significantly improved their reading comprehension and metacognitive strategy awareness, while the control group’s reading and engagement scores decreased. The in-class experimental group also improved on the engagement scale. No significant difference was found between the experimental groups or compared to the control group in reading comprehension.

Utilizing a quasi-experimental research design, this study compared students’ programming learning achievements (PLA), self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, learning beliefs, and learning motivation in MetaClassroom with those in traditional classroom settings. The findings revealed that MetaClassroom significantly enhanced students’ PLA and SRL skills, particularly in subdimensions including Metacognitive Skills, Persistence, and Seeking Help. Additionally, MetaClassroom positively impacted students’ learning beliefs and learning motivation, demonstrating its potential in optimizing knowledge acquisition, application processes, and fostering students’ higher-order thinking skills. By integrating the 3DLP concept into targeted programming learning environments, MetaClassroom created an innovative immersive learning ecosystem, that bridged theory and practice, offering students a comprehensive and engaging platform to develop both foundational knowledge and practical skills. This study not only validated the effectiveness of MetaClassroom in improving students’ programming learning performance and learning experience, but also introduced a new paradigm that integrated teaching, learning, and assessment. The paradigm offers new insights and directions for both programming education and broader educational practices, paving the way for future developments in educational technology.}

Specifically, this study aimed to examine what and how achievement emotions were aroused to impact learners’ academic success during Scratch implementation processes by employing regression analyses. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduates (Mage = 20.44, SDage = 1.09, 55.8% female) were voluntarily recruited to participate in a Scratch-based instruction workshop during a 6-week period. The workshop was structured with regard to preparation, Scratch-based programming learning and projects, and assessment activities and questionnaire implemented both before the instructional period and after the workshop. The results suggested that the Scratch-based intervention significantly increased students’ overall motivation and examination performance. Concerning achievement emotions, the outcome emotion of hopelessness first negatively predicted students’ motivation and performance. Anxiety then replaced hopelessness as a negative predictor, while enjoyment was the strongest predictor of motives and performance. Taking eight emotions together, the arousal of activity and outcome emotions within visual programming environments facilitated students’ emotion dynamics that impacted motivation and performance. The discussion and contributions concerning the mechanism behind the effectiveness of visualization and the emotion-performance relationship are presented herein.}

Meanwhile, problem-based digital making (DM), which combines the child-friendly programming activities of DM with problem-solving elements, is an emerging instructional design to facilitate STEAM learning. This qualitative case study examines the implementation of a problem-based DM instructional program that used the block-based programming tool Scratch to cultivate the participants’ creativity. Fifty-four middle school students (aged 10–14 years) in Hong Kong participated in the program, which totaled 10 contact hours over five consecutive weeks. Through triangulating students’ DM artifacts, video recordings, field notes, and interviews, the researchers characterized the students’ creative expression, examined the role of problem-based DM in encouraging creative work, and investigated the use of Scratch for mediating student creativity. The results showed that problem-based DM activities fostered students’ creative expressions in the dimensions of novelty, utility, aesthetics, and authenticity. While Scratch mediated the way the students presented their solutions, it had limitations that hindered the students’ digital artifact construction. The findings provide theoretical insights for framing creativity and offer practical implications for the implementation of problem-based DM in K–12 contexts.}

Various commercial, governmental and civil society organizations now envisage education as a highly coded, software-mediated and data-driven social institution. Such spaces are to be governed through computational processes written in computer code and tracked through big data. In an original analysis of developments from commercial, governmental and civil society sectors, the article examines two interrelated dimensions of an emerging smart schools imaginary: (1) the constant flows of digital data that smart schools depend on and the mobilization of analytics that enable student data to be used to anticipate and shape their behaviours; and (2) the ways that young people are educated to become ‘computational operatives’ who must ‘learn to code’ in order to become ‘smart citizens’ in the governance of the smart city. These developments constitute an emerging educational space fabricated from intersecting standards, technologies, discourses and social actors, all infused with the aspirations of technical experts to govern the city at a distance through both monitoring young people as ‘data objects’ and schooling them as active ‘computational citizens’ with the responsibility to compute the future of the city.}

abstract = {This commentary lays out a framework for building on early critical cartographic and critical geographic information system work to develop a critical approach for the computational future of geographical thought and praxis. Computation – as a highly representational and structural form which combines speech and action – is a very particular way of building worlds. As computation becomes more prevalent in critiques of deep fakes, GeoAI, and platform geographies, geographers have also developed the foundations for a critical computational approach with an explicitly spatial or geographical focus that combines both theory and practice. Yet, while many of the technological affordances of spatial computation are relatively novel, the critiques raised by social, political, economic, and cultural geographers shadow debates that emerged two decades ago between cartographers and geospatial scientists about the power and praxis of mapping as it becomes translated into a digital era. This commentary argues that by returning to these debates, as well as critique by Black, queer, and Indigenous computing seen in other disciplines, geographers find themselves in a moment of opportunity to deeply influence the future of computation via a situated, critical geographical thought and praxis.}

abstract = {Integrating engineering design into K-12 curricula is increasingly important as engineering has been incorporated into many STEM education standards. However, the ill-structured and open-ended nature of engineering design makes it difficult for an instructor to keep track of the design processes of all students simultaneously and provide personalized feedback on a timely basis. This study proposes a Bayesian network model to dynamically and automatically assess students’ engagement with engineering design tasks and to support formative feedback. Specifically, we applied a Bayesian network to 111 ninth-grade students’ process data logged by a computer-aided design software program that students used to solve an engineering design challenge. Evidence was extracted from the log files and fed into the Bayesian network to perform inferential reasoning and provide a barometer of their performance in the form of posterior probabilities. Results showed that the Bayesian network model was competent at predicting a student’s task performance. It performed well in both identifying students of a particular group (recall) and ensuring identified students were correctly labeled (precision). This study also suggests that Bayesian networks can be used to pinpoint a student’s strengths and weaknesses for applying relevant science knowledge to engineering design tasks. Future work of implementing this tool within the computer-aided design software will provide instructors a powerful tool to facilitate engineering design through automatically generating personalized feedback to students in real time.}

Design/Approach/Methods: The study is an analytical policy review based on the policy documents, theoretical discussion, and development of practice. Findings: This new Chinese education informatization policy was driven by three factors: the promotion of education informatization 1.0 in China, the requirement of education modernization toward 2035, and the response to “Wisdom Education.” The framework for action can be summarized as “One Goal, Three Tasks, and Eight Actions.” The main features involve innovation-driven development rather than technology-driven development, committing to the expansion of digital educational resources rather than the digital presentation of textbooks, and aiming at improving teachers and students’ information literacy rather than the applied skills of information technology. The future vision of the plan involves building new models on talent cultivation, education service, and education governance. The new models on talent cultivation involve establishing “Wisdom Teaching” mode, learning mode, and intelligent learning environment supported by artificial intelligence technology. The new education service models entail building the admission and sharing mechanism of quality educational resources based on National Network for Education and the public service platform and system for educational resources by means of the cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The new education governance models involve achieving precise, flat, and humanized education governance. Originality/Value: This article entails expounding the motivation, framework for action, main features, and vision of the education informatization 2.0 in China, which will be helpful for learning and understanding the current background, stage, and future path of China’s education informatization.}

This study explores connections between an individual’s creative behavior and his or her creative brain by asking each participant to design an open-ended virtual product in an integrated system consisting of virtual reality and brainwaves. The results show a significant correlation between the individual creativity level and the state of flow. There is a significant correlation between the state of flow and the quality of the creative product. The attention value is correlated significantly with the quality of product. The participants’ four different behaviors significantly demonstrated different attention and meditation levels. The sequential analysis shows that people with high product creativity have a higher attention value while maintaining a state of relaxation, demonstrated during the behavior of painting in the virtual reality environment. Given a limited period of time, a higher level of product creativity can be achieved through persistent implementation, concentration, and by being relaxed both physically and mentally.

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses have become a frequent platform for learners to acquire knowledge. This study aims to explore multiple factors influencing learner retention in MOOCs during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this, we collected quantitative and qualitative data from questionnaires and qualitative data from interviews and then analyzed them through the Partial Least Square–Structural Equation Modeling to test 14 research hypotheses. The proposed research model and research hypotheses are empirically tested with 243 participants across the world. According to the results, support is found for all of the 14 research hypotheses. We confirmed 14 factors influencing learner retention in MOOCs. The result is beneficial for designers and manufacturers of MOOCs to improve the quality of the products and facilitate online or blended learning during this special time. It could also help students improve their learning experiences. Future research could examine influencing factors of learner retention in MOOCs with interdisciplinary cooperation.}

abstract = {Uzbekistan has not adopted robotics education as the school curriculum yet. However, several robotics learning centers have introduced robotics education in an informal setting. This research paper aims to highlight the essence of robotics education in Uzbekistan investigating the perception of parents and children to their full potential and identifying impediments to the process of implementing robotics in Uzbekistan. This research study involves primary and secondary research methods. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the reflection of robotics education among primary and secondary school children. Official statistical data was gathered to prove the scope of demographics. Primary data was collected through the survey among parents whose children attended robotics classes. Ultimately, the authors have used empirical evidence to provide recommendations and solutions on how to implement robotics education effectively in Uzbekistan. Much emphasis has not been put on robotics education in Uzbekistan, despite reforms in the field of STEM education. Moreover, the condition (including teachers, lesson materials, classrooms, computers, and robotics kits) to implement robotics classes as more developed countries are doing has not been created properly, which hampers the introduction of robotics at schools. In addition, the majority of parents are not fully aware of the authentic value of robotics education in children’s lives. Hence, Uzbek schools are lagging in the field of robotics.}

abstract = {Project-based learning (PBL) aims to foster students’ problem-solving ability and collaboration by engaging them in completing a project in teams. Researchers have indicated the importance of guiding students to make comparisons and reflection during the process of project-based learning. Therefore, the present research proposed a peer assessment-based PBL (PA-PBL) approach to boost students’ PBL performances. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted for 3 weeks. A total of 110 secondary students were divided into an experimental group learning with the PA-PBL approach and a control group learning with the conventional PBL (C-PBL) approach. The students’ problem-solving tendency, learning achievement, and collaboration tendency were evaluated. The experimental results indicated that the PA-PBL approach improved the students’ learning achievement, especially for those students with higher problem-solving tendency. In terms of collaboration tendency, it was found that the PA-PBL approach benefited the lower problem-solving tendency students more than the C-PBL approach, while there was no difference between the higher problem-solving tendency students in the two groups. The experimental results also indicated that the PA-PBL approach could better enhance students’ problem-solving tendencies than the C-PBL approach.}

abstract = {In order to eliminate the shortcomings of traditional classroom teaching, such as neglecting student-centeredness, lack of teaching resources, and outdated teaching evaluation methods, and to comprehensively improve the quality of classroom teaching, taking the computer application foundation course as an example, this paper takes enterprise-level office demands as the entry point, combines enterprise office cases with teaching, integrates ideological and political materials to reconstruct teaching content, and incorporates the characteristics of the Chaoxing Learning Platform. Based on the premise of front-end analysis, this paper carries out teaching design from the three aspects of pre-class, in-class, and after-class, and implements a blended teaching practice based on Chaoxing. The results show that after adopting this teaching method, students’ overall course grades have increased significantly from 77.79 to 84.99, and the classroom teaching effect has also been enhanced. The reform of this course has been highly recognized by students, promoting the cultivation of undergraduate students’ innovative abilities while also comprehensively enhancing their proactivity and scientific literacy.}

abstract = {Although the current landscape in education emphasizes the importance of developing students’ information literacy in formal education settings, little attention has been paid to information literacy within the context of social media use. This study investigated the relationship between information literacy and social media competence (SMC) among 1843 university students. This was done in order to increase knowledge of the components that may be important for preparing university students to be information literate citizens in social media environments. Students’ information literacy and SMC were measured by the Student Information Literacy Test and the SMC-CS scale respectively. Correlation and regression analyses were utilized to explore the relationship between university students’ information literacy and their SMC. The results showed that university students’ ability to utilize information technology to solve problems, and their sense of responsible behavior in cyberspace, are the most critical factors in predicting students’ SMC. Based on the findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of enhancing university students’ information literacy and SMC.}

  abstract={The concept of computational thinking is timely. It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.},

  abstract={With the introduction of computer programming in schools around the world, Scratch has risen in prominence for its thinkable, meaningful and social. Aiming to assessing the Computational Thinking skills of a Scratch program, we design and implement a new Scratch program analysis tool based on ANTLR. To solve some flaws (e.g., high failure rate and low efficiency) in Dr. Scratch which is the most relevant tool to assess Computational Thinking skills of Scratch programs, we choose the recognition tool ANTLR to design the system module and the assessing flow. And then, we customize more than 200 lexical and syntax parser rules in ANTLR. Furthermore, we expand the grading standard of assessing Computational Thinking skills in Dr. Scratch. Some fundamental concepts in Computer Science, such as stack, queue and recursion method, are involved in our grading standard. Experiment results show the performance (e.g., success rate, execution time) of SAT is superior to that of Dr. Scratch.},

  abstract={In recent years, engineering education has become one of the challenging issues in Thailand education. By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.},

  abstract={Recent trends in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education are focused on developing problem-solving skills and computational thinking and empowering students with the STEM discipline's knowledge to solve real-world problems. STEM incorporates an interdisciplinary approach that includes inquiry, analysis, critical thinking, practical experimentation, and cooperative problem-solving. Technological advancements are offering new ways to integrate new tools such as drones, robotics and gaming in teaching and learning practices and modify the pedagogical approaches that are more appealing and engaging. This paper presents an innovative pedagogical approach and practice that integrate drone technology and block-based programming to foster students' computation thinking in a STEM context. The block-based visual programming languages provide an interactive environment to connect the blocks and write programs. The study was conducted in six Australian schools. Students were assigned projects to automate drones using the DroneBlocks app and make programs to fly the drone in different geometrical patterns; straight line, arch, rectangle, triangles and zig-zag and integrate the various manoeuvres; bounce, 8D flips, and throw & go along flight paths. Students' computational thinking development was examined with an emphasis on their performance in formulating and problem-solving. Results have shown that integrated drone and programming pedagogy contributed significantly to students' learning of developing computational thinking for problem-solving and decomposing a problem into smaller parts in a sequence that includes mathematical algorithms to write programs.},

  abstract={Studies with augmented reality show that while the technology helps the student learn, it may end up disturbing other points, showing that more research is needed with the use of augmented reality. Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper's main contribution is showing one possibility of using AR with Computational Thinking and what needs to evolve for it to be used by the usable by the children.},

  abstract={Complex problem solving is one of the key skills for future jobs, but it has not been clearly operationalized. We hypothesized that it is a construct of inquiry, computational thinking, and mathematical problem solving. The hypothesis was empirically tested by administering tests to 261 high school students for assessing three inquiry skills, two dimensions of computational thinking and five mathematical problem solving skills. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a three factor model of inquiry skills and two factor model of computational thinking skills to have a good fit. Mathematical problem solving skills were characterized with a two factor model. These factors were combined in a higher-order factor model into one construct that could be defined as a complex problem solving skill.},

The teaching process is task-oriented, teacher-led and student-centered. In the whole teaching process, teachers use the way of integrating computational thinking with practical thinking to prepare courses, design tasks and guide students to complete learning tasks. Compared with the traditional teaching mode, the teaching mode of integrating computational thinking and practical thinking has made great progress in training students' computer practical ability and innovation ability. It can not only improve learning efficiency, but also train students' computer practical ability. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of this method are verified by Java Web course design.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become a interesting subject and important concept in education throughout the nation. Computational Thinking (CT) has been defined as an important skill as digital literacy that must be learned by next generation. Along with the need to make an agreed definition of CT many countries are still in the process of, or have not started, introducing CT into the curriculum at all levels of education. It was also found in Indonesia that Computer Science / Computing, which could be the most obvious place to teach CT, has not been the main subject in several schools. This research aim is to design an alternative CT learning media to study interestingly and effectively computational concept which consists of 4 elements, namely decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm. Research and Development followed by ADDIE development model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) is used to capture the problem, identify the user need to be implemented in digital media. This learning media application product is equipped with an educational game based on computational thinking. The media has several features such as presentation of material and examples of problems and the solution, and small challenges in a games consisting of 3 stages. The subjects of this study were students of K-12. The data used for analysis was collected in several ways, including observation, questionnaire, pre-test and post-test in similar question. The result is the use of CT learning media is very helpful to improve students' understanding of CT in problem solving even in different topics.},

Game-based learning has recently seen an increase in prevalence for teaching computational thinking, making games an important topic of study. However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning. It concludes with a potential use case to demonstrate how the methods can be combined to achieve a granular and actionable understanding of a complex CT assessment problem and its causes.},

  abstract={Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.},

  abstract={The development of computational thinking skills through computer programming is a major topic in education, as governments around the world are introducing these skills in the school curriculum. In consequence, educators and students are facing this discipline for the first time. Although there are many technologies that assist teachers and learners in the learning of this competence, there is a lack of tools that support them in the assessment tasks. This paper compares the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch, a free/libre/open source software assessment tool for Scratch, with McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead's metrics, two classic software engineering metrics that are globally recognized as a valid measurement for the complexity of a software system. The findings, which prove positive, significant, moderate to strong correlations between them, could be therefore considered as a validation of the complexity assessment process of Dr. Scratch.},

Lots of these initiatives, however, have been conceived to address the shortage of professionals in the technology sector, an approach that is encouraged by the software industry. On the contrary, this article argues that the focus should swift towards computational thinking, an ability that goes far beyond computer science or technology, fostering fundamental skills for the citizens of the twenty-first century. In this paper we summarize the findings of recent investigations that study computational thinking from different perspectives, explaining what this new skill is made of, presenting outcomes of school interventions showing relationships between the development of this ability and improvements in different subjects and soft skills, presenting technologies to foster its development, and reviewing tools that support educators in the assessment of this skill.},

  abstract={Programming is one of the key assets in the modern society. In addition to teaching programming to future programmers, it has become more and more important to teach it alongside computational thinking to all students. We designed and implemented a programming course aimed for teacher students at our university. The goal of the course was to teach programming, computational thinking and the methods and tools used in programming education. The course was divided into two parts: first, the students were taught basic programming skills by utilizing tutorial-based learning with automatically assessed electronic exercises and play-based programming tasks. In the second part, the students utilized the acquired skills by teaching programming integrated into mathematics to children at elementary school level. The students worked really hard throughout the course, completing more than 90 % of all tasks in average. Moreover, the feedback from the tutorial sessions and the practice lessons at schools was mainly positive.},

  abstract={This Work-in-Progress study focuses on computational thinking (CT) in children. Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are currently underrepresented in STEM education and careers. However, providing appropriate early CT learning opportunities can potentially help learners develop both interest and self-efficacy in computer science and STEM fields.Our research aims to characterize computational thinking and engineering thinking for K-2 aged children. In this paper, we report on our findings of children exploring a recently installed exhibit at a local Midwestern science center. The exhibit was designed to help children learn about engineering careers and CT, and provides different learning activities to elicit CT in children from diverse learning groups. The exhibit provides information about different engineering disciplines/fields, and examples of engineers from diverse groups (i.e. it includes images of people of different races, ethnicities, gender, and ability).In this study, we audio- and video-recorded families while they explored the exhibit. They then participated in interviews and completed surveys. The video data provided evidence that children can engage in a range of CT competencies in the computer-supported coding game. Our findings can help us further consider how families can support children as they learn CT skills in out-of-school environments.},

  abstract={Identifying engaging programming tasks to teach computational thinking and programming skills, especially to students of post-secondary education, is a challenging problem for lecturers. Physical computing is a potential solution that provides ample opportunities for creative development of such skills. The availability of pre-assembled physical computing tool kits often do not offer the right level of abstraction and flexibility to suit educator's needs. Consequently, this paper presents the design of a custom physical computing tool kit, T{h}inker, primarily for learning and teaching computational thinking and programming skills. Prior to design discussions, the context and motivation behind designing T{h}inker has been presented. Preliminary pilot deployment sessions of T{h}inker for both teachers and students confirm its potential as an effective tool for both teaching and learning of thinking skills.},

  abstract={Some curriculum of making computer games were developed to engage students in digital game-making activities so as to enhance their computational thinking skills during the last few years. The findings of those studies are quite positive, especially concerning the promotion of computational thinking skills. However, many students seem to face difficulties in the processes of the game development, such as debugging, applying mathematics, or physics subjects. Additionally, students often have solved the problems and understood concepts, mainly math formulas and physics concepts, alone while creating their games. This study presents an innovative curriculum design that suggests two students playing different role to make motion-based touchless games (i.e., games that are based on natural user interaction technologies, like the Microsoft Kinect camera or Leap Motion). Based on the requirements of the innovative curriculum and interaction technologies, students can naturally fulfill the ideal of pair programming and get various benefits from each other.},

A 4-week experimental study was conducted to evaluate the usability of the online platform. A total of 79 9th-grade students volunteered to participate in this study to complete six activities. Subsequently, the students completed the SUS questionnaire and open-ended feedback questions. Results showed that around 80% of the students scored above the ‚ÄúGood‚Äù category (70-80), with a total average score of 78.45. Also, we analyzed the difference in rating scores among groups based on multiple background factors. Findings showed an average rating above 4 with no significant difference between the ratings among factors such as gender and math performance (below-above average math scores). In addition, analysis of the feedback comments showed that the platform is user-friendly, with students enthusiastic about learning coding on the platform.},

  abstract={Currently we see globalization and technological advances accelerating worldwide, transforming the world of work and human coexistence. We still notice that the educational systems, in their majority, are disconnected from these global realities. In this sense, it is necessary to have an educational formation more aligned to the contemporary world, preparing young people for the challenges of the 21st century, how to deal with technological resources and processes, developing soft and hard skills. In this way, it can be observed that in recent years computational thinking has gained relevance in this scenario, being a field of research in the most varied areas of knowledge, developing communication skills, creativity, leadership, problem solving, familiarity with technologies, management, transforming young people into autonomous individuals who are prepared for the technological changes that the world requires. Taking these transformations as a reference, this paper describes/presents the development of an online tool to stimulate computational thinking in elementary school, through online games. he use of the ThinkinGame makes it possible to identify the pillars to be worked on with young people, after its use, thus improving the approaches to be given in the formation of these young people, being able to turn attention to the challenge of teaching additional skills, such as sophisticated thinking and flexible problem solving.},

  abstract={STEAM education has been paid much attention currently for fostering the interdisciplinary thinking abilities. However, the current learning content of STEAM almost focuses on the learning of STEM subjects and the cultivation of the Computational Thinking (CT), so the learning of ART subject is insufficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a Scheme of STEAM Interactive Learning Toy for Musical Thinking (MT) and Computational Thinking (ILT-MCT), to engage primary level elementary students in learning knowledge and concepts of the MT and CT both. In ILT-MCT scheme, children read the paper-based learning content (learning book) to learn the concepts of MT and CT, interact with a Mobile-based learning toy using substantial Programming Blocks, and further play the digital game-based learning content via the learning toy to enhance the learning motivation.},

  abstract={In this work we, study the self-efficacy of the use of the Choreographe software in block programming using the NAO robot in order to develop instructional videos in the classroom within the framework of Computational Thinking. The put forward objectives were three; (1) Evaluate the level of significance of self-efficacy and the applicability of CT concepts. (2) Measure the relationship between the applicability of CT concepts with the ease of use, usefulness, attitude and intention to work in the future with an instructional program. (3) Establish the percentages and means of the items of the variables concepts CT and self-efficacy. Thus, from a quantitative approach, we propose to create a questionnaire to measure self-efficacy and the level of knowledge acquired in block programming. 4 practical workshops of 2 hours each have been carried out with 28 initial training students between the ages of 23 and 27. The results yielded a positive correlation between the variables self-efficacy and computational thinking. Highlighting a positive acceptance of self-efficacy in the use of Choreographe software in the block programming experience and a growing ascendancy of interaction.},

  abstract={Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.},

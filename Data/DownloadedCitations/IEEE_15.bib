  abstract={At present, there is still a lack of suitable artificial intelligence curriculum in primary and secondary schools in China. Based on a project-based learning model, an artificial intelligence course was designed for middle school-aged students. Learning objectives were deconstructed according to the five concepts of artificial intelligence, and learning contents were arranged according to the cognitive characteristics of middle school students. In the process of teaching, the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability was paid great attention, and teaching example was given at the end of the paper.},

  abstract={In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.},

This improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.},

  abstract={Can digital competencies be acquired by solving real problems? The educational intervention MadeByKids called an external educational provider to 17 schools to conduct a series of workshops, having pupils age 7 - 12 solve challenges such as designing the schoolbag 4.0 or the future classroom. The workshops were designed by adopting the Stanford Design Thinking Method for Kids (http://www.ideaco.org) and digital technologies with the goal to “teach” children computational thinking, collaborating in teams, resolving conflicts, presenting, giving/receiving feedback, etc. In this paper, we take a participatory action research (PAR) approach with the goal of exposing significant chunks of the incredibly rich experience. A content analysis of a qualitative survey among teachers and findings from a focus group reflect the teachers' view. The study indicates that the acquisition of digital competences needs to be backed by personal and social capacities that take time to mature. Furthermore, we learned that the children's teachers must be included consistently to ensure their cooperation and improve sustainability. Besides providing inspiration for teachers, implications for teacher education are derived and the national project is related to the findings from studies conducted abroad in order to contribute to constructive educational innovations crossing national boundaries.},

  abstract={Scratch enables children to learn about programming by creating games and animations, and is currently one of the most popular introductory programming languages. While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience in teaching an introductory programming course in Python by using a visual programming development environment based on flow-charts and active learning with an interactive eBook. The field of computer science education is always being challenged with the high attrition rates despite the ever growing industry demand for computing expertise. The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles. For evaluation of learning outcomes based on the quantifiable criteria with robust statistical analysis, eleven sections of the course over three semesters were considered. The initial evaluation of summative assessment and analysis of a survey result enable us to conclude that the proposed instructional approach increases student engagement, facilitate learning and contribute to the progress of students in this course.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pedagogical practice for technical high school students for developing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities through Internet of Things technologies. The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation. The experience was considered successful in its planning and application, with a positive evaluation of the participating students.},

  abstract={The process of implementing coding at schools attended by pupils from six to fourteen years of age is a current trend in developed countries. In some cases, simple activities involving coding might be even included at kindergartens attended by children from three years of age. The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual. There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools.},

  abstract={Japan's elementary school educators are facing the difficult task of teaching computer programming education and computational thinking in a playful way which affords students' time to acquire new knowledge while discovering new technology. Japan as a nation has constantly ranked lower than other developed nations in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy. The recent introduction of programming education has created an additional task for educators to learn about programming in order to teach it. Programming education was introduced in April 2020, and little research has been done to measure the knowledge gap of educators. In March 2020, a month before the implementation of programming instruction in Japanese schools, 22 elementary schools were visited to access readiness and to distribute an online survey. The surveys and informal interviews revealed the unpreparedness of educators for the task of teaching programming and limited programming material in the approved textbooks. This research is intended to inform stakeholders in order to improve the fundamental training of in-service and pre-service educators so they can have the necessary knowledge and confidence to teach programming in a fun and playful manner to their students.},

  abstract={This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem.},

  abstract={Programming, most recently in the form of Computational Thinking (CT), is emerging as a new subject in primary schools worldwide. By data-based decision making, teachers, as learning designers, make decisions on instruction design based on a broad range of evidence, such as student assessment scores and classroom teaching observations. Given the current limitations on conclusive, field-proven teaching practices and an underlying “culture” to use as a basis, we turn to pertinent empirical studies that the growing scientific interest on introducing programming in primary school curricula has produced. The hypothesis is that we may overcome the lack of extensive experience in designing a programming course by reviewing the above evidence, in order to frame learning situations and methods.},

  abstract={This work contributes to the comprehension of Bayes’ theorem inclusive Bayesian probabilities and Bayesian inferencing within the framework of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) and cognitive learning w.r.t Bloom’s taxonomy (BT). Bayes’ theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes’ mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model. The proposed model is named the Bayesian Computational Learning Model (BCLM). Subsequently, we have probed the utility of BCLM in the design and plan of learning activities, coherent to the STEM paradigm and BT cognitive learning hierarchy.},

  abstract={This work-in-progress paper introduces an innovative approach that uses computational notebooks to teach Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate course to aid the understanding of complex phenomena in Mechanics of Materials, and enhance students' computational thinking skills. Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills. Early exposure to coding, modeling, and simulation techniques is crucial in preparing students for the computational demands of modern engineering workplaces.},

  abstract={Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners’ interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.},

  abstract={Algorithm has been heavily used to provide a comfort life for us: from finding the best route in Google map to biometrics authentication on your phone. The significant of algorithm defines Computational thinking (CT) as one of the 21st Century skills. Although CT has been integrated into the education in the past years, many students still struggle with CT concept due to the complication of the topic and limited learning methods provided in school environment. To provide alternative learning approach for algorithmic thinking, we propose a game-base learning system called Protobot. Protobot requires students to apply their CT knowledge, especially the algorithmic thinking to solve problems in the gameplay. The experimental results demonstrate that Protobot fosters the algorithmic thinking skill of the players as well as provides the amusement during the gameplay.},

  abstract={Playing video games on personal computers is known as PC gaming. PC games are available in a variety of genres, offer both single-player and multiplayer options, and have spawned an international e-sports industry. Modding communities are active, digital distribution systems are essential, and hardware can be customized. Future developments in gaming, such as virtual reality, cloud gaming, and artificial intelligence, portend more innovation in the industry. The game, Plants vs Zombies is represented by Finite Automata and it is ruled by DFAs and NFAs which describe the actions and behaviours of both the plants and the zombies and the result of their actions. In the proposed work you can notice how the NFA will be converted to DFA and vice versa due to its handy functions. Overall, "Plants vs Zombies" is a fun and interactive way for players to explore computational thinking while learning about the complex ideas of NFA and DFA in Automata Theory. The advantages are Synchronize State Management, Consistent State Transitions, Easier Development, and Unambiguous Animation Staging.},

  abstract={Computer science education in primary and secondary schools uses the. visual programming language "Scratch " to learn computational thinking. However, the limited number of course hours and overwhelmed teachers delay students’ learning progression. Although many Scratch instructional videos are available online, students still fail because of a lack of keyword-searching ability. Given this learning dilemma, we use the existing teaching videos online as hints assisting students in learning "Scratch." This project uses OpenCV to record the program blocks and analyze the behavioral intentions, and then compares and analyzes it with the video content to recommend and mark relevant segments that students need. We believe that through this recommendation system, intelligent hints in the form of videos can cultivate students’ self-learning ability and improve current teaching adversity.},

The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate that the use of the Scratch language presented better results during the initial stages; as the complexity of the content increased, the use of the pseudocode produced better results.

  abstract={Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.},

  abstract={There has been a limited number of studies in which a computing curriculum is designed and developed for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but no study has tested the effectiveness of an accessible computing curriculum for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct. When the correlations between CTCs and sessions for individual groups (PDMS & RCA) were analyzed, both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in increasing scores of synchronization and all CTCs as a single construct. The accessible and the original CT curriculums were also statistically significantly effective in improving students' learning of data representation and abstraction, respectively.},

This paper addresses the need to create tools that effectively support the learning of programming and the development of computational thinking, highlighting why video games can be an effective educational tool for it and also attract new students to STEM. The Game4Coding Erasmus+ project proposes the design of a video game called CodeQuest, using a game genre that has not been frequently used before to address the teaching of programming, the monster tamer genre. We consider that video games have a number of benefits such as that stimulate active learning, are engaging for a wide range of students, and present information in a way that is attractive to learners. We want to explore this kind of game's effectiveness as a learning tool as well as its effect on the perception of STEM disciplines and programming to attract new public to coding (especially girls).},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work-in-progress research paper presents the preliminary results of a study exploring the effectiveness of using computational notebooks to enhance student learning in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course for undergraduate Mechanical Engineering students. Our previous work has shown that students often face difficulties in grasping abstract concepts from mechanics of materials while simultaneously learning computational modeling. However, students recognized several advantages of using MATLAB for FEA compared to manual calculations, including significant time savings, increased efficiency, and reduced errors. Nevertheless, they also faced challenges, including a steep learning curve for MATLAB and concerns about how this limitation hinders their conceptual understanding. Despite these drawbacks, they recognized the importance and value of developing computational skills for their future careers. In this study, we extended the scaffolds and changed the sequence of activities to address the challenges the students faced in the previous iteration of our work. Specifically, we provided worked examples that students needed to use, self-explain, and modify before they engaged in programming from scratch. Also, after developing a basic understanding of how to implement FEA in MATLAB, the students used ChatGPT to generate a code that would do the same task. This activity required them to evaluate and refine automatically generated MATLAB code, as ChatGPT may provide alternative solutions that might not always work correctly. We explore three main topics to understand student experiences with and perceptions of this approach: (1) the value of using computational methods compared to manual completion for FEA; (2) the challenges and support of using MATLAB for FEA; and (3) the effectiveness of simulation tools to learn FEA. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) supporting student learning of intricate phenomena explored in mechanics of materials, like distribution of stress, and stiffness, and (2) fostering essential computational thinking skills through practical disciplinary coding experience. By implementing these elements, the study anticipates a substantial improvement in students' understanding of FEA principles and their ability to translate them into solutions for real-world engineering challenges.},

  abstract={Teaching autonomous and intelligent transportation systems in higher education has traditionally focused on theory, often lacking comprehensive coverage of the practical techniques required for real-world applications. To overcome this, we developed a new university course centered around hands-on learning with a modular autonomous small-scale vehicle platform called F1TENTH. This paper presents a detailed overview of the new course design, its underlying philosophy, the individual teaching modules, and the modular hardware/software of the F1TENTH platform. This new course was then evaluated with a survey conducted at five universities that have adopted the teaching modules for their semester-long undergraduate and graduate courses. The results show that approximately 80% of all involved students strongly agree that the hardware platform and modules significantly increased their motivation to learn. More than 70% of the students agreed that the hardware enhanced their understanding of the material The findings demonstrate that our course setup and the F1TENTH hardware effectively combine theoretical knowledge with practical application, greatly enhancing the educational outcomes and the students' computational thinking skills. Future research is needed to explore the long-term impact of hands-on learning on students' career development in intelligent autonomous systems.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been widely integrated into K-12 classrooms through programming education. Numerous initiatives have been developed to lower down the threshold for learning programming, yet instructors may still feel ill-prepared. Blended learning approach, a combination of student-centered learning and teacher-centered instruction, has proved to be an effective teaching approach for K-12 programming courses. With the purpose of providing practical insights for the design of blended programming lessons, this study introduced an instructional unit of a K-12 programming course in a secondary school in China. It elaborated the course regarding lesson design, learning assessment, and course evaluation. The course contains 9 plugged sessions and 24 unplugged sessions, and each session consists of 1) a preview, 2) hands-on activities, and 3) a lesson summary. Student learning was evaluated with performance-based assessments, and a questionnaire was employed to collect students’ feedback for the course. The results indicated that students with low performance were the benefit the most from the course, and students tended to like visual programming tool and stage-mode learning format. Also, students with different learning backgrounds showed different preferences for the instructional elements. Suggestions are provided for further research and course design practices.},

  abstract={A Python-based lab activity was developed for a remote Thermodynamics course to add computational thinking to traditional analytical problem solving. Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers. Nevertheless, the positive learning outcomes were encouraging. Whether students pursue a career in thermodynamics or in a broader engineering field, this lab experience equipped them with tools that can augment their engineering skills.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents an approach to improve teaching materials and assessment tools for K-12 programming education together by creating a virtuous cycle. Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.},

  abstract={Automatic assessment of learner competencies is a fundamental task in intelligent tutoring systems. An assessment rubric typically and effectively describes relevant competencies and competence levels. This paper presents an approach to deriving a learner model directly from an assessment rubric defining some (partial) ordering of competence levels. The model is based on Bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills. The simple elicitation of the model starting from the assessment rubric opens up the possibility of quickly automating the assessment of several tasks, making them more easily exploitable in the context of adaptive assessment tools and intelligent tntorino systems.},

  abstract={Our study is set in an educational context: to better teach and assess 21st-century skills, such as computational thinking or creative problem solving, we propose to formalize a specific activity that involves these competencies. This activity, referred to as #CreaCube, is presented as an open-ended problem which consists of assembling a set of robotic cubes into an autonomous vehicle. We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving activity is part of an exploratory research action. In addition, an effective proof of concept is described in this study.},

  abstract={Understanding computing concepts is one of the foundational elements of computational thinking, which helps students formulate logic and algorithms for effectively developing and designing codes. However, novice learners often struggle to understand basic computing concepts, such as variables, loops, arrays, conditionals, and functions. This is often caused by the invisibility of the computing mechanism and the complexity of language syntax and conventions. Moreover, challenges in learning computing concepts can be compounded for learners with atypical conditions (e.g. visual, cognitive, and learning impairment, attention deficit, and neurodivergence). To tackle this, teachers of typical ability learners frequently use notional machines (NMs) - simplified representations (e.g. diagrams, flow charts, and analogies) created to assist novice programmers in understanding abstract concepts, program execution, and dynamics. In addition, traditional learning activities may need assistive learning interventions (ALIs) and learner-oriented practices like physical tactile models, computing artifacts, and interactive learning tools. NM approaches tend to focus on the explanation of concepts from instructor to learner, while ALIs tend to focus on learner support in activities. Both methods can provide advantages for learning, and we expect that a combined approach would provide even greater synergy for all learners. However, little consideration has been given to how NM and ALI approaches could be effectively combined. This research investigates how NM and ALI can be effectively brought together more holistically as an inclusive pedagogical tool - notional machines for inclusive learning (NMIL). In this full paper, we develop the conceptualization of NMIL, grounded in previous NM and ALI research. We also propose a structured method for creating NMIL. Finally, we also develop a physical NMIL model, based on the structured NMIL creation method, to teach lists in Python, as part of an introductory computer science course.},

  pages={517-528},
  abstract={As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In today's growing digital era, young students' emphasis on science and technology has multi-folded into the development of computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving mindset, and better learning outcomes. Traditionally, young children who tend to perform well academically are expected to become more successful in their careers rather than the skill set they learn and develop their cognition for better opportunities. On the contrary, skill set also plays a significant role in enhancing student engagement towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. Implementing educational robots and artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms as teaching tools represents a transformative approach to modern teaching methods. Incorporating a fun-based, hands-on learning environment using programming, designing, and problem-solving tasks for students to enhance their cognitive abilities can stimulate curiosity and innovation among them. The novelty of this study is that it analyses two case studies on introducing robotics and artificial intelligence among school children of rural-based schools in Assam, India, which enhances the participating students' self-efficacy, technical knowledge, and problem-solving attitude. This study aims to analyze the impact of an enhanced learning approach on school students regarding knowledge gain, self-worth, and innovative thinking compared to traditional teaching methods. Academicians from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati have been a part of the sessions provided to children. The data collection and analysis have been approved by the participants and their school teachers. A set of questions was developed to understand some knowledge-based and perception-based parameters through pre/post-tests and draw-a-robot activity. This study demonstrates positive effect sizes (cohen’s d = 1.64 and 5.41) from both case studies and statistic t-values to support the alternate hypothesis on a greater effect of implementing enhanced teaching methods for STEM education.},

  abstract={The evolution of the Internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems, such as Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. These results were superior to existing IDS frameworks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={83639-83665},
  abstract={Owing to the no free lunch theorem, no single optimisation algorithm can solve all optimisation problems accurately, so new optimisation techniques are required. In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (DSO) is proposed. The deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test. Lastly, the DSO is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including GA, PSO, TLBO, and GWO. The DSO fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics.},

  abstract={The need for critically reflecting on the deceptive nature of advanced technologies, such as social robots, is urging academia and civil society to rethink education and the skills needed by future generations. The promotion of critical thinking, however, remains largely unaddressed within the field of educational robotics. To address this gap and question if and how robots can be used to promote critical thinking in young children's education, we conducted an explorative design study named Bringing Shybo Home. Through this study, in which a robot was used as a springboard for debate with twenty 8- to 9-year-old children at school, we exemplify how the deceptive nature of robots, if embraced and magnified in order for it to become explicitly controversial, can be used to nurture children's critical mindset.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={116011-116025},
  abstract={Cloud computing is a technology for efficiently using computing infrastructures and a business model for selling computing resources and services. However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605. The SecFedIDM-V1 can be deployed alongside Firewalls in a federated cloud computing environment to reinforce the security of the infrastructure.},

  year={2023},
  volume={114},

  abstract={In this study, the specific absorption rate (SAR) and exposure index (EI) of access points (APs) and user equipment (UEs) in fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies are examined with regard to the effects of exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation and the implications of their reduction. We characterize the EI using a classical mathematical method while considering the power density, the SAR, the electric field strength, and the tissue's density and conductivity. As such, a novel exposure-index open-loop power control algorithm is proposed to evaluate the realistic RF-EMF radiation exposure on human users from both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication devices. To solve an EI minimization problem using the open-loop power control algorithm, we formulate it in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. As the energy capacity (i.e., power density) in wireless networks determines the radiation exposure (SAR and EI), it minimizes the EI by controlling and managing the transmitted and received powers under the restrictions of Quality of Service (QoS), interference, and power, while ensuring the users' QoS requirements are met. Our proposed scheme is numerically compared to other heuristic algorithms and exposure limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and other similar organizations. Lastly, we compare the emissions from 4G and 5G networks to the emissions from UL and DL transmissions. Our simulation findings indicate that our proposed technique is a good alternative. Our assessment, in terms of numerical results and evaluation, also verifies that the exposures are bearable, fall within the recommended limits, and are minimized without impairing the users' QoS.},

We observed the behavior and attitudes of 42 children from three age groups: 6-7 years, 8-10 years, and 10-12 years. Through our observations, we identified six different types of surprising robot behaviors: personality, movement malfunctions, inconsistent behavior, mispronunciation, delays, and freezing. Using a qualitative analysis, we examined how children responded to each type of behavior, and we observed similarities and differences between the age groups. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for designing age-appropriate learning interactions with social robots.},

  abstract={A software product line models the variability of highly configurable systems. Complete exploration of all valid configurations (the configuration space) is infeasible as it grows exponentially with the number of features in the worst case. In practice, few representative configurations are sampled instead, which may be used for software testing or hardware verification. Pseudo-randomness of modern computers introduces statistical bias into these samples. Quantum computing enables truly random, uniform configuration sampling based on inherently random quantum physical effects. We propose a method to encode the entire configuration space in a superposition and then measure one random sample. We show the method's uniformity over multiple samples and investigate its scale for different feature models. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of quantum computing for uniform random sampling regarding current and future quantum hardware.},

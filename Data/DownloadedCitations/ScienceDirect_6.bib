abstract = {Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has been the focus of significant attention in recent years because of its growing social importance and pedagogical value. In Hong Kong, an increasing number of K-12 schools are planning or piloting their grassroots AIED incorporation practices. However, progress is reportedly slow due to a number of barriers. Unfortunately, because of their limited scope, disputed interpretations and contextual irrelevance, current research literature seems to be of limited referencing value in aiding schools to address the issues and overcome the barriers. This paper highlights the necessity of embracing AIED as wide-ranging given the current understanding of it as a collective notion. Three major directions of AIED are identified: Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI. A collective case study, which examined the perceived barriers to AIED incorporation in Hong Kong K-12 schools with different AIED directions, was conducted. Qualitative data were gathered via ten semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from two schools. Ertmer’s (1999) typology was applied to segregate the barriers. The findings showed that both first-order and second-order barriers existed, although they varied between the cases. It was also found that the barriers did not hinder in isolation but appeared to be interconnected. The findings suggest that schools use differentiated strategies to tackle barriers according to their approach to incorporating AIED. Moreover, there is a need to trace the links between barriers and prioritise school efforts to remove or reduce them with high linkage. Several recommendations for practice are given.}

The objective of the study was to examine international students’ changing conceptual understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy as part of the course. The need for this study arose from the recent rapid spread of AI across industries, which has connected human learning to machine learning. This requires competence in AI to contribute to future society. Five hours of online lectures on AI literacy were delivered during two workshops to students (N = 29) from 13 countries with no or limited prior knowledge of the subject in 2021 and 2022. The participants filled out pre- and post-workshop quantitative questionnaires and wrote diaries about their learning process, the development of their understanding of AI-literacy concepts, and their thoughts on the pedagogical approaches used. The quantitative data were analysed using a paired-samples t-test, while the qualitative data were examined using thematic-content analysis. The findings show that the students’ knowledge of AI and their awareness of the importance of AI literacy and media education increased significantly. Further research is needed so that a more appropriate curriculum can be designed for them. We outline some key activities that offer interactive and participatory ways to learn AI in order to assist educators in planning and delivering AI-literacy courses as part of cross-cultural media education.}

abstract = {Purpose
In a socio-educational context impregnated by social networks, feminist organizations and individuals have turned to social media to spread their knowledge. This paper aims to approach how feminist tweets are produced to ignite meaningful informal learning (IL) processes.
Design/methodology/approach
This study uses an interdisciplinary mixed methodology. By using Twitter tracking tools, a database has been enabled to catalogue feminist hashtags into topics and categories for further analysis. These data have been contrasted with surveys to the managers of the most followed feminist accounts in Spain and Catalonia.
Findings
From an educational perspective, the analysed feminist hashtags have been organized in 13 different topic categories. The different propagation processes on Twitter – tweeting and retweeting – imply diverse learning processes. Moreover, tweets with complementary information such as images or links generate the most interaction, being the preferred format for IL.
Research limitations/implications
Researching with Big Data in educational sciences is a field in development, and Twitter data collection tools are mostly addressed to marketing and economic sectors; thus, free tools with limited services were used, offering the analysis of a brief and concrete situation of a platform in constant change. Although this ephemeral data and its relevance does not prevail over time, it has an impact on citizens’ learning.
Originality/value
It is the first study in Spain that illustrates the informal education that feminism offers to the community, facing the complexity of measuring Twitter with an educational perspective through the use of marketing tools.}

abstract = {This study aims to address inefficiencies and errors in current manual rebar practices within the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, which contribute to significant rebar waste. The Design-Bid-Build (DBB) project delivery method further exacerbates these issues by hindering effective stakeholder collaboration. By contrast, integrated project delivery and building information modeling (BIM) have shown potential for enhanced coordination and waste reduction. Yet, the continued reliance on manual rebar modeling in BIM highlights a pressing need for intelligent automation. This study presents a novel BIM-based algorithm that leverages Dynamo for rebar layout optimization and Navisworks for automatic clash detection, integrating rebar optimization prior to BIM model creation to minimize data exchange errors. The methodology was validated on a continuous-column rebar arrangement, supported by a standardized rebar summary sheet to streamline the optimization and clash-detection process. Key findings indicate that this approach significantly reduces working hours while achieving high modeling accuracy compared to traditional manual methods. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework to transform rebar layout practices, enabling smart, efficient, and sustainable construction through automated clash-free rebar layout generation.}

This review summarises teachers' perspectives on the utilisation of STEM toys in children studying in kindergarten and describes the outcomes of children's development resulting from playing with STEM toys. The present systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA-2020 checklist. The search engines used were Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, and other journal databases including ScienceDirect, Springer, Taylor & Francis etc. for papers published between 2010 and 2024. These searches yielded 2352 peer-reviewed articles. The application of the selection and rejection criteria led to the formation of a shortlisting 32 papers, following the initial evaluation. The findings revealed the various approaches that teachers can employ during play sessions with STEM toys while teaching. Kindergarten teachers take on the roles of facilitators and mediators, promote collaborative work, and encourage children to perform experiments and learn from failure. Furthermore, the findings of this study revealed that kindergarten teachers generally maintain favourable and constructive perspectives regarding the utilisation of STEM toys. The results underscore positive impacts on cognitive abilities of children like problem-solving and critical thinking, and socio-emotional skills like verbal communication from using STEM toys. Comprehensive teacher training is emphasised to identify methodologies that complement the technology, maximizing teaching-learning benefits for children's brain development.}

This study examines how creative growth mindsets, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) self-efficacy, creative environments, ICT availability, and ICT information practices influence creative self-efficacy (CSE) and creative thinking. The study conducted path analyses on 16,148 secondary school students in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, China in PISA 2022. The results showed that growth mindsets, ICT self-efficacy, and creative environments can directly promote their creative self-efficacy and thinking, while school environments negatively impact creative thinking. Besides, online information practices mediate the relationship between predictors, CSE, and creative thinking. However, ICT feedback and support do not serve as mediators for creative thinking. ICT availability at school positively affects CSE through ICT feedback, while ICT availability outside of school has a negative effect. This study highlights the combined influence of individual traits, behaviors, and external environments on students’ creative thinking, providing valuable insights for educators to take a holistic approach to fostering student development.}

Traditional manual grading is time-consuming, often inconsistent, and prone to subjective biases. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) for the automated evaluation of programming assignments. LLMs can use advanced natural language processing capabilities to assess code quality, functionality, and adherence to best practices, providing detailed feedback and grades. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs through experiments comparing their performance with human evaluators across various programming tasks. Our study evaluates the performance of several LLMs for automated grading. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves an exact match accuracy of 86% and a ±1 accuracy of 98%. GPT-4o also demonstrates strong performance, with exact match and ±1 accuracies of 69% and 97%, respectively. Both models correlate highly with human evaluations, indicating their potential for reliable automated grading. However, models such as Llama 3 70B and Mixtral 8 × 7B exhibit low accuracy and alignment with human grading, particularly in problem-solving tasks. These findings suggest that advanced LLMs are instrumental in scalable, automated educational assessment. Additionally, LLMs enhance the learning experience by offering personalized, instant feedback, fostering an iterative learning process. The findings suggest that LLMs could play a pivotal role in the future of programming education, ensuring scalability and consistency in evaluation.}

This study aims to systematically review and analyse the literature by taking a holistic approach to previous studies in order to clearly identify the gaps in the field and the steps to be taken for future studies. In this context, two different analysis methods were employed in the study. This review aims to reveal information that has not been fully captured or evaluated previously, including information related to important sources, documents, countries, and keywords used in the field. According to the results obtained from the study, the country with the highest publication performance is the United States of America, and the most cited publication source is the Journal of Thinking Skills and Creativity. The most frequently studied concepts in the documents are identified as 21st century skills, assessment, creativity, learning, teaching, teacher, education, and primary school. Another result obtained reveals that articles on critical thinking, which increased between 2015 and 2020, mostly discussed critical thinking in the fields of mathematics and science education. Studies that examine the development of critical thinking skills through the implementation of different teaching methods are particularly in the majority. According to the analysis results of the article methodologies, it is revealed that the majority are based on the qualitative research approach, the criterion sampling method is used with small sample groups, and the most preferred data collection tool is the document. In addition to revealing the current status regarding the research tendencies of critical thinking in primary education, these results have the potential to guide researchers, countries and primary school teachers working in the field.}

CONPES 3988 draws a strong focus on educational ‘innovation’, which is explicitly conceptualised through digital technology, understood as the transformation of traditional educational practices through educational technologies to improve educational quality. CONPES 3988 establishes the actions needed to realise a process of educational innovation through educational technologies and has four pillars: to increase access to digital technologies for the creation of innovative learning spaces, to improve Internet connectivity of official educational institutions, to promote the appropriation of digital technologies in the educational community, and to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of the use, access and impact of digital technologies in education. CONPES 3988 draws a strong focus on educational ‘innovation’, which is explicitly conceptualised through digital technology, understood as the transformation of traditional educational practices through educational technologies to improve educational quality. CONPES 3988 captures and surfaces digital imaginaries that speak to rural education, particularly in how it is framed and performed and how digital technology use is explicitly tied to market discourses of quality, sustainability, transformation, and breaks from tradition. Rural education in Colombia, and indeed rurality itself and its attendant plurality, are potentially disadvantaged in this framing as they become transactional actors in a larger educational system framed increasingly in digital technologies emerging from the urban centres of the Colombian government. Such an analysis provides insights that extend well beyond Colombia, particularly in noting how rurality and rural education are reframed when there is policy and governance emphasis on digital technology use in education.}

Following a review of the literature on epistemic practices including examples of argumentation, modeling and explanations, we focus on teachers' learning of argumentation. An important element of teachers' understanding of argumentation in science as an epistemic practice involves how they might potentially distinguish it from argumentation in other subject domains. In other words, given a broad set of subjects can be considered from an argumentation perspective (e.g., religious education, history, English), what differentiates argumentation as an epistemic practice of science? We will address this question by contrasting how argumentation is framed broadly in epistemic practices of two contrasting school subjects: science and religious education. Following this theoretical account, we will then draw on some empirical data from the Oxford Argumentation in Religion and Science project based in England to illustrate how in-service science teachers view argumentation and engage in its teaching. Implications for curriculum reform as well as teacher education are discussed.}

The study involved a total of 231 mathematics teachers in Indonesia and a total of 384 mathematics teachers in Malaysia using simple random sampling. A survey was conducted to determine the readiness of mathematics teachers in facing the industrial revolution. This study used SEM analysis (using AMOS software) to determine the model of teacher readiness facing the era of industrial revolution such as the direct effect of mathematics teacher cooperation and readiness in facing the era of industrial revolution, the essence of ethics as mediators of the relationship between mathematics teacher cooperation and readiness in facing the era of industrial revolution. The study findings showed collaboration has significant effect on IR4.0 readiness and the direct effect of collaboration on ethics was also significant. Indirectly, ethics has a significant mediating effect in the contribution between collaboration on the readiness of IR4.0 among mathematics teachers in Indonesia and Malaysia. A partial mediator occurred in the results of this study. In conclusion, the study's implications and recommendations emphasize the importance of collaborative practices, ethics, and cross-cultural considerations in preparing mathematics teachers for the Industrial Revolution era in Indonesia and Malaysia.

Research has shown students have difficulty in moving across, connecting, and sensemaking from multiple representations. There is a need to develop task-specific representational competencies for students to reason and conduct scientific investigations using multiple representations. In this study, we focus on three representational competencies: 1) linking between representations, 2) disciplinary sensemaking from multiple representations, and 3) conceptualizing domain-relevant content derived from multiple representations. We developed a block code-based computational modeling environment with three different representations and embedded it within an online activity for students to carry out investigations around the earthquake cycle. The three representations include a procedural representation of block codes, a geometric representation of land deformation build-up, and a graphical representation of deformation build-up over time. We examined the extent of students' representational competencies and which competencies are most correlated with students’ future performance in a computationally supported geoscience investigation. Results indicate that a majority of the 431 students showed at least some form of representational competence. However, a relatively small number of students showed sophisticated levels of linking, sensemaking, and conceptualizing from the representations. Five of seven representational competencies, the most prominent being code sensemaking (η2 = 0.053, p < 0.001), were significantly correlated to student performance on a summative geoscience investigation.}

The paper also reports findings from a study examining how the STEM maker camp activities, which leveraged 3D modeling and printing practices, impacted youths’ perceptions of their disciplinary identity, engagement, and their present and future visions of the relevance of these STEM practices to themselves and their communities. The study also explores design tensions that emerged during the camp design process and identified barriers and opportunities that arose from balancing the needs of each partner, the research team’s focus on youth-centered learning, and the overall program goals.}

To understand the stratification of the net into the surface Web and the hidden Web, a model structure is proposed that provides navigation through the net as a whole. For logical expressions, a relativized evaluation map is given, which is parameterized by the indexing system. It is allowed to use concepts that are generated using partial functions, the variables of which run over the range of possible individual information processes. A generalized operator providing virtualization is presented for individuals. The process is accompanied with the dynamic generation of Web-pages, which triggers their indexing. This way they are thereby transferred to the surface layer of the network. A commutative diagram is proposed that establishes a cognitive model of semantic constructions of variable domains, the connection of virtual individuals with actual ones which corresponds to transitions over the stages of knowledge. The knowledge stages are modeled by indexing systems.}

However, gender segregation in higher education in this sector is creating a gender gap that means that for some disciplines female representation does not even reach 30% of the total. In order to propose measures to address the phenomenon, it is necessary to understand the possible causes of this issue. A systematic literature review and mapping were carried out for the study, following the PRISMA guidelines and flowchart. The research questions to be answered were (RQ1) What studies exist on the gender gap in relation to the choice of higher education in the STEM field; and (RQ2) How do gender roles and stereotypes influence decision-making related to higher education? The review of peer-reviewed scientific articles, conferences texts, books and book chapters on the European education area was applied. A total of 4571 initial results were obtained and, after the process marked by the PRISMA flowchart, the final results were reduced to 26. The results revealed that gender stereotypes are strong drivers of the gender gap in general, and the Leaky Pipeline and Stereotype Threat in particular. To narrow the gender gap, it is necessary to focus on influences from the family, the educational environment, and the peer group, as well as from the culture itself. Positive self-concept, self-efficacy, self-confidence, and self-perception need to be fostered, so that the individual chooses their studies according to their goals.}

These attacks have become increasingly threatening to modern software systems, which rely heavily on human interactions. Recent studies propose to conduct serious game-based security training against such threats. However, it is challenging to simulate real-world scenarios in serious games, making the training less effective. In this paper, we introduce Security Awareness Adventure, a novel social engineering serious game that allows participants to play the role of attackers and realistically experience the social engineering attack process from the attacker’s perspective. Our game works with state transition models to realistically simulate stakeholder interactions within specific scenarios and to capture stakeholders’ alternative behaviors using a branching system. To evaluate our game’s effectiveness, we conducted an experiment with 41 participants and a real social engineering security scenario. The experimental results show that our game can effectively improve the learner’s security awareness.}

Kenya has taken tremendous steps in adopting the use of emerging technology in different sectors of the economy. In realization of the need to have a skilled digital workforce to develop solutions using these emerging technologies, Kenya has undertaken curriculum reforms and introduced the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) which has included digital literacy and coding in elementary school. Furthermore, computer science has been introduced in Junior Secondary School. In view of these changes, teachers should be adequately prepared with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to effectively teach these new technologies. However, in Kenya, AI was not and still is not part of the teacher training curriculum. Additionally, there are inadequate professional development opportunities in AI for both pre-service and in-service teachers since AI is not part of the CBC curriculum. That notwithstanding, it is inevitable for teachers in the current world to introduce AI to learners. Therefore, this study's objectives were to assess the confidence in AI, attitudes toward AI, AI ethics, subjective norms, perceived threats, and the readiness to teach AI among Kenyan K-12 in-service teachers and to assess how these factors influence their readiness to teach AI. To achieve these objectives, this study employed a quantitative research methodology by administering a survey using Google Forms to a random sample of 308 teachers from different grades from 37 out of 47 counties in Kenya. The findings showed that confidence in AI, AI ethics and subjective norms significantly influenced AI readiness while attitude towards AI and perceived threats did not significantly influence AI readiness. These results are significant in providing a basis for education policy change on AI education in Kenya, such as transforming the teacher training curriculum to include AI and designing AI professional development programs for in-service teachers to ensure they are well-equipped to teach AI.}

abstract = {Visual diagrammatic programming and block diagrams have been indispensable tools for systems modeling and simulation across research, development, and educational fields for several decades. Despite the availability of mature commercial and free software tools, there is a lack of information publicly accessible on algorithms for processing block diagrams that represent dynamical systems and simulate the corresponding models. A gap in the existing literature is the absence of mathematically formal and complete proposals of algorithms for processing block diagrams that are multigraphs containing directed cyclic graphs, and not just simpler directed graphs. The lack of a detailed exposition concerning the practical implementation of such algorithms is also a gap. This gap is likely because the simulation systems based on block diagram descriptions that have become de facto industry standards use proprietary solutions, even if their origins can be traced back to work done in research centers and universities more than seven decades ago. In response to these challenges, this paper summarizes the historical evolution of related paradigms, such as data flow diagrams, signal flow graphs, bond graphs, and block diagrams. We propose a general algorithm for block diagram processing and present an open-source software tool for Python that implements a diagrammatic visual programming interface and the proposed block diagram processing algorithm. The key contributions to the field of systems modeling and simulation can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the exposition of the algorithm formally proving its correctness, offers transparency which facilitates further research and development in the field, enabling academics and professionals to adapt, enhance, or expand upon the existing capabilities of the tool. Secondly, the implementation of a Python library and tool released as an open-source solution for simulating signal processing and dynamical systems through block diagrams by integrating the proposed algorithm capable of efficiently handling multigraph representations, including those with directed cyclic graphs. Ensuring accessibility of the tool to researchers, developers, and educators fosters innovation, research and empowers educators by providing them with a versatile tool that can be used to teach complex systems modeling and simulation concepts in a practical, hands-on manner across various domains, such as control systems, electrical engineering, and computer science.}

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 evolution in specific geographies may help predict properties of the variants that come from these regions. We mapped neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain that evolved over 6 months from ancestral virus in a person with advanced HIV disease in South Africa; this person was infected prior to emergence of the Beta and Delta variants. We longitudinally tracked the evolved virus and tested it against self-plasma and convalescent plasma from ancestral, Beta, and Delta infections. Early virus was similar to ancestral, but it evolved a multitude of mutations found in Omicron and other variants. It showed substantial but incomplete Pfizer BNT162b2 escape, weak neutralization by self-plasma, and despite pre-dating Delta, it also showed extensive escape of Delta infection-elicited neutralization. This example is consistent with the notion that SARS-CoV-2 evolving in individual immune-compromised hosts, including those with advanced HIV disease, may gain immune escape of vaccines and enhanced escape of Delta immunity, and this has implications for vaccine breakthrough and reinfections.}

This study explores how lesson study (LS) can promote elementary Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers’ professional development (TPD) in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes and beliefs in the maker education (ME) context.
Design/methodology/approach
This is a case study of a LS conducted in China involving four primary school teachers, 20 grade-4 students, and one researcher who also acted as a facilitator. This study adopted an integrated model that combined the unique characteristics of Chinese LS (CLS) with the Dutch LS (LSNL) model.
Findings
This study revealed that LS participation facilitates teachers’ integration of new ME pedagogical practices in their classrooms, while their attitudes and beliefs regarding teaching and learning are increasingly aligned with ME principles. However, challenges such as time constraints, lack of research skills, and insufficient learning resources have also been identified.
Research limitations/implications
This was a small-scale study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
Practical implications
This study expands the use of LS in the ME context by highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing teachers’ PD in terms of new pedagogical practices, attitudes, and beliefs. It also recommends incorporating diverse international LS models to address the limitations associated with localized models of TPD.
Originality/value
The originality of this study lies in its adoption of an integrated LS model to enhance STEM teachers’ PD in an ME context. The findings of this study further strengthen evidence supporting the positive impact of LS on teachers’ PD.}

With their history of working with the socially disadvantaged, NGOs have a unique role in clarifying the nature of demand since social innovation must often address ill-formulated “wicked problems”. Similarly, NGOs can fill the “institutional voids” which limit socioeconomic transactions in the Global South. The paper discusses the wicked nature of visual-impairment, which is both widely prevalent and has biopsychosocial attributes i.e., the functional limitations are reinforced by the psychological perceptions of the blind and visually impaired (BVI), and the sociological stigma of impairment. The empirical setting is India where policies for the BVI population are being formulated within a broader framework of social inclusion. The paper investigates how the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB) has taken advantage of state policies to embrace an academic mandate which includes social innovation. Specifically, it explores IIITB's incubation of the NGO Vision Empower, and the partnership that has followed, to overcome the neglect of the BVI in science and mathematics education.}

abstract = {Background
eHealth is the use of information and communication technologies to enable and improve health and health care services. It is crucial that medical students receive adequate training in eHealth as they will work in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. This trend is especially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it complicates traditional face-to-face medical consultations and highlights the need for innovative approaches in health care.
Objective
This review aims to evaluate the extent and nature of the existing literature on medical student training in eHealth. In detail, it aims to examine what this education consists of, the barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum. This review focuses primarily on some key technologies such as mobile health (mHealth), the internet of things (IoT), telehealth, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Methods
Searches were performed on 4 databases, and articles were selected based on the eligibility criteria. Studies had to be related to the training of medical students in eHealth. The eligibility criteria were studies published since 2014, from a peer-reviewed journal, and written in either English or French. A grid was used to extract and chart data.
Results
The search resulted in 25 articles. The most studied aspect was mHealth. eHealth as a broad concept, the IoT, AI, and programming were least covered. A total of 52% (13/25) of all studies contained an intervention, mostly regarding mHealth, electronic health records, web-based medical resources, and programming. The findings included various barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum.
Conclusions
Trends have emerged regarding the suboptimal present state of eHealth training and barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for optimal training. We recommend that additional studies be conducted on the following themes: barriers, enhancing factors, propositions for optimal training, competencies that medical students should acquire, learning outcomes from eHealth training, and patient care outcomes from this training. Additional studies should be conducted on eHealth and each of its aspects, especially on the IoT, AI, programming, and eHealth as a broad concept. Training in eHealth is critical to medical practice in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. The need for innovative approaches in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlights the relevance of this training.}

abstract = {Background
Gamification has been used successfully to promote various desired health behaviors. Previous studies have used gamification to achieve desired health behaviors or facilitate their learning about health.
Objective
In this scoping review, we aimed to describe digital gamified tools that have been implemented or evaluated across various populations to encourage vaccination, as well as any reported effects of identified tools.
Methods
We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Web of Science Core Collection, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Academic Search Premier, PsycInfo, Global Health, and ERIC for peer-reviewed papers describing digital gamified tools with or without evaluations. We also conducted web searches with Google to identify digital gamified tools lacking associated publications. We consulted 12 experts in the field of gamification and health behavior to identify any papers or tools we might have missed. We extracted data about the target population of the tools, the interventions themselves (eg, type of digital gamified tool platform, type of disease/vaccine, type and design of study), and any effects of evaluated tools, and we synthesized data narratively.
Results
Of 1402 records, we included 28 (2%) peer-reviewed papers and 10 digital gamified tools lacking associated publications. The experts added 1 digital gamified tool that met the inclusion criteria. Our final data set therefore included 28 peer-reviewed papers and 11 digital gamified tools. Of the 28 peer-reviewed papers, 7 (25%) explained the development of the tool, 16 (57%) described evaluation, and 2 (7%) reported both development and evaluation of the tool. The 28 peer-reviewed papers reported on 25 different tools. Of these 25 digital gamified tools, 11 (44%) were web-based tools, 8 (32%) mobile (native mobile or mobile-enabled web) apps, and 6 (24%) virtual reality tools. Overall, tools that were evaluated showed increases in knowledge and intentions to receive vaccines, mixed effects on attitudes, and positive effects on beliefs. We did not observe discernible advantages of one type of digital gamified tool (web based, mobile, virtual reality) over the others. However, a few studies were randomized controlled trials, and publication bias may have led to such positive effects having a higher likelihood of appearing in the peer-reviewed literature.
Conclusions
Digital gamified tools appear to have potential for improving vaccine uptake by fostering positive beliefs and increasing vaccine-related knowledge and intentions. Encouraging comparative studies of different features or different types of digital gamified tools could advance the field by identifying features or types of tools that yield more positive effects across populations and contexts. Further work in this area should seek to inform the implementation of gamification for vaccine acceptance and promote effective health communication, thus yielding meaningful health and social impacts.}

Current empirical studies have mixed results on how ChatGPT impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis explores whether and how ChatGPT impacts student behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. We used the PRISMA method to select, analyze, and report the results. We screened 766 articles from four databases and identified 17 empirical studies with 1735 students for analysis. We compared the effect on student engagement between ChatGPT-based and non-ChatGPT learning. We found a medium effect size on overall student engagement in ChatGPT-based learning in the random effects model. Our analyses further suggest that ChatGPT-based learning is more effective in fostering student behavioral (medium effective size), cognitive (large effective size), and emotional engagement (medium effective size) than non-ChatGPT learning. Our findings revealed ChatGPT is an effective tool for engaging students in learning. We also suggested three roles ChatGPT plays in fostering student engagement: personalized tutoring, programming and technical assistance, and content generation and collaboration. Our systematic literature review revealed potential risks and results in student disengagement, such as over-reliance.}

This study contributes to the empirical literature on students' use of AI chatbots and how they influence learning. The aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. A mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a Mechanical Engineering Master's program at a Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students' grades. Results show that students used ChatGPT for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. While students reported advantages of using ChatGPT, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. Furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from ChatGPT usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. The findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of AI tools. Complex programming assignments remain appropriate in programming education, but pair programming as a didactic approach should be reconsidered in light of the growing use of AI Chatbots.}

This study aims to investigate the learning outcomes, related instruments, and assessment characteristics of these instruments in MOOCs. Learning outcomes that were examined in the studies that were reviewed concerned cognitive, behavioral, and affective learning outcomes. Twenty-five types of assessment approaches were employed to examine these outcomes and to identify the assessment characteristics. The results indicate that a consideration of the assessment of learning outcomes at the beginning of course design could support the formulation of explicit assessment goals and, in this way, instruct learners to work toward learning outcomes. A combination of knowledge tests and skill tasks can be used to examine cognitive outcomes in a particular MOOC. Outcome-oriented feedback rubrics are beneficial to support learner essay performance and interpretations of the utilization of rubrics could better guide providers to give peer feedback. A variety of behavioral and affective outcomes reflect multiple aspects of participant learning in MOOCs, which might contribute to better understanding by teachers and the provision of learning support. Furthermore, assessment tasks throughout the course may differ in difficulty and complexity, which could align with different levels of learner motivation. The findings provide a holistic picture of learning outcomes and related assessment instruments in current MOOCs. Curriculum designers and teachers could benefit from this study to consider appropriate learning outcome variables and instruments to apply in their MOOC practices. Future research might investigate the motivation of learners to participate in a MOOC and how this changes during a MOOC. This could help MOOC designers and teachers to align how learners are motivated, what they want to learn, and what they actually do learn.}

We developed an online educational game designed to enhance core media and information literacy competencies and to help young adults become information literate citizens. We examined the game's effects on skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills, two of the most important MIL competencies. In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game group that played the developed online game, the quiz group that completed a quiz with no game element, and the control group that did not receive any treatment. Before treatment, the participants' perceived levels of intellectual civic skills were measured with a pre-questionnaire. After treatment, skepticism toward online information and information discernment skills as learning outcomes were measured with survey items on skepticism toward online information and an information discernment skills test, respectively. The results showed that the game effectively enhanced the cognitive aspect of media and information literacy (information discernment skills), but not the attitudinal aspect (skepticism toward online information). In addition, the game was found to be effective regardless of the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills, while quiz with no game element was found to be effective only when the participant's perceived level of intellectual civic skills was high. These findings demonstrate the importance of digital game-based intervention as an educational resource. We extend our discussion to the advantages and limitations of games in fostering learners' abilities to evaluate online information.}

However, research has tended to focus upon end products and skill development, and little is known about creative development processes. This study sought to explore young children's creative processes as they engaged with three digital coding devices over an eight-week period as part of a Digital Discovery Program. It employed a microethnography to provide nuanced observations of five young children's (aged 4–5 years) interactions and behaviours. Data was collected through approximately 40 hours of video recordings, capturing the dynamic and multimodal aspects of the childrenʼs play and learning experiences. A multimodal interaction analysis was used to examine the multimodal design affordances of each device as mapped against Murcia et al.'s (2020) A-E of Creativity Framework. The findings revealed a clear interplay between digital technologies and various modes of communication, with children demonstrating creativity through their verbal expressions, manipulation of the devices, and spatial understanding of their physical environment. By understanding the multimodal affordances of digital devices aligned with educational frameworks and embracing child-specific definitions of creativity, educators, curriculum designers, policymakers, and researchers can collectively promote creativity and enrich digital learning and play for young children.}

A class of systems named “enactive” aims to support fluid interaction between technology and people via feedback cycles — the effect of technology on the human agent is fed back by the human action on the technology — based on the use of data sensors. We have extended this concept in a long-term project on socioenactive systems, by emphasizing social aspects in the enactive phenomena. In this article, we investigate how a robot-based experience can promote social behavior among children in an educational context. The study was conducted in workshops with 26 children (4–5 years old), organized in two groups. The system scenario used a narrative based on an adaptation of the Little Red Riding Hood tale to investigate children's interaction in playing embodied-based situations. Data captured from video-recorded workshop sessions were analyzed post hoc using the Grounded Theory methods. In total, 26 interaction coding were identified, with a high interrater reliability assessed by Cohen's Kappa (k = 0.84). Our findings indicate that 50.5% of the children's actions were the result of children-children and group-robot interactions, compared to the 38% of children interacting individually with the robot. This indicates children's high degree of embodied peer collaboration and initiative to accomplish the tasks in the proposed scenario. These results contribute to inform the design and construction of future socioenactive systems.}

Self-determination theory (SDT) can explain student engagement from the needs satisfaction perspective. Therefore, this project aimed to investigate how SDT-based needs support by teachers and student attributes (gender and achievement level) affect AI learning at secondary school level. It adopted a two-study design, with each study using a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design with student needs support from teachers as one factor and one of the student attributes as the other: gender in Study 1 and achievement level in Study 2. In both studies, there were two groups – SDT-based (teacher needs support) and control (without). The analyses revealed that in the SDT-based program, (1) the students had a more positive perception of AI learning and felt that their needs were satisfied, and (2) there were non-significant differences in AI learning between boys and girls and between high and low achievers. The findings suggest that a focus on needs satisfaction could engage boys and girls, and high and low achievers in AI learning. As they become more engaged, they are likely to gain more confidence, feel that the content is more relevant, and become intrinsically motivated to pursue further AI learning.}

Marked advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies throughout industries, including healthcare, necessitate a broader understanding their use. Particularly, intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies and its predictors among nursing students, who are prospective healthcare professionals, is required to promote the utilization of AI.
Objective
This study conducted a path analysis to predict nursing students' intent to use AI-based healthcare technologies based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology.
Design
A cross-sectional survey was performed.
Participants
The participants were 210 nursing students from two nursing schools in Korea.
Methods
This study established hypothetical paths for the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and anxiety on intent to use AI-based technologies. Mediation of positive and negative attitudes and facilitating conditions' direct effects on intent to use were examined.
Results
Positive attitude toward AI (β = 0.485, p = .009) and facilitating conditions (β = 0.117, p = .045) predicted intent to use, whereas the path from negative attitude to intent to use was not significant. Performance expectancy, self-efficacy, and effort expectancy predicted positive attitude. Performance expectancy and self-efficacy had a negative effect on the path to negative attitude, whereas anxiety had a positive effect. Facilitating conditions did not significantly predict positive or negative attitude and only directly predicted intent to use. Social influence did not have a significant effect on intent to use.
Conclusions
Intervention programs and other measures should be developed to provide education and information to boost performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and self-efficacy regarding the use of AI to lower anxiety and foster positive attitude toward AI-based health technologies.}

Nevertheless, their use in SWD research has been limited, with minimal attention given to them. Thus, we created a bibliometric dataset, compared it with other BAs, and developed CNs, SDs, TSs, and a TED for SWD. Furthermore, key term searches (Energy, Solar, Reverse Osmosis, Modeling and Optimization, Membrane Distillation, Environmental, Economics, Fouling, Nanofiltration, and Ultrafiltration) and their literature are discussed. Geographical analysis shows China and the US lead SWD research, shifting from process design to membrane fabrication and solar energy.

The study employed a survey research design, utilizing questionnaires as the primary data collection method. The collected data (n = 149) was analyzed using descriptive statistics (i.e., frequency, percentage, average, and standard deviation (SD). Inferential statistics (i.e., one-way ANOVA) was used to understand the significant differences between the programs of study, gender, and academic level. The findings indicate that the students expressed admiration for the capabilities of ChatGPT and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool for their studies. In addition, the students' motivation towards using ChatGPT was moderate. Furthermore, the study observed significant differences between PD and UXD students and differences based on gender and academic level on certain variables. Notably, UXD students reported that ChatGPT does not understand their questions well, and formulating effective prompts for the tool was more challenging than for PD students. Based on the findings, the study recommends how educators should consider integrating ChatGPT into design education curricula and pedagogical practices. The insights aim to contribute to refining the use of ChatGPT in educational settings and exploring avenues for improving its effectiveness, ultimately advancing the field of AI in design education.}

In the context of various teaching subjects, this raises questions about specific starting points and the actual needs of students, as well as university course offerings. The present study tackles this topic and explores the commonalities and differences between student teachers from three subject clusters: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); language literature arts (LLA); and social sciences (SOCS). The questionnaire-based study examines student teachers' self-assessments of their abilities in terms of digital media, attitudes, and motivational orientations towards the use of digital media in teaching. Group comparisons show that STEM student teachers rate themselves better in competence facets such as technological knowledge, technological content knowledge, and technological pedagogical knowledge, although their attitudes and motivation towards learning with digital media do not differ. Despite the different interrelation effects of investigated influencing factors on motivation depending on subject clusters, the findings suggest the promotion of technological competencies and positive attitudes to increase motivation.}

abstract = {A new school subject, Leaving Certificate Computer Science, was introduced in September 2018 into Irish schools in a period of curriculum reform and change. Drawing on concepts of teacher agency and learner agency, and viewed through a figurational sociology lens, this paper explored the realities of teaching LCCS and the role teacher agency and learner agency played in such enactment. Through a case study design, four teachers were interviewed in a focus group semi-structured manner. To delve deeper into the pedagogical approaches used in LCCS, a further one teacher and their nine students were interviewed. The findings highlight an influential relationship (positive and negative, encouraging and discouraging) between teachers’ agentic decisions in their process of achieving teacher agency and the students process of achieving learner agency. The paper offers a figurational viewpoint of the relationship between teacher agency and learner agency through a constructed Figure. We explicitly argue that the responsibility should not be placed on the teacher and student in achieving agency (as a product) but it is a combination of the teacher and the students and the other interdependent relationships within their figurations, alongside contextual factors, and educational social processes, which determine the fluctuation of the process of achieving teacher and learner agency. The paper provides considerations for computer science teacher education.}

For the purpose of professional development, the paper at hand presents a conceptual framework for predicting the use of technology as a means and as a content of instruction. It is informed by the TPACK framework and the ‘will, skill, tool’ model. The predictors are Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Technological Collaboration Knowledge (TCoK), and Attitudes. These constructs are measured by newly developed self-assessment instruments. Structural equation modeling using a sample of 212 in-service teachers from commercial schools in German-speaking Switzerland lend support to the soundness of the measurement instrument and the conceptual framework. Overall, 36% of the variance of the use of technology as a means and 45% of the variance for the use as the content of instruction can be explained. Mediation and multigroup analyses, a finite-mixture segmentation, comparisons of competing models, and factor score regression yielded evidence for the robustness of the conceptual framework.}

Whether schools have succeeded in vesting students with the needed digital skills important in today's highly digitalized societal landscape however remains unclear. In this paper, we examine whether school resources in terms of ICT infrastructure, use of ICT in education, and availability of technical expertise are pertinent to students' digital skillfulness. We also investigate whether such school ICT resources are unevenly distributed among students of different socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether students of different socioeconomic backgrounds unevenly benefit from these resources. In doing so, we illuminate school ICT resources' role in the process of intergenerational transmission of inequalities. To test our expectations, we employ ICILS 2018 data on 14,183 students in 751 schools across seven OECD countries. Our findings indicate that schools indeed play a meaningful role in nurturing digital skills, namely through students' use of ICT in educational tasks. We also find that students from more advantageous socioeconomic backgrounds more often attend well ICT-resourced schools, pointing at the uneven distribution of school ICT resources in a way that reflects social reproduction processes. Alongside that, the availability of technical expertise in schools seems particularly fruitful for low-SES students' digital skills development. This evinces that schools compensate for limited ICT skills socialization in the family, pointing at social mobility processes.}

Studying the multifractal characteristics of the TBM operational parameters can help identify the patterns, but the relevant research has not yet been explored. This paper proposed a novel classification model for quality grades of surrounding rock in TBM tunnels based on multifractal analysis theory. Initially, the statistical characteristics of eight TBM cycle data with different grades of surrounding rock were explored. Subsequently, the method of calculating and analyzing the multifractal characteristic parameters of the TBM operational data was deduced and summarized. The research results showed that the TBM operational parameters of cutterhead torque, total thrust, advance rate, and cutterhead rotation speed have significant multifractal characteristics. Its multifractal dimension, midpoint slope of the generalized fractal spectrum, and singularity strength range can be used to evaluate the surrounding rock grades of the tunnel. Finally, a novel classification model for the tunnel surrounding rocks based on the multifractal characteristic parameters was proposed using the multiple linear regression method, and the model was verified through four TBM cycle data containing different surrounding rock grades. The results showed that the proposed multifractal-based classification model for tunnel surrounding rocks has high accuracy and applicability. This study not only achieves multifractal feature representation and surrounding rock classification for TBM operational parameters but also holds the potential for adaptive adjustment of TBM operational parameters and automated tunneling applications.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of modern society, extending digital transformation to daily life and psychological evaluation and treatment. However, the development of competencies and literacy in handling digital technology has not kept pace, resulting in a significant disparity among individuals. Existing measurements of digital literacy were developed before widespread information and communications technology device adoption, mainly focusing on one’s perceptions of their proficiency and the utility of device operation. In the contemporary landscape, digital transformation is evolving within specialized domains, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of digital competencies, attitudes, and proficiency in technology application to bridge the digital divide and ensure digital compliance.
Objective
This study was designed to address the shortcomings of existing scales and formulate a digital sensitivity scale tailored to the requirements of today’s society.
Methods
Initial items of the Yongin Severance Digital Sensitivity Scale (YI-DSS) were collected through a literature review, and expert opinions were gathered to ensure content validity. An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis included 986 adult participants evaluating 14 digital literacy items and 6 digital efficacy items. The Cronbach α confirmed internal consistency reliability, and 2-tailed t tests, ANOVAs, and post hoc tests analyzed demographic differences in digital literacy and efficacy.
Results
A robust 4-factor digital literacy solution was identified: digital application, digital communication, critical thinking, and digital ethics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.891; Bartlett × 2=9829.713; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.782-0.947). A 2-factor solution defined digital efficacy: digital confidence and digital anxiety (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.735; Bartlett × 2=3282.217; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.787-0.912). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for each model (digital literacy model: χ271=676.0, comparative fit index=0.938, Tucker-Lewis index=0.921, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.093; digital efficacy model: χ28=81.9, comparative fit index=0.977, Tucker-Lewis index=0.958, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.097), which indicated a good fit. The YI-DSS also showed high correlation with the previously developed Digital Literacy Scale (r=0.809; P<.001).
Conclusions
The YI-DSS, as a self-assessment tool, has the potential to bridge the generational information gap by promoting acceptance, motivation, and adaptation to digital technology. Furthermore, given the remote nature of digital therapeutics, an individual’s familiarity with required technologies and digital communication strongly influences their acceptance of digital treatments and the efficacy thereof. This scale can play a pivotal role in enhancing compliance with digital therapeutics by preemptively assessing individuals’ technological literacy and competency.}

The results show that student cognitive strategies impact student perception and engagement with technology and learning tasks, with AR positively impacting student academic self-efficacy in higher education. Interestingly, neither the learning space nor the students' perception of task value was shown to impact their intention to use AR. Instead, it was the characteristics of the technology itself which encouraged adoption. The study's findings reinforce the need to (1) teach and facilitate effective cognitive strategies among third level students and (2) identify and overcome negative cognitive strategies that harm student self-efficacy and engagement.}

We asked 32 participants to assign colour properties (hue and brightness) and emotional categories (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) to stimuli of varying amplitude and angular frequency. We found that perceptions of pleasure and arousal increased with amplitude and angular frequency, but negative and relaxing emotional states were not able to convey. We also found associations between vibrotactile stimuli and colour properties. High amplitude stimuli were linked to warm colours and darker shades, while low amplitude was associated with brighter shades and greater variance in hue. We finish by discussing the causal mechanisms of crossmodal correspondences and contribute a design space for creating multisensory experiences.}

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.}

To address this gap, our study aims to construct the AI-Assisted L2 Learning Attitude Scale for Chinese College Students (AL2AS-CCS) and evaluate its reliability, validity, and relationship with L2 proficiency. Our research comprises two phases, each involving separate samples. In Phase One (Sample 1: n = 379), we conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factor structure of the AL2AS-CCS. The resulting two-factor structure consists of 12 items, categorized into cognitive and behavioral components. In Phase Two (Sample 2: n = 429), we performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the factor structure and assess model fit. CFA in Sample 2 confirmed the factor structure and demonstrated a good model fit. Additionally, the AL2AS-CCS exhibited high criterion validity, internal consistency, and cross-gender invariance. Our findings suggest that the AL2AS-CCS is a valid measurement tool for assessing Chinese college students' attitude toward AI-assisted L2 learning. Moreover, Chinese college students were discovered to maintain a moderately positive attitude toward AI-assisted L2 learning. Additionally, a positive correlation was identified between this attitude and their L2 proficiency.}

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review on technology-enhanced support for children with Down Syndrome and young people who match the mental age of children considered neurotypical (NT). The main aim is threefold: to (1) explore the field of digital technologies designed to support children with Down Syndrome, (2) identify technology types, contexts of use, profiles of individuals with Down Syndrome, methodological approaches, and the effectiveness of such supports, and (3) draw out opportunities for future research in this specific area. A systematic literature review was conducted on five search engines resulting in a set of 703 articles, which were screened and filtered in a systematic way until they were narrowed to a corpus of 65 articles for further analysis. The synthesis identify several key findings: (1) there is diversity of technology supports available for children with Down Syndrome targeting individual capabilities, (2) overlapping definitions of technology makes it difficult to place technology supports in individual categories rather than subsets of a broader term, (3) the average sample size remained small for participants in the studies, making it difficult to draw solid conclusions on the effectiveness of the related interventions, (4) the distribution of papers indicates that this is an emerging area of research and is starting to build body of knowledge, and (5) there are limited studies on newer emerging technologies which requires further investigation to explore their potential.}

Although previous reviews have examined the impact of PAs on learning and learning-related outcomes, it still remains unclear what specific design features, social cues, and other contextual elements of PA implementation can optimize the learning process. These questions are even more prevalent with regards to the K-12 population, as most reviews to date have largely focused on post-secondary learners. To address this gap in the literature, we systematically review empirical studies around the design of PAs for K-12 learners. After reviewing 1374 studies for potential inclusion, we analyzed 44 studies that met our inclusion criteria using Heidig and Clarebout's (2011) frameworks. Our findings showed that learners had preferences for specific types of PAs. While these preferences were not always associated with increased learning outcomes, there is a lack of research specifically investigating the intersection of perceptions and learning. Our results also showed that pedagogical strategies that are effective for human teachers were effective when used by PAs. We highlight what specific design features instructional designers can use to design PAs for K-12 learners and discuss promising research directions based on the extant work in the field.}

abstract = {Purpose
Considering the role of community outreach of a Higher Education Institution (HEI) in promoting sustainable regional development, based on the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda, the present study aims to verify, with the usage of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool, the alignment of community outreach actions of an HEI to the SDGs and identify its actions with the greatest impact.
Design/methodology/approach
The study is descriptive through a case study at a university in Brazil. Documentary analysis was carried out using data on more than 15,000 community outreach projects developed from 2009 to 2022, using natural language processing (NLP). In addition to the descriptive aspects, combining NLP with statistical techniques allowed us to discuss the alignment between community outreach projects and the SDGs from a longitudinal perspective.
Findings
The results demonstrated that the main SDGs in community outreach actions are SDG 17: Partnerships and Means of Implementation; SDG 4: Quality Education; SDG 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production and SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. These results are prominent because community outreach aims to establish a dialogical relationship between society and the university, conceiving the exchange of knowledge based on the actions developed and sharing knowledge with those involved in community extension.
Originality
The use of AI technologies to identify and monitor data on community outreach actions in HEI towards the SDGs, and to propose ways to share this information with internal and external stakeholders of the institution.}

This fact made us think about the reason for this inequality. We attempted to answer such questions by means of a survey filled out by 138 students of STEM university degrees. Thanks to this survey, we have been able to understand the motivations and opinions of the students of STEM degrees regarding gender perspective. Our study highlights the possible influence of computer and video game use on enrollment in STEM degrees. Furthermore, it points out the differences between men and women in computer science skills before they start their studies. The answers provided by the surveyed women showed a correlation between women who play video games and those who get better grades. In addition, women who play video games feel more integrated into STEM degrees. Finally, differences were found in gender perspective between the male and female participants.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The convergence of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases in South Africa is challenging to health systems. In this analysis, we assessed the multimorbidity health needs of individuals and communities in rural KwaZulu-Natal and established a framework to quantify met and unmet health needs for individuals living with infectious and non-communicable diseases.
Methods
We analysed data collected between May 25, 2018, and March 13, 2020, from participants of a large, community-based, cross-sectional multimorbidity survey (Vukuzazi) that offered community-based HIV, hypertension, and diabetes screening to all residents aged 15 years or older in a surveillance area in the uMkhanyakude district in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data from the Vukuzazi survey were linked with data from demographic and health surveillance surveys with a unique identifier common to both studies. Questionnaires were used to assess the diagnosed health conditions, treatment history, general health, and sociodemographic characteristics of an individual. For each condition (ie, HIV, hypertension, and diabetes), individuals were defined as having no health needs (absence of condition), met health needs (condition that is well controlled), or one or more unmet health needs (including diagnosis, engagement in care, or treatment optimisation). We analysed met and unmet health needs for individual and combined conditions and investigated their geospatial distribution.
Findings
Of 18 041 participants who completed the survey (12 229 [67·8%] were female and 5812 [32·2%] were male), 9898 (54·9%) had at least one of the three chronic diseases measured. 4942 (49·9%) of these 9898 individuals had at least one unmet health need (1802 [18·2%] of 9898 needed treatment optimisation, 1282 [13·0%] needed engagement in care, and 1858 [18·8%] needed a diagnosis). Unmet health needs varied by disease; 1617 (93·1%) of 1737 people who screened positive for diabetes, 2681 (58·2%) of 4603 people who screened positive for hypertension, and 1321 (21·7%) of 6096 people who screened positive for HIV had unmet health needs. Geospatially, met health needs for HIV were widely distributed and unmet health needs for all three conditions had specific sites of concentration; all three conditions had an overlapping geographical pattern for the need for diagnosis.
Interpretation
Although people living with HIV predominantly have a well controlled condition, there is a high burden of unmet health needs for people living with hypertension and diabetes. In South Africa, adapting current, widely available HIV care services to integrate non-communicable disease care is of high priority.

Nowadays, car wash facilities give numerous car wash or car detailing services such as foam washing, waxing, and polishing, which are handy for consumers. However, there are certain limits revealed that customers must queue up for a long period till their turn. During busy hours, clients could have to wait for a few hours, which wastes customers’ time. Besides, it is problematic for people living in apartments because there is no place for them to wash their cars. Other than that, most individuals are frightened to leave their homes because worried about the COVID-19 virus.

This study investigates the nuanced relationship between generative AI use and university students' self-efficacy and technological dependence, illuminating the underlying paradoxes and implications for inclusive education practices. Through a survey of 348 university students, with 200 valid responses analyzed, we uncover the direct and indirect impacts of generative AI usage frequency on AI dependence. Our findings reveal a paradoxical effect: enhanced AI usage significantly amplifies students' confidence and efficiency in learning, yet simultaneously intensifies their dependence on AI. This dual impact both supports and complicates the incorporation of AI technologies into educational settings, underscoring the need for a balanced approach to leveraging AI in teaching and learning. Our study underscores the critical importance of a nuanced understanding of AI's role in education. It highlights the necessity of crafting an educational landscape where technology augments learning processes without compromising independent learning capabilities. By navigating the complex interplay between technological advancement and educational inclusivity, our findings guide the development of AI-assisted learning environments that are not only effective but also equitable and accessible.}

abstract = {Proficiency in higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) is essential for 21st-century students to effectively address complex challenges. Assessing HOTS can increase students’ awareness of their cognitive abilities and promote the development of advanced cognitive skills. This study proposes an automated assessment approach for HOTS, to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on experts and are often short-term. The exceptional knowledge base and advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted academics to extend their application to various areas, where they outperform models limited to specific domains. Inspired by this, we propose a framework for the automated assessment of HOTS using LLMs, called LLM4HA. The framework consists of two distinct models: a text-based exercise classification model constructed from pre-trained BERT, and a student HOTS assessment model based on response data, constructed by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. To validate the performance of our framework, we established a classification rule based on Bloom’s taxonomy for exercise classification. We collected 43,070 exercise data points from 181 undergraduate students, from which exercise text data and response data were obtained. The results demonstrate that LLM4HA successfully classifies exercises and assesses students’ HOTS. The BERT-based classification model outperforms ChatGPT-4, and the LLMs-based fine-tuning model significantly outperforms the RNNs-based model. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify the causes of this outcome. The findings indicate that the robust knowledge base and sophisticated architecture may be crucial for achieving optimal performance in the HOTS assessment task. The implementations are available at https://github.com/xxiongGG/LLM4HA-mian-0302.}

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are a useful summarization tool for helping students remember the main ideas and central claims of a lecture. However, due to limitations in current techniques, they are unable to deal with lecture’s complex structures, which contain multiple knowledge themes. To address this issue, we proposed an original theme-based lecture summary (TLS) system that combines graph-based theme segmentation algorithms and LLMs, consisting of data preparation, theme segmentation, summary generation, and consistency evaluation stages. To assess the effectiveness of the system, an education intervention was implemented using a mixed-methods research design. Forty-six undergraduate students took part in an authentic lecture context for eight weeks. The quantitative study used a 2 × 2 factorial design, with intervention conditions including lecture type (conceptual vs. procedural) and TLS-generated summaries (with vs. without). Then, eight of the participants were chosen for a focus-group interview to learn about student satisfaction. The study finds that: 1) TLS-generated summaries have a significant positive influence on knowledge recall; 2) lecture type has no effect on the intervention outcomes of TLS-generated summaries, regardless of whether it is conceptually or procedurally oriented; and 3) TLS-generated summaries can increase student satisfaction. The current study broadens the use of LLMs in authentic educational settings to promote student success.}

abstract = {How critical thinking is understood has a logical impact on pedagogy and curriculum design in a critical thinking education. If critical thinking is seen as a complex mix of knowledge, skills and dispositions that can be articulated and made an object of study in themselves, then there is scope for intentional and explicit targeting of such things. If, however, critical thinking is seen as a general skill more or less impermeable to pedagogical influence and best realised through the development of content knowledge, then an explicit focus on developing thinking skills is misplaced and potentially distracting. The latter view is that of cognitive load theory (CLT), a theoretical framing of thinking and learning that has gained traction in education including with practitioners. This paper will explore some of the assumptions of CLT and show that they are either (1) in error, (2) vaguely or confusingly expressed and/or (3) the conclusions drawn within the theory are often errors of inference. Moreover, I point out that important educational research that weakens the claims of CLT is often not engaged with or addressed.}

While teacher support is crucial for learning, little is known about how it influences students' attitudes and flow experience across different achievement groups in programming education. This study examined the interrelationships among perceived teacher support, students' attitudes, and flow experience in programming learning across different achievement levels. Data were collected through surveys from 549 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Students were categorised into three groups based on their programming achievement levels: above-average, average, and below-average. A multi-group mediation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between variables. The above-average group showed significantly more positive perceptions across all variables than other groups. Students’ attitudes mediated the relationship between perceived teacher support and flow experience differently across achievement groups. The findings highlight the importance of differentiated teacher support strategies across achievement tiers and suggest that fostering positive attitudes towards programming is crucial for all achievement levels, particularly through enhancing the perceived usefulness of programming.}

In this qualitative case study, over a period of 16 weeks, video data were collected during making activities in an advanced placement science course with 19 pupils aged 12–16 years, and interviews were conducted. We combined thematic and interaction analyses of empirical data and identified three themes: 1) engagement and spontaneous concepts, 2) programming and making physical objects, and 3) subject integration. Our conceptual framework for the analyses integrated two features of the Vygotskian sociocultural theory of learning: concept development as a dialectical process of scientific and everyday concepts and the “tool and symbol” duality. Our findings show that both top-down and bottom-up approaches to integrating school subjects into a makerspace were effective but underused. We illustrate this by mapping pupils' shared understanding in a sociotechnical space, visualized as a process of “rising to the concrete”, which may require teacher's scaffolding at different levels of abstraction and use of instructional materials in different modalities.}

This allows accurate data analysis and completion of scientific research on data obtained at geologically different places. This study used 4 lithologies datasets with high dimensionality and multiclass imbalance problems for analysis and classification. The imbalance of data classification is one of the most important problems facing current data analysis. Data imbalance can considerably influence classification performance, especially when dealing with other difficulty variables such as the presence of overlapping class distributions. This impact is especially obvious in multi-class conditions when mutual imbalance relations across classes complicate matters even further. Moreover, the problem of high dimensionality can lead to increased computing complexity and overfitting, and thus these issues can affect classification performance. To overcome these problems, we developed a new hybrid deep learning multi-class imbalanced learning method that combines Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) to resample the data, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most useful predictive features. Finally, we believe that our developments can help improve geology research by providing accurate classification and rapid answers about interpreting data obtained in various study areas.}

Method: This study advances the application of evidence-centered design (ECD) in developing an effective heat stress training program for construction and general workers. The methodology encompasses comprehensive steps, including: (1) defining training objectives, (2) determining relevant knowledge domains, (3) designing assessments, (4) providing evidence of training effectiveness, and (5) developing practical tasks using real-world case studies. The training’s effectiveness was evaluated through an experimental training session in which 311 construction and general workers participated. The efficiency of the training was measured by calculating short-term, middle-term, and long-term knowledge gains about heat-related illnesses. Results: Statistical analysis revealed significant improvements in workers’ understanding of heat stress concepts, risk factor identification, prevention strategies, symptom and sign recognition, and first aid application from the short-term to the middle-term and into the long-term. Trainees’ feedback also affirmed the training’s effectiveness in enhancing awareness and preparing them to implement preventive measures against heat stress. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that a heat stress training program utilizing ECD significantly enhances the efficiency of heat stress awareness. These assessments effectively evaluate construction workers’ ability to recognize and respond to heat-related hazards. Practical applications: This finding contributes to the theoretical knowledge of construction worker safety and provides a practical framework for guiding the design of training assessments. The study addresses a gap in literature regarding the assessment of training effectiveness, offering insights for iterative improvement of safety training in construction industry.}

Using digital story writing (DSW) in the classroom is an effective inquiry-based pedagogical approach to address literacy development by improving language and technological abilities across disciplines. This study recruited 82 primary students in Hong Kong to attend a three-month DSW journey to learn AI and completed a knowledge test at the end of the program. Among the students, 16 best-achieving students were further invited to participate in artefact-based interviews, and we further analysed their work to understand how they formulate AI understandings. It is found that the participating students were able to propose an authentic scenario, apply their new knowledge of AI and think up meaningful AI-driven solutions in their digital stories. Furthermore, we examined students' DSW process in terms of inquiry-based pedagogical cycle (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion) to demonstrate how they learn AI. Overall, DSW as an inquiry could effectively foster students' AI literacy in using and applying AI knowledge to solve real-life problems, far beyond merely knowing and understanding related concepts. We suggest that using DSW as a pedagogy has the potential to support students to scaffold students’ AI understanding, particularly for young children.}

Given the challenges of conducting large long-term studies of child-robot interaction (CRI), little is known about the impact of CRI on children’s socio-emotional development. Here we summarize the literature on predictions and expectations of teachers, parents, therapists, and children regarding the effects of CRI on children’s socio-emotional functioning and skill building. We then highlight the limited body of empirical research examining how CRI affects children’s social behavior and emotional expression, and we provide a summary of available questionnaires for measuring socio-emotional constructs relevant to CRI. We conclude with design recommendations for research studies aimed at better understanding the effects of CRI, before social robots become ubiquitous. This review is relevant to researchers, educators, roboticists, and clinicians interested in designing and using social robots with developmental populations.}

abstract = {Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has generated excitement and concern in education. While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates. This review provides valuable insights for researchers, instructors, and policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of generative AI integration in educational practice.}

abstract = {This chapter addresses the importance of critical and creative media education across the curriculum from the primary years of learning onwards. The reading and writing skills associated with print literacy are insufficient for meaningful social participation in the digital age. Digital media production and creative media arts, in this instance through film, drama and animation production, are seen as central dimensions of a wider and more relevant conceptualization of literacy. School curricula and expressive practices must evolve to accommodate intermedial communicative modes, digital meaning-making and the complex media and moving image landscapes in which most children and young people in developed countries are immersed.}

abstract = {Programming plays a pivotal role in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. However, programming concepts and syntax are extremely abstract. We developed an augmented reality (AR)-based learning system to make programming concepts tangible. Specifically, we adopted a high interactive AR mode that allows students to freely assemble puzzle cards to compare various 3D animated programming results. This study adopted a quasi-experimental design and recruited 98 fifth graders as participants. Three groups, named the high interactive AR, low interactive AR, and the traditional learning (control) groups, were formed. The results revealed that the AR-based instruction, especially the high interactive AR mode, helped the students improve their programming achievements, gain higher learning motivation, reduce their cognitive load, and acquire a high degree of technology acceptance. The interview data mainly showed that the students in the high interactive group attained more positive experiences of assembling puzzle cards to learn programming. Our study suggests that using AR technology alone did not facilitate learning motivation, although it did produce better programming achievements compared to the traditional learning. A high interactive design such as “puzzle cards” is vital for arousing higher motivation, which can in turn facilitate a more in-depth understanding of programming logic.}

abstract = {It is an undeniable fact that Design Thinking (DT) and Reflective Thinking (RT) skills are among the qualities that must be possessed by every individual, especially teachers, who are one of the most important pillars in achieving the goals of curriculums, in the world of education where digital technology has become a great power. This makes it necessary to carry out studies to develop teacher training programs in this direction. The purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of DT training on the DT and RT tendencies of pre-service teachers and to elicit the opinions of pre-service teachers on this process. The study group consisted of a total of 44 s-year pre-service teachers, 32 female and 12 male, attending the Department of Primary Teaching in a state university. The study employed an embedded design, one of the mixed methods, and qualitative research was embedded within quantitative research. An quasi-experimental method was used in the quantitative dimension of the study, and the case study design was used in the qualitative dimension. In the experimental dimension the study, data were collected by using the “Design Thinking Scale”, “Reflective Thinking Level Determination Scale” and a “Personal Information Form” developed by the researcher. The qualitative data of the study were collected by using a semi-structured interview form prepared by the researcher. At the end of the study, it is believed that online DT instruction may have an impact on pre-service teachers' both DT and RT tendencies, and that pre-service teachers with low reflection and critical reflection tendencies may have benefited more from online DT instruction compared to those with higher tendencies.}

abstract = {The study introduces exemplary explicit teaching strategies as enacted by a middle school STEAM teacher. Through a 10-lesson climate change STEAM program, data were collected to explore explicit teaching strategies using O-TOP (Oregon Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparation [OCEPT] Teaching Observation Protocol) and NGSS 8 Practices (Next Generation Science Standards). Data from teacher interviews and class observations were also used to identify and describe how this STEAM teacher offered students opportunities to solve real problems in their community. Examples demonstrating three stages of STEAM education: understanding context presentation, performing creative design, and experiencing emotional touch are provided. We argue STEAM programs should be presented with more realistic issues arising from the community students belong to and that explicit teaching strategies should give students the opportunity to achieve core competencies and scientific literacy. Our study offers implications about the need for systemic teacher training and professional development for STEAM education.}

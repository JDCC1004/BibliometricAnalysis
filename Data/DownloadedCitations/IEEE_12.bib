  abstract={This WIP exposes the design and implementation of Midroid, an open mobile platform focused on microcontrollers' education. The platform has been designed with the aim to address both the problems detected as the educational gaps associated to the acquisition of the algorithmic thinking needed in the conceptualization and structuring of a program or algorithm determined. To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms. Thereby, the educational concept of the platform takes into account the challenges related to the mobility of technology, learning and the learner. As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing. Furthermore, the CT allows the use of computers or tools such as mobile devices or both computational and mathematical programs as way to resolve the formulated problems in a knowledge area. These aspects were needed in the design and implementation of the platform in the areas of hardware and software respectively. It is expected with this research, the design and implementation of a mobile platform related to microcontrollers; area which addresses the problems mentioned and also enhances the learning process in the students. The educational and technical validation of the platform will be developed through qualitative study between different groups of students in the subjects of the curriculum concerning the microcontrollers' area, thus, validating the impact of the platform.},

  abstract={A pod of ten unattended “behind-the-glass” computer kiosks has been running at the Raglan Road Multipurpose Centre in Grahamstown for more than three years. The goal is to enhance computational thinking skills, and to provide logic, mathematical, reading and computer literacy skills via edutainment and fun. The technology is explicitly engineered so that usage is not dependent on having willing teachers as supervisors. Initially targeted at 7-13 year old children, we've had to make adaptations for younger children from the on-site pre-primary school. We describe the innovative mechanism that allows unattended access while securing and protecting our systems. We give a brief overview of the technology and content on the kiosks, the implementation, and some observations about usage. Unusually, the project was conceived and initiated from a technical perspective, and we discuss some issues that have arisen around maintenance and division of responsibilities between the parties involved.},

  abstract={Effective application of contextual learning can be facilitated by providing opportunity to students to use the knowledge in concept learnt, to solve certain problems within a `context'. To improve student engagement in quantitative based course like Math, Accounting or Science; it is of supreme importance that students are able to make connections between knowledge and its application to a real world context. Two such cases of Contextual Learning have been presented in this paper which was modeled in implementation of interdisciplinary projects across Accounting and IT disciplines, with Business students enrolled in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting courses and CIS students in Mobile Application course and ICT. This study aims at presenting a contextual strategy used to enhance Accounting and IT skills in Undergraduate students at Dubai Women's College, Higher Colleges of Technology. We posited that through this contextualized approach, students would see Accounting, Computational thinking and app development as tools for solving work-related problems. Using Constructivist teaching and REACT (relating, experience, application, collaboration and transfer) strategy; we initiated curriculum integration of both Accounting and IT, which deviates from traditional teaching model where learning of a subjects is isolated from any context. We conclude that the interdisciplinary projects implemented were a robust technique for application of contextual learning. The most important outcome was achieving the highest level in bloom's taxonomy and that is to `create'.},

  abstract={Microsoft's Kodu is a visual programming environment for children inspired by robotics rule-based formalism to specify behaviors. The reactive nature of this approach means that systems just react to what they are currently sensing, they do not need to have a perfect model of the world, and they can easily respond to external changes in the world. This resilience makes behavior-based systems perfect for real world robotics use. When developers chose this approach for Kodu, the hope was that this resilience would help minimize the potential frustration of young users. This paper introduces the Kodu developers' strategy, results and future plans in developing a user-friendly programming environment that successfully introduces children in a fun and easy way to the fundamental concepts of computer science and computational thinking.},

  abstract={Accelerated by the Do-It-Yourself mindset of the Web 2.0 culture, end-user programming, which is programming by end users with limited, if any, formal programming background, is growing rapidly. Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end users. More recent approaches include visual programming with drag-and-drop style of programming making it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Future Trace, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to visualize discrepancies between the programs users intended to write and the actual programs.},

  abstract={Logic Programming allows for the exploration and development of Computational Thinking skills. Those being abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and generalisation, among others, which are fundamental for problem-solving. What is more, Logic Programming helps building up Logical Thinking skills, also distinguishing valid arguments from fallacies and contradictions, as well as establishing connections between arguments through reasoning, to name some. These practices are not only essential for the development of knowledge in STEM, but also in Computer Science disciplines. Recently, arguments have been standing in favour of the early integration of programming within compulsory education. The international scientific community is looking forward to researching and initiatives being deployed towards this direction. This article introduces Metagame -Metajuego-, a methodological proposal which integrates key aspects to facilitate the effective integration of Logic Programming in primary education through collaborative and gamifying strategies. Furthermore, concrete cases of games are presented which have been formulated thanks to applying the proposed methodological approach to different educational contexts. The narratives upon which these games are based, incorporate learning cores presented in the curricular school designs where they were implemented.},

The digital has been used as a tool of communication along with language. Therefore, we would need to have ability to express our idea and understand an other's presentation with language and digital, which is just computational Literacy. However, most educators focus on using computer and internet, not computational literacy. Therefore, we define the operational definition about computational literacy suited for the present age by analyzing existing computational Literacy. In addition, we extract educational factors from the relation with computational thinking that is the purpose of computational literacy. Finally, we discuss teaching-learning strategy of computational literacy for all level s of students.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the impact of children's programming fluency and its relationship to the structure of the programming code, aiming to determine the best age to start teaching programming. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative assessments with qualitative observations to assess children's development of computational skills. The study focused on block coding, particularly using the Scratch programming language to enhance children's program-ming fluency. The findings reveal that block coding significantly improves programming fluency, especially for children between 10 and 15, highlighting the importance of code structure in helping young learners better understand programming concepts such as encapsulation. This study emphasizes the value of early programming education and offers insights into effective teaching methods to promote computational thinking and creativity in young learners.},

  pages={163-168},
  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is a crucial 21st-century skill, and its integration into K–12 education underscores the need for effective assessment tools. Although there are existing tools to measure CT practices, improvements can be made in terms of their assessment formats and data analysis methods. To address this gap, this study develops Critters Puzzle (CP), a game-based assessment tool aimed at measuring primary school students’ CT practices, specifically abstraction skills. Based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, 12 progressively challenging tasks were developed. To ensure the content validity of the tool, validation was put forward involving expert review and students’ cognitive interviews. Twenty-two experts were invited to review the appropriateness of the measurement and seven students (aged 6–10) were invited for interviews to evaluate the usability of the platform and its effectiveness as an assessment tool. Results indicated that the game is engaging, understandable, and appropriately challenging for students, and several modifications were made to the game based on the feedback from experts and interviewees. Future research will involve empirical studies to validate the game's psychometric properties, including its reliability and validity, as an assessment tool for CT practices.},

  pages={313-314},
  abstract={When the classical theory of problem solving is put into practice, a sequence of operator applications must be found that transforms an initial problem state into a goal state. This is equivalent to finding a path through the graph of possible problem states from an initial node to a goal node. The search is usually conducted by an algorithm or by a human through an iterative process of selecting and applying operators to states found so far. Here, I demonstrate examples of searching in problem spaces via interactive drawing. The demonstrations help to elucidate issues in the design of new problem-solving affordances that may enhance the abilities of human solvers to understand and solve problems. This opens up new ways to conceptualize the process of solving problems, and it suggests new ways to teach a form of computational thinking.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper presents the development and use of empathy interviews at Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) which is the fifth largest school district in the state. At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.},

  abstract={Teachers living and working in rural areas in the United States often lack access to high-quality professional development (PD) opportunities. As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.},

The comparability and the further mapping relationships between CTLS and multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) were discussed at great length within the theoretical viewpoints of computational thinking. Whereafter a container terminal logistics computational architecture was put forward for scheduling and execution using the perspective of MPSoC, which was established on the conceptual framework and fundamental principles of distributed, parallel, and cooperative computing in essence. Finally, the approach was demonstrated by investigating the stress testing, load balancing and process behavior of a typical container terminal logistics service case in contrast with the previous work based on the comprehensive computational experiments.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, the teaching of coding and computational thinking has become increasingly important in the school environment. If before they were a secondary part of the teaching program and provided only, at best, from the age of eleven and up, it is now clear that they should play a relevant role in the school curriculum as soon as possible. In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period. This work therefore aims to choose some of the tools available, designed for different needs but sufficiently similar in order to allow the development of a fluid and continuous coding educational path, gradually adding new complexities, starting from the age of three in the school of childhood, up to high school.},

  abstract={Software engineering is defined as a discipline concerned with all aspects of software production from inception to the maintenance of a system. It has often been dubbed as the "cradle-to-grave" approach to producing reliable, cost-efficient software delivered in a timely manner that satisfies the customer's needs. It interleaves the concepts of individual work with team work and the soft skills of technical writing with technical proficiency. Therefore, as computer science educators, we are faced with the challenge of creating a learning experience for our students that effectively introduces the technical aspect of software engineering principles, as well as those essential non-technical skills. The goal of this paper is to describe a work in progress that focuses on creating an enhanced learning experience where computational thinking, collaborative learning, and service-learning are infused into an undergraduate software engineering course. The paper introduces these concepts and how each is used to train students.},

  pages={1-2},
  abstract={A key strategy for bringing computer science (CS) education to all students is the integration of computational thinking (CT) into core curriculum in elementary school. But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All.},

  abstract={Sound recognition refers to the technology or process of identifying and classifying different sounds or audio signals. This study aims to develop a sound recognition system using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to classify and identify the gender of catfish based on their speech patterns. The study explores a range of supervised ML and DL algorithms, such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, to predict the gender of catfish. The extracted features from the audio signals of the catfish serve as inputs to these algorithms, which produce binary predictions classifying the catfish samples as either male or female. This study further explores data analysis of the audio signals from the male and female catfish. The automated sound recognition system proves to be a more efficient and accurate approach compared to traditional methods, which rely on time-consuming visual observations. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, and more, were employed to gauge the effectiveness of the algorithms in predicting the gender of catfish based on speech patterns. Among the employed algorithms, ANN and NB demonstrate the highest accuracy, achieving a score of 89.47%.},

  abstract={Health care is the improvement of health through the avoidance and cure of diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a substantial health issue, ranking as the eighth leading cause of death and the tenth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years for both genders. This research aims to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately predict the presence of CKD, which affects people worldwide. Timely identification of CKD is crucial to prevent it from progressing to its final and most critical phase. Machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, are used in this study for the prediction of CKD. Various health parameters such as age, albumin level, and more are used as input into each ML algorithm to predict the presence of CKD. Data preprocessing is carried out to improve the quality of the data for more accurate prediction. The data is analyzed to uncover the connections between CKD health parameters and their impact on the occurrence of CKD. This research further examines the influence of different train and test data ratios on the accuracy of the employed algorithms. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and more are employed to gauge the effectiveness of each algorithm in making predictions. Random Forest stood out as the most accurate algorithm, with a score of 96.25%. Naive Bayes and XGBoost demonstrated the highest sensitivity, achieving a perfect score of 100%.},

  abstract={This study demonstrates the utilization of Machine Learning (ML) for network slice prediction, enabling the optimization of resources for diverse network slices. Traditional methods for network slice prediction often lack efficiency and result in inaccuracies. By leveraging ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, an intelligent framework that automates network slice prediction is developed. This framework enhances network virtualization and management, facilitating resource allocation. The ML algorithms take real-time network conditions and usages, such as packet delay and smart city, as input and output for selecting the most suitable network slice. Data analysis is further conducted to reveal the connections between the input parameters and how these parameters influence the selection of the accurate network slice. Network slicing plays a crucial role as it enables the customization of services and facilitates efficient scaling to meet the specific needs of different applications and industries. The accuracy scores of the employed ML algorithms were generally perfect, except for the KNN and SVM classifiers, which achieved an accuracy of 94.30% and 92.16%, respectively, for the prediction of network slices based on incoming network connections and usages.},

  abstract={In a world where algorithms are ubiquitous, the development of computational thinking competencies is becoming progressively important among students, technology professionals, and 21st-century citizens in general. Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.},

  abstract={The researcher sought to synthesize data from studies on robotics programming experiences for children in the age bracket zero to eight, as well as for pre- and in-service early childhood educators, to identify possible contributions that robotics programming may make to teaching and learning of STEM (sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects. The investigation was initiated with inclusion of research articles as a result of search and assessment processes. All of these studies were selected such that they had the application of educational robotics in common. The synthesis of preliminary findings, study subjects, and potential advantages of educational robots in STEM education, especially in engineering and technology are discussed and dealt with in great detail. Additionally, the implications of educational robotics and robotics programming for educational institutions, curricular materials, and pedagogical techniques are incisively addressed. This review revealed that employing robots to teach computer programming may be a promising teaching tool for early childhood STEM education.},

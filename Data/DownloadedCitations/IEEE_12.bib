  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pilot test framed in educational robotics where parents and child work together during the same session. In recent years, an educational movement has emerged that is related to the introduction of computational thinking, programming, and robotics in schools. Educational robotics is presented as one more resource that serves as a support in the different curricular subjects and facilitates the emergence of skills such as socialization, creative spirit and personal initiative, allowing participants to find answers to the problems that may arise in their reality. It is for this reason that a pilot test was carried out where we included the participants' parents in a session. To do this we used the Crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. This platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. From the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people. At the end of the experience, the assistants completed the assembly of their own robot. The article contains a study of the state of the art of using educational robotics. It also includes an analysis of the different tools mostly used in educational robotics. Also, throughout the article the learning methodology used, the different educational resources and the results obtained from the experience are described.},

  abstract={With limited time in the school day to meet required state-level objectives across subjects, it is challenging to meet the need to address declining physical activity levels and to incorporate additional computer science instruction in elementary schools. Project moveSMART uses a web-based platform to integrate opportunities for physical education with computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) learning activities. Fourth grade students who underwent a single-day intervention experienced a significant improvement in their interest in coding and their perceptions of coders. This paper presents a series of three new lessons in the fifth grade moveSMART curriculum that allow students to create and improve a physical activity monitor. We employ a project-based learning approach to expose students to data analysis and machine learning in the framework of classification and pattern recognition.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we report on CS Pathways, a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA. The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students’ culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All. This paper advocates for the need for culturally-responsive computing, describes how it is integrated into teachers’ instruction, and presents the CS Pathways curriculum design.},

  pages={323-330},
  abstract={In this work, we aim to improve code writing skill in Python-based introductory programming courses for first-year university students. In such courses, students as novice programmers would benefit from personalised and formative feedback to: 1) quickly identify issues in their computational thinking process or coding techniques, and 2) know how to proceed when facing a certain problem. Due to the large number of students, it is impractical for instructors to manually assess all the work of each student to provide tailored feedback. We design and implement Automatic Programming Coach (AP-Coach), a web-based tool for automatically generating formative feedback for exercises on basic programming concepts. AP-Coach combines software engineering techniques (code similarity measures based on abstract syntax trees, and unit testing), and AI techniques (machine translation) in a novel manner to provide relevant feedback. We report promising results for AP-Coach in the following aspects: 1) quantitative evaluation of code similarity computation and machine translation, 2) qualitative evaluation of the perceived quality and usability of auto-generated feedback, and 3) experience of a selected group of computing students using the system.},

  abstract={As computational thinking (CT) emerges as a required skill in the modern educational and professional landscape, the use of games for learning programming has gained prominence. However, consideration for the user's needs and experiences is as important as the educational content itself, in order to ensure that the learner has an engaging experience. For this reason, this paper explores the integration of Empathic Design principles into the user experience (UX) evaluation of several popular programming genre games aimed at cultivating CT. The findings indicate a partial positive alignment with these principles, particularly in user-centric design, learning journey, and visual aspects. Learner-players feedback emphasized engaging experiences and visual appeal, while improvement suggestions centered on enhancing interface depth, providing clearer instructions, and addressing challenges for beginners and scalability issues.},

  pages={01-09},
  abstract={The goal of this research full paper is to provide insight into most recent findings of interviews with faculty members teaching digital skills in an integrated and innovative way embedded into courses on subject didactics of a teacher education program. Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future.},

  abstract={This document presents a systematic review of Visual Programming Tools for the Arduino Board. The Arduino board is an embedded platform that focus on enabling an easy way to teach embedded systems, but, due to its success, it ended up being used in different teaching levels, ranging from primary to university. The board was also applied in the teaching of robotics and other contexts since it is relatively cheap, easy to program and its community has produced a considerable amount of free educational material. Even though Arduino is a success it is still maturing in terms of educational purposes, aside the electronic knowledge that needs to be explored, the board is programmed, by default, with c++, which is considered not friendly to Computer Thinking beginners. Trying to solve this problem, many solutions apply Visual Programming, which is proven to make it easy for unexperienced and even children to learn the basis of Computational Thinking, in the educational context with Arduino. Even though there are many solutions applying visual programming for Arduino, there are no systematic review or survey on this subject, meaning that it is hard to identify where are the gaps and which are the problems that are already solved. Therefore, on this paper, it was performed a systematic review on the subject, the method found 372 papers, which 31 were selected for full review. The reviewed solutions where discussed and categorized, we expect that the presented results could be used as guideline for new research in the area and by educators and companies that are looking for visual programming tools for the Arduino board.},

It is possible to stimulate problem- solving through computer programming teaching with ER. However, as far as we know, there are no methodologies for teaching programming with ER focusing on CT development in High School that went through scientific validation of the proposal. This study is an Educational Design Research that aims to introduce a methodological framework for teaching programming in High School with ER (named CTProgER) and validate two instances of the framework. It was considered consolidated teaching methodologies with ER, combined with the Anthropological Theory of Didactics and evidence from our ER studies. As a result, we present the CTProgER Framework guideline, two instances of the CTProgER Framework, and these instances’ validation through the Delphi method.},

  abstract={Undergraduate software engineering courses typically require students to work on team-based projects that reinforce disciplinary content and soft skills. At the same time, these students, particularly those at liberal arts institutions, are required to take courses that focus on civic issues, including on racial and ethnic inequality. Often, students perceive these courses to be outside their disciplinary areas, and may not comprehend how these topics are applicable to computer science and software engineering. This paper reports on the experience of Pulimood and Leigey as they and their students grappled with issues of racial injustice in the criminal justice system, and drew upon their own disciplinary backgrounds to apply computational thinking and software engineering principles to help the community better understand these issues and advocate for reform. The paper also describes the experience of teaching courses from different disciplines in a collaborative model, working closely with a local community partner to support its work on an identified social issue, and the learning outcomes, as well as the benefits and challenges of this approach. Recommendations and future directions are also discussed.},

  abstract={Today, teaching faces several challenges, including students’ difficulty in understanding abstract concepts and lack of motivation. To address these problems, the use of virtual reality (VR) has been explored as an innovative and potentially effective educational tool. However, so far, the effectiveness of VR applications and the perception of their use lack a clear and effective approach to be used to support education. The importance of addressing this problem lies in the need to improve the quality of teaching using emerging technologies. It is for this reason that it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of teaching using VR. In this context, this research presents the results of the FreeDev application, previously validated with 20 teachers and with 80 engineering students from a private university. FreeDev is a VR application designed to support the teaching of basic programming, it is aimed as an educational tool to provide an immersive experience to students on how to get started in programming and computational thinking. FreeDev has been well accepted, and both teachers and engineering students see it as a tool that can be used to support education. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of education.},

  pages={1829-1842},
  abstract={Cloud adoption in industrial sectors, such as process, manufacturing, health care, and finance, is steadily rising, but as it grows, the risk of targeted cyberattacks has increased. Hence, effectively defending against such attacks necessitates skilled cybersecurity professionals. Traditional human-based cyber-physical education is resource intensive and faces challenges in keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies. This research focuses on the main advantages of incorporating large language models into cyber-physical education. The ChatGPT platform serves as an online tool to educate students on fundamentals, cyberattacks, and defense concepts, fostering the development of a new generation cybersecurity experts. The proposed learning approach adheres to the ChatGPT-assisted learn–apply–create model. Responding to prompts provided by the learners, the learning phase engages in conceptual learning, the applying phase involves mathematical modeling of various cyberattacks, and the creating phase develops MATLAB program to incorporate attacks into sensor measurements for the experiment and entails developing the necessary attack detection approaches. The effectiveness of the detection method developed by ChatGPT is assessed in both the simulation and real-time scenarios using a J-type thermocouple. The impact of the proposed learning platform over traditional learning methods is evaluated through an extensive comparative feedback analysis on the learner's foundational concepts, computational thinking, programming efficacy, and motivation. The study proved that integrating ChatGPT into engineering education enables students to swiftly learn cyber-physical fundamentals, comprehend and model cyberattacks, create new attack signatures, and contribute to developing detection algorithms. Such integration provides the learners with essential industrial skills crucial in modern industries.},

  abstract={This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors.},

  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={2},
  pages={266-281},
  abstract={Contribution: This research illuminates information entropy’s efficacy as a pivotal educational tool in programming, enabling the precise quantification of algorithmic complexity and student abstraction levels for solving P problems. This approach can provide students quantitative, comparative insights into the differences between optimal and student implemented solution, and allowing educators to offer targeted feedback, thereby optimizing the learning and abstraction processes in algorithm design through deliberate practice. Background: Abstraction is considered one of the most impor11 tant skills in problem solving. Many studies in programming have shown that higher abstraction capability can significantly simplify problems, reduce program complexity and improve efficiency. However, it is difficult to develop criteria to measure the level of abstraction, and there is still a lack of relevant systematic research. Research Questions: 1) How can students’ abstraction ability in programming be effectively measured? 2) How to develop programming education and training methods based on the measurement of abstraction ability? Methodology: Forty-six grade 10 students participated in the experiment, divided into two groups for programming train23 ing using information-entropy-based assessment and traditional learning methods. Their level of computational thinking, algo25 rithmic efficiency improvements, and test scores were used to measure performance and to analyze the effectiveness of the training methods. Findings: Through empirical research, this article finds that information-entropy-based assessment can reflect the differences in problem solving among students possessing varying capa31 bilities. Information entropy can be crucial for evaluating and improving students’ abstraction performance and algorithm efficiency.},

Three design objectives are addressed: representation of people, user experience, and facilitation of knowledge discovery. The paper is organized to demonstrate a customizable workflow for the process of formulating design based on data visualization principles, implementing designs with open-source tools, and incorporating user evaluation in service to successfully fulfilling the design objectives and related functionality in the final implemented design. Examples of hidden knowledge recovered using the visualizations are presented, providing new insights into Maryland’s antebellum Black population. The data visualization design methods and practices permitted investigation at a more granular level, and enabled communication of a richer narrative. Use of open-source software makes these methods accessible to archivists, information professionals, and researchers, and supports creation of artifacts for research, teaching and learning. Future extensions could incorporate advanced computational techniques to enable map features, network and textual analysis, and dynamic query-based composition of visualizations.},

  abstract={This paper offers a short summary and critical review of the forthcoming book "AI-Driven Research Intelligence: Integrating 3C Theory from Foundational Abilities to Advanced Research Thinking". The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has transformed scientific research, prompting the need for theories on human-AI collaboration. This book introduces the 3C Theory, which integrates AI with human cognition, emotion, and research thinking (critical thinking, creative thinking, and computational thinking). Within the 3C theoretical model, AI not only as a research tool but as an enhancer of human cognitive abilities, emotional regulation, and research thinking. By comparing 3C Theory with existing models, the book highlights its potential to transform research processes and support the design of intelligent Human-AI research systems. Additionally, this paper explores the prospects of intelligent research system design, proposing new avenues for research innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration and Human-AI interaction.},

  abstract={In the last decade, educational reforms introduced technologies and digital tools to a higher degree, serving as powerful catalysts in educational innovation for creating, managing, and delivering content in STEM education with a focus on computational and engineering subjects. However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect.},

This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to investigate the 32 studies that were published between 2021 and 2024 in order to assess the impact of LLMs on problem solving skills. The review identifies the significant improvements in undergraduates' problem-solving effectiveness, creativity, and computational thinking. It also emphasizes the need for careful implementation of these tools to avoid potential overreliance, which may impact the student's ability to develop independent problem-solving skills. The review identifies the importance of a well-balanced integration of LLMs in education to maximize their benefits while addressing the challenges they present. Recommendations for future research directions are suggested to further explore the long-term impacts of LLMs on the development of problem-solving skills and their applicability across diverse academic environments.},

In order to be able to develop those skills in their students, the teachers themselves need to possess them. This paper focuses on female future lower primary school teachers who, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, took an online course on algorithmization and programming, having little or no prior knowledge and skills. The completion rate depended not only on the students' motivation and willingness to learn, but mainly on the content and structure of the course, which was completely modified and made into an online course. The results were more than surprising. The students were able to complete the activities included in the course. Moreover, those activities inspired them to create their own activities, which they may be able to use in their future classes.},

Following the methodology provided by Kitchenham, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive overview of studies, research, and practices related to robotics education in higher education. The study focuses on identifying the most commonly used RE hardware-based platforms in academic research publications, the type of knowledge intended to be imparted, and the skills or competencies reinforced by the platforms. Within the findings we can underline that there is no exclusive platform, but rather commercial ones are used, made by the researchers themselves, and even adapted from robots that were not designed for instructional purposes. Moreover, the subjects intended to be taught were all related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and oriented to electrical engineering, electronics, robotics, and computer science professions. On the other hand, the skills that improved the most were computational thinking, cooperation and sophisticated problem solving, which are essential for 21st century job descriptions.},

The implementation of these activities in the classroom requires not only the knowledge and skills of informatics and biology, but also the collaboration of teachers of both subjects. These activities are implemented in phases, starting in biology lesson and continuing in informatics lesson. The first activity tests the level of sensitivity of people to colour differences. The second activity trains human adaptation to psychological stress. The third activity is focused on creation of compensatory aid that compensates for colour perception disorder. The design and programming of students’ STEAM applications is a meaningful way to use informatics in problem solving. Using and experimenting with these applications helps students to better understand the biological content. STEAM approach strengthens students’ orientation towards interdisciplinary studies (e.g. bioinformatics) at the higher education level and helps them to be more employable in the labour market.},

  abstract={The construction industry is a new avenue for big data and data science with sensors and cyber-physical systems deployed in the field. Construction students need to develop computational thinking skills to help make sense of this data, but existing data science environments designed with textual programming languages create a significant barrier to entry. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octave, an end-user programming environment designed to help non-expert programmers analyze spatiotemporal data (e.g., as gathered by a GPS sensor) in an interactive graphical user interface. To aid exploration and understanding, Octave's design incorporates a high degree of liveness, highlighting the interconnection between data, computation, and visualization. We share the underlying design principles behind Octave and details about the system design and implementation. To evaluate Octave, we conducted a usability study with students studying construction. The results show that non-programmer construction students were able to learn Octave easily and were able to effectively use it to solve domain-specific problems from construction education. The participants appreciated Octave's liveness and felt they could easily connect it to real-life problems in their field. Our work informs the design of future accessible end-user programming environments for data analysis targeting non-experts.},

  abstract={There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have "turned-off" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, "all politics are local," and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups.},

The method known to be effective for producing lifelong learners and improve cognitive skills, has been experimented on several facades. Problems, being major drivers in the process, have been researched to design and the deliberate the most effective ways. Through this paper we propose a game based learning model which can be used as problems in a problem based learning framework. In contrast to learning activities supplied using more old-fashioned didactic methodologies, this strategy can be used to engage a student through meaningful activities. This paper presents a model to use game in problem based learning followed by a case study and its analysis. Giglane game was used in the process to analyze the effectiveness with respect to number of stakeholders and incidents reported. The method is validated for effectiveness and promises to be an effective strategy for reflections and self-directed learning attributes. The method directly supports the decomposition structure from the computational thinking methodology which can be combined with the problem based learning process.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This research paper describes the mathematics teacher knowledge transformation when computer science concepts are integrated with mathematics. During the last decade, schools and educators made a significant effort to introduce Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12. While this effort produced some positive results in schools where resources and specialized educators are available, there are school districts where creating new classes and/or hiring specialized teachers is not a sustainable option. This creates a need for teachers that are specialized in one subject area to expand their knowledge into CS and CT, and teach these concepts in their classes. This knowledge expansion and integration should result in creating integrated curricula using their subject matter knowledge and the newly acquired CS knowledge. This implies that the teacher should be able to identify the intersection of concepts between the two fields, and leverage their difference and similarities to promote deep learning for their students. The current study explores how the teacher candidates' technological, pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in mathematics is affected when mathematical concepts are integrated with CS and CT. This study is a three-day intervention in a graduate level secondary mathematics education methods course, where utilizing Math + CS integrated modules we infuse CS concepts into mathematics. The already known mathematics context reduced the cognitive load for familiarizing the teacher candidates with CS, and the integration of the CS concepts provided a different perspective for thinking about mathematics and teaching. After having the teacher candidates reflecting on the concepts of Variable and Equal Sign (=), our results showed that they started noticing the differences and nuances between the two fields, developing this way their interdisciplinary Math + CS TPACK (I-TPACK) knowledge. Furthermore, the study showed that representing multiplications using repetition structures illuminated the internal mechanic of multiplication and its properties. Finally, the experience with the strict grammar and syntax rules of programming illuminated the areas in the teacher candidates mathematics instruction that were ambiguous in the way they teach variables, equations, percentages, and multiplication.},

  abstract={This research full paper presents a systematic review exploring methods and pedagogical strategies utilized for digitally including adult education students through computer-assisted collaborative activities. Youth and adult education faces significant disparities along the globe, with low enrollment rates in many countries as highlighted in the UNESCO's $5^{th}$ Global Report. Whenever we consider the $4^{th}$ United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal for 2030, education aims for inclusion and lifelong learning opportunities. With the aim of investigating the literature about existing computer-assisted collaborative methods and strategies for digital inclusion of youth and adults, we conduct a systematic literature review on the theme. Findings reveal a scarcity of works tailored to adult education, especially in developing nations, even with the inclusion of Brazilian and South African knowledge repositories to broaden the scope. Collaboration emerges as a prevalent strategy, often alongside other methodologies. Notably, mobile devices are widely utilized due to their accessibility, and social networks and virtual learning environments play significant roles. However, the integration of computational thinking and artificial intelligence for digital inclusion is still in its infancy. Overall, digitally including adult learners is crucial for fostering inclusive education and enhancing opportunities for marginalized populations.},

  abstract={High schools and undergraduate courses present several problems regarding teaching programming. In this perspective, several factors have led to the development of tools to support programming disciplines, including: (i) the persistent problems in teaching programming worldwide, (ii) the inclusion of computational thinking and programming practices in the new Basic Education Curriculum in Brazil, (iii) the need for a lightweight virtual tool that can be freely shared and used, as many available tools charge fees, and (iv) the practical application of knowledge by licentiate degree students in Computer Science, encompassing both learning theories and software development, through the evaluation of the tool. This research aims to develop and evaluate a lightweight web tool through a case study in the context of supporting feedback for programming activities in Brazilian higher education. Additionally, the study investigates whether the feedback is considered the main problem for first-year students in computer courses from the perspective of licentiate computer science students and whether their participation in the case study can improve their skills and abilities in analyzing educational tools. A total of 16 students and three professors from four disciplines participated in the case study, with an online questionnaire as the main instrument for data collection. The analysis was performed considering the collected responses' quantitative and qualitative aspects. We obtained quantitative responses through a Likert scale, while qualitative aspects were analyzed using the Discourse Unveiling Method (UDUM). Positive aspects were identified for both professors and students, providing initial evidence of the tool's potential. Moreover, the study highlighted important feedback from undergraduate Computer Science students, which provides an opportunity to apply their knowledge technically.},

However, in reality, not many learners will acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of current situation implies that programming ability of learners cannot be measured by tests that require knowledge. This paper focuses on not only the knowledge items required for programming but also the programming thinking (computational thinking), which is the ability to combine the constituent elements of the program. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the learner’s understanding from the learner’s process to solve the code puzzles that require programming thinking as well as knowledge. We developed the interface to realize the proposed method. The experimental result with the interface showed that the proposed method could estimate with the accuracy of 80% or more.},

These opportunities have become increasingly present across contexts and have expanded the possibilities for introducing and sustaining student participation in computing. However, while these experiences tend to be effective ways for engaging new participants and new forms of participation, we must be careful to not overlook how ’high-stakes’ these experiences might be for learners. To explore this tension, this paper describes two case studies of students engaging in coding and computational thinking with Minecraft Education Edition. The first case study involves a 7-year-old Black and Latina girl who experiences significant frustration when her computer program destroys significant portions of her project. The second is from a Latino boy who avoids using the coding capabilities in Minecraft EDU out of fear that the code might not work properly. Building on these case studies, this paper suggests that the field take steps to ensure that the language and actions associated with low-stakes and high-stakes are reflective of learner perceptions, and that we design learning experiences that appropriately reflect this nuance.},

  abstract={A problem based learning pedagogy has paved its pathway into teaching and learning standing as one of the effective contributors in the teaching and learning process. With the varying institutional philosophies, the methodology has ample scope for improvements when it comes to its design and delivery. This paper proposes a method of using abstraction from computational thinking to construct knowledge in problem based learning process. Arriving at principles is one of the major objectives of learning process and also contributes towards the self-directed learning. A paper piece activity with shapes and sizes is designed to create free and themed scenarios and further analyzed with various attributes and its contribution towards the knowledge construction process. The paper presents a model and discusses the various perspectives of the activity. The method is found to be an effective approach to design problems that contribute to holistic learning. Knowledge construction process can aid into an effective learning method.},

  pages={192-196},
  abstract={The Coding for Liberal Arts project explores the integration of coding into humanities education to develop both digital and disciplinary skills in primary school learners. The project addresses the need to transcend the traditional approach that confines coding to STEM area, overlooking its potential to enhance critical thinking and cross-disciplinary competencies in the liberal arts. The main objective of this research is to investigate how educational robotic can be used as an interdisciplinary teaching tool in subjects such as Italian, History and Geography, promoting technical skills alongside a critical understanding of academic content. The methodology is based on principles of Media Education, Cooperative Learning, Competence-Based Learning and Experiential Learning, and it follows the phases of the Scientific Method. Preliminary findings suggest that students have acquired basic coding skills and demonstrated the ability to apply them in disciplinary contexts, though further practice is needed for more complex applications. The research underscores computational thinking's transformative potential as a bridge between technical expertise and critical thinking in the humanities, illustrating that its integration into liberal arts not only boosts digital competencies but also supports cognitive development, providing a comprehensive approach to modern education.},

  abstract={Computer Science 1 (CS1) courses introduce undergraduate students to computational thinking and their first programming language. As in most institutions, CS1 is a challenge for students at the University of Brasilia, one of the top 10 universities in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian higher education system changed with an affirmative-action policy to admit more students from the public K-12 system: the “Quota” Law was implemented at all federal public universities. This paper aims to answer two research questions: 1) What knowledge about the positive/negative impact of certain features on the success of a CS1 course can be discovered from mining educational data augmented by social-economic information? 2) Are these features different between quota and non-quota students? The analysis uses social-economic and academic performance data of undergraduate students from 2012 to 2019. Data mining algorithms such as generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, and random forest were applied to the data. The findings include: (1) the relevance of indicators such as the consumption rate of university-subsidized meals, (2) that gender is not a determining factor in failure/success, and (3) a higher failure rate for quota students in the Computer Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering majors.},

This research aims to analyze the use of software development methods. Using the Publish or Perish and Mendeley tools, the identification of several papers shows that the Agile methodology, especially Scrum, still dominates current software development practices because of its flexibility. There is a trend of combining Agile with approaches such as APLE and SME. The methodology has also spread to the educational field with BYOS to teach software engineering concepts and human-computer interaction with Agile to teach computational thinking. Formal methods are used to guarantee product quality. These findings provide a comprehensive overview of the current state and trends in software development methodology adoption across various research domains.},

  abstract={This paper explores the evolving landscape of training for archival professionals in the context of big data and emerging technologies. By comparing two educational frameworks—the CAS framework, developed from computational thinking research and CAS research papers, and the InterPARES framework, based on empirical studies with archivists working with AI/ML, we identify areas of alignment and divergence. While both frameworks share significant concordance, suggesting a growing consensus on integrating computing into archival work, key differences in their approaches (learning outcomes vs. competencies) and focus areas (such as work practices, systems thinking, and cybersecurity) highlight the need for further discourse among archival scholars, educators, and practitioners. These distinctions must be addressed before formalizing CAS educational frameworks. This paper also initiates efforts to integrate emerging technological competencies by bridging the CAS and InterPARES frameworks, emphasizing the value of complementary perspectives from both professional practice and academic research. We argue that such integration is essential for developing robust competency frameworks in archival education, particularly within higher education's professional programs.},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly prevalent in various domains, its integration into education offers unique opportunities to enhance learning experiences. This paper explores the application of AI, specifically machine learning, in biology education through the classification of edible and poisonous mushrooms. Leveraging a dataset of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families, this study demonstrates how AI techniques can be used to classify species based on morphological features such as cap shape, gill attachment, and color. The use of AI not only improves students' understanding of species identification and biological classification but also introduces them to key concepts in data science, such as feature selection, model training, and validation. By implementing machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, students can engage in interactive learning experiences that merge biology with modern technological tools. The results show that integrating AI into biology curricula can foster both scientific literacy and computational thinking, offering a more comprehensive and engaging approach to science education. This paper outlines a practical framework for educators to incorporate AI in biology lessons, preparing students for future academic and career challenges in an increasingly digital world.},

  abstract={The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is contemporary teaching method, applicable within STEM framework, and consists of a series of steps that students – as future engineers – follow, in order to design a prototype artifact and find a solution to a complex engineering problem. These steps usually include problem – solving processes, such as defining the problem, background research, specifying requirements, brainstorming, evaluating, choosing the best solution, developing a prototype, testing the prototype and finally communicating the research results. During the process, students engage themselves with all Computational Thinking (CT) dimensions. In this research, we apply EDP, within the STEM and CT Epistemology framework, in order to design and develop an open – hardware, open – source, low – cost, easy and safe to use, drown, for educational activities, in Higher education. The purpose of this work is to highly engage University students, in developing solutions for complex Mechatronic course - related problems, and evaluate how they achieved their learning objectives. We also design a use case scenario, in which students form proper engineering teams to work with the design of the UAV, to program its behavior and to understand avionics. The simple design, safe use, economic cost, and open philosophy of this drone make it suitable not only for university courses, but also for educational robotics applications, and in STEM education in general, regardless of the educational level.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper describes a novel twofold approach to analyze the data collected during a six-week research-based summer professional development workshop for middle and high school STEM teachers in Southwest Missouri. In the fast-evolving field of Computer Science (CS), particularly within the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, the demand for a skilled workforce is increasing. To meet this demand, it is crucial to provide K-12 students with education in computing, computational thinking, and other broader Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The existing STEM curriculum could be enhanced to develop skills such as research-based problem-solving more effectively, aiming for a more comprehensive skill set among students. Therefore, empowering STEM teachers with a solid foundation of research-based problem-solving skills can significantly boost their readiness for the classroom, thus enriching their students' educational experiences. The Research Opportunity for Smart Environments (ROSE) program, a three-year initiative funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), aims to prepare middle and high school STEM teachers to effectively introduce CS concepts through innovative IoT applications in Smart Environments, including Smart Homes and Smart Classrooms. To support STEM education in rural and other underrepresented areas, a cohort of in-service teachers from rural Southwest Missouri was selected for the inaugural ROSE summer workshop. Our data collection approach included open-ended questions and effective formative assessment techniques to gather the teachers' perspectives during the initial summer session. We adopted a twofold data analysis strategy, using the qualitative coding tool MAXQDA and sentiment analysis tools Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) and TextBlob, to analyze the teachers' responses. The research questions explored the impact of the ROSE program on educators and how their experiences and outlooks influenced their engagement and professional development within the program. The findings indicate that the ROSE program has positively influenced the teachers' personal and professional growth. The teachers experienced increased confidence and knowledge in research and teaching CS concepts, despite facing various challenges, which acted as motivation for learning. Their reflections also indicated that the mentorship and resources provided by the ROSE program have promoted the development of innovative teaching methods and a shift towards a student-centered approach, showcasing the program's success in fostering the personal and professional development of teachers for the advancement of future CS and STEM professionals.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice of a Full Paper presents new ways of teaching classes. The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline "Algorithms and Data Structures I" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.},

To properly address the lack of structured materials in secondary schools, an Educational Design Research (EDR) project was developed to introduce young students to STEM, and particularly to electronics field. For this purpose, the developed approach combines instructionism and constructionism methods, through three educational projects and “Drops of knowledge” modules. The developed material was applied to 9th and 12th grades of a secondary school, with the achieved results showing that this immersive approach effectively provides students with the necessary competencies to tackle the initial technological challenges of electronics.

  abstract={In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role.},

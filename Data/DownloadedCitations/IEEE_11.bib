  abstract={This innovative practice WIP paper describes an effort to introduce future teachers, who are primarily Hispanic and planning to be PK-8 teachers, to computational thinking for teacher preparation at a Hispanic Serving Institution located on the U.S.-Mexico border. An interdisciplinary team of education and computer science faculty is implementing efforts to increase pre-college student engagement in computational thinking (CT) along with increased equity, particularly for Hispanic and women. One aspect of these efforts is the modification of an existing CT course that will eventually be required for all teacher preparation students. The first pilot of this CT course was conducted in the fall 2023 and included quality pedagogical approaches to teach CT content to primarily Hispanic pre-service elementary teachers.},

The lessons were intended to support students' computational thinking while learning mathematics. To do so, we used the educational design research (EDR) methodology to develop the lessons. We collaborated with mathematics teachers and practitioners to improve the lessons. We also piloted the lessons for a few junior high school students in Indonesia. We collected data from online discussions with teachers and practitioners, GeoGebra files, and screen video recordings. We found that collaboration with teachers and practitioners helped us to refine the lessons. The pilot study showed the engagement of students in programming and debugging.

It consists of 3 stages and each stage will focus on students of certain ages. The first stage corresponds to the grades from 1st grade to 2nd grade of primary school. The bases of computational thinking will be developed through dynamics and games, in this way children will not get bored and learn by playing. The second stage is aimed at students from 3rd grade to 6th grade. It consists in introducing the basic concepts of the computation and the use of Scratch once the computational thinking was developed when they were smaller. Finally, in the third stage the programming languages will be taught. This stage is developed throughout high school and will start with the Python language to finish with C ++.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Work-In-Progress paper elucidates the approach of the NSF-funded CAHSI INCLUDES Alliance for creating change in students' competencies by an effort across eight institutions to support the delivery of one-and two-credit hour courses for three levels of problem solving in Computer Science: general problem solving, computational thinking in problem solving, and algorithmic thinking in problem solving. The courses were developed to address industry's need for improved problem-solving skills, incorporating consistent, deep collaboration with Google technical staff The first of its kind for CAHSI, the problem-solving courses are fewer credit hours than typical courses in order to fit within a traditional curriculum. The intent is to instill complementary problem-solving, computational thinking skills, and logical reasoning needed to succeed in computer science, and make this content available across different student populations at various stages in their academic pathways. Advanced problem solving prepares students for competitive interviews. The courses create opportunities to learn across academic levels, and create new student communities, mentorship opportunities, and social connections to support retention. The paper reports on the course design, student reflection, assessment and evaluation, and an ethnographic study of the courses.},

In this study we propose the conceptual model of Cooperative Thinking, a new education construct of team-based computational problem solving. Cooperative Thinking is not only the sum of Computational Thinking and Agile Values, rather it is a new overarching competence suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems. We suggest to tackle the Cooperative Thinking construct as an education goal, to train new generations of software developers to Pareto-optimize both their individual and teaming performances.},

Computational thinking has been increasingly encouraged, not only for those who wish to become computer scientists, but also to develop other important skills that are used to solve problems, using a combination of critical thinking and fundamentals of computing. The research used was qualitative of the phenomenological type. In the analysis, the teachers involved concluded that to solve a problem, even if it is Ecology, it is not necessary to use a computer to process the algorithm to find the solution, a student can create an algorithm and process it and find the answer.},

  abstract={Computer science is becoming ever increasingly important to our society. Computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. A few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school.},

  abstract={We detail the design, implementation, and an initial evaluation of a virtual reality education and entertainment (edutainment) application called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). VEnvI is an application in which students learn computer science concepts through the process of choreographing movement for a virtual character using a fun and intuitive interface. In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students (16) participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within VEnvI facilitated students' edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. Results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence. Students also showed increased interest and excitement regarding the computing field at the end of their summer camp experience using VEnvI.},

  title={Teaching Structured Authoring and DITA Through Rhetorical and Computational Thinking}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={58},
  number={3},
  pages={328-343},
  abstract={Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.},

  abstract={Several instruments have been used for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities. In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT.},

In this paper we present an investigation of the psychometric factors that determine the success in this contest, e.g. Abilities in Computational Thinking or intelligence factors. For this purpose, we looked for subsets of Bebras questions that are requiring joint psychometric constructs, according to the responses of the test persons, applying latent trait analysis on all combinations of questions. After identifying suitable sets of questions, we tested the fit of the mono-parametric Rasch Model and evaluated the distribution of person parameters. Additionally, the identified sets of questions were analyzed by qualitative methods to find out the nature of these common psychometric constructs. As a test bed for feasibility studies, we have chosen the Bebras Contests of Germany 2009. We have found and analyzed several sets of questions that met our requirements, analyzed the questions, and identified differences in the performance of boys and girls in these sets.},

Our objective is to design and implement a process to engage stakeholders from multiple sectors and identify the computational tools and problem-solving skills and define how these skills-directly informed by industry needs-can be integrated across disciplinary curricula. By explicitly integrating computing concepts and disciplinary problem solving, engineering graduates will enter the workforce with improved and practice-ready computational thinking that will enhance their problem-solving and design skills. We present the analysis of the computational skills and the strategies that we are using to map the workforce problem-solving requirements onto the foundational computer science principles. We outline the framework that we are using to identify opportunities for curricular integration between computer science concepts and the disciplinary engineering curricula. By documenting, evaluating, and making the process explicit, this process can serve as a model for national efforts to strengthen undergraduate computing education in engineering.},

  abstract={In this paper we describe our process for synthesizing frameworks for recognizing student talents in the areas of Computational Thinking (CT) and Engineering Design (ED) from prior research. Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents.},

  abstract={Some researchers consider that the benefits of Computational Thinking (CT) in education are unclear, and therefore a quantitative study to understand the effects of CT skills in the basic levels of formal education is needed. The present study aims to analyze the effects of CT on the academic performance of students in high school. We seek to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) Can CT increase the problem-solving skills of students in high school? (RQ2) Is CT related to the performance of students in high school? (RQ3) Can CT improve the performance of students in high school? We conducted an analysis between two groups of students with similar profiles belonging to the same population, where the factor CT proficiency is the only feature that distinguishes both groups. The results show that there is a moderate correlation between the performance of evaluated students and their skills of CT developed by computer programming. In addition, we found that students proficient in computer programming have superior performance up to 10.2% in ENEM (National Exam of High School) assessment compared to those with little or no experience level and even better performance 21% in the WASI test problem-solving in students on attending high school.},

  abstract={This research full paper characterizes the literature on academic initiatives to foster computational thinking and programming (CT&P) in Brazilian K-12 education. Context: Mapping and analyzing the diversity of experiences and studies that address CT&P in K-12 education can bring valuable data to researchers. This work delimits such study to the Brazilian scenario to allow a more in-depth view, given the Brazilian context. Previous surveys and systematic mapping studies present recent publications in major Brazilian computing journals and conferences. Although they offer important contributions, they do not comprehensively cover the Brazilian literature on CT&P in K-12 education, since they focus the search in the Brazilian Computer Society publications alone. Objective: This work proposes to characterize the literature on CT&P in K-12 education in Brazil. Results: through a systematic mapping study, we collected information on year, venue, type, K-12 education stage and modality, methodological contexts, and used tools and programming languages from 338 selected primary studies from 2001 until 2016. Conclusions: there is a significant increase in the number of Brazilian studies in the latest years, showing a growing interest on this research area as well as several trends and gaps to be addressed by both researchers and practitioners.},

  abstract={The study explores the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students’ English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students’ CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students take part in the experiment, of whom 28 are assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 are assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. Results indicate that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in English-language achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; and 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produces a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge, their learning anxieties are also lower than those of the control group. The analysis of behavioral patterns also reveals that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrate better language-learning interaction, whereas the students playing character-ER board game present greater CT development in finding solutions.},

CT involves problem-solving skills based on Computer Science concepts. However, there is no CT formal definition as well as information on how to integrate it with other high school subjects. Studies are still searching for methods, tools, and instruments to evaluate CT skills to allow effective adoption. Problem-solving is critical to mathematics, and introducing robotics in this context can favor the learning process. The goal of this study is to apply educational robotics in a Brazilian public high school and evaluate the impact on the development of CT skills and mathematical performance. Two research questions guide the study: (RQ1) Can the use of robotics favor the development of CT skills? (RQ2) Can the use of robotics favor math learning? The development of CT skills was evaluated through the Bebras Challenge, and the annual performance obtained by the students in mathematics was considered to evaluate the impact on mathematics. The overall results pointed out that the use of robotics can favor the learning of mathematics and they bring some indications that the use of robot kits can stimulate the development of CT skills, but still more research is needed.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper examines the Bebras Challenge tasks, a Computational Thinking (CT) contest that does not require programming knowledge. Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.},

  abstract={This paper explores a survey instrument on Computational Thinking (CT) and attitudes towards Computing for educational purposes. Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2,290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context.},

  abstract={In the past, many investigations focused on the impact of programming skills towards learning computational thinking (CT). However, not all schools or instructor are able to implement or deliver programming curriculum at the K-12 level. For novice programming, CT activities may help students to learn and appreciate problem-solving and programming capabilities. In this paper, an investigation to study the effectiveness and suitability of an unplugged CT activities has been carried out. This is part of the unplugged CT framework development process, where the first element investigated is the type of suitable activities. Two iterations were conducted to confirm the suitability of the activities. The activities were also verified with a selected group of secondary school teachers. The results have shown that unplugged activities can be effective in helping students to learn programming capability. The next step of the research is to identify other relevant components relevant to the framework for an unplugged CT activities for novice programmer.},

  abstract={Automatic grading systems help lessen the load of manual grading. Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student com-petency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so. Additionally, survey responses from course teachers support the importance of our work.},

  abstract={The scientific and reasonable evaluation indicators that can fully reflect the various dimensions of students' computational thinking (CT) skills is the basis and premise of accurately evaluating students' CT skills, which is of great significance to the cultivation of students' CT skills. However, the current research on how to construct the evaluation indicators is still inadequate, and most of the research is put forward by the subjective experience of researchers, lacking objectivity and the universality of ability. In the paper, we comprehensively reviewed the concepts of CT in the theoretical literature of CT, aiming to construct the comprehensive and effective evaluation indicators of CT for students by clustering the keywords of CT concepts and extracting indicators. The validity of indicators is verified by qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and expert evaluation. The results show that the evaluation indicators of CT constructed by spectral clustering technology are a more scientific, more comprehensive reflection of the ability dimensions of CT. It has unique advantages in constructing objective and comprehensive evaluation indicators and provides an evaluation basis for the evaluation practice of CT skills.},

A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students’ CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students took part in the experiment, of whom 28 assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. The results indicated that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in EL achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produced a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge; 3) their learning anxieties were also lower than those of the control group; and 4) the analysis of behavioral patterns also revealed that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrated better language-learning interaction, while the character-ER board game presented greater CT development in finding solutions.},

  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={6},
  pages={944-953},
  abstract={Contribution: This article proposes a new theoretical model with a goal to develop future human computational thinking (CT) in foundational computer science (CS) education. The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan.Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course.Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens.Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.},

  abstract={While there is growing recognition of the need to support young learners as they develop computational thinking (CT) skills, this paper advocates for an increased focus on computational identity (CI) and digital empowerment (DE) in particular, as we posit that these CT skills will help young learners become self-motivated, innovative creators. When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues: 1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their communities and helped them to establish their computational identities and digital empowerment.},

  abstract={Computational thinking, a problem solving method that uses computer science techniques, has recently become mainstream as many governments and major Internet companies are promoting programming skills among children. However, little is known about how programming affects other aspects of life beyond the acquired programming skills. In this regard, this paper summarizes the work done in the school San Diego and San Vicente (Madrid, Spain) during the third quarter of the year 2013/2014, where we conducted a study with four groups of students in 4th and 5th grade to measure to what extent the use of computer programming in English classes can be an interesting educational tool with a positive impact on the learning otucome of the students. The results show that the groups working with programming activities improved more than the groups using traditional resources. Moreover, when asked via surveys at the end of the study, most students felt that coding was a positive influence, not only for learning English, but for developing other important skills as teamwork and learning to learn.},

  abstract={Accelerated by the Do-It-Yourself mindset of the Web 2.0 culture, end-user programming-programming by end users with limited or even no formal programming background-is growing rapidly. Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end-users. More recent approaches include visual programming with a drag-and-drop style of programming that makes it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Conversational Programming, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to help end-users visualize discrepancies between the programs they intended to write and their actual programming results.},

This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined. All these steps would be possible with the help of MATLAB GUI immediately by pushing button.},

  abstract={Existing scheduling and decision solutions to container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) are falling short of peoples' wishes both in theory and in practice. This paper proposes a container terminal gang scheduling computational paradigm (GSCP) for planning and control at container terminals based on computational thinking. GSCP is built on the computing perspective and architecture of multi-processor system-on-chip. GSCP applies principles of pervasive computing to evaluate load conditions of core resources, and then integrates the fundamental principles of gang scheduling, processor affinity and load balancing to define the flexible and robust decision framework and scheduling algorithm set. Those are intended to improve the performance of CTLS, and strive for balance among through capacity for vessels and containers, task latency and load leveling as well. GSCP is demonstrated and validated by a typical container hub logistics service case with intensive computational experiments.},

To bridge this gap, this study validated the existing Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS) in Chinese context and use the scale to explore how students perceived coding. Also, the association between coding attitude and CT performance was investigated. A total of 217 elementary students were involved. Psychometric qualities of ESCAS (Chinese) were examined, and the effect of coding attitudes on CT cognitive performance was analyzed with linear regression. Results showed that ESCAS (Chinese) was a valid and reliable attitudinal scale, and coding interest could predict CT performance. Future directions for the study were discussed.},

  abstract={This paper presents the initial results of a research that aims to evaluate the contribution of the Scratch visual programming language in the development of computational thinking in comparison to the use of pseudocode. The comparison scenario was the teaching of programming logic for higher education students of the Physics course. The research was outlined with the methodology of action research, allowing the evaluation of the use of language at the end of the approach of each content delivered during the research. The presented results refer to the approach of two contents, of the four established for the conclusion of the research. The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate a progression in knowledge about programming logic. In this way, it was possible to verify that the use of the Scratch language contributed to the learning of programming logic.},

  abstract={In this paper we present an interactive learning environment (ILE) called CRA y JUEGA, focused on the development of computational thinking skills using block-based visual language programing with a 3D physics simulation system. It includes a programmable interaction system based on hand movement and gesture recognition, that allows to easily create and use customized hand gestures for interaction with 3D objects in a virtual environment. By applying the TAM model to discover the motivation, enjoyment and behavioral intention to use, the results show that: (1) using NUI technologies in interactive learning environments improve the enjoyment and the perceived ease of use; (2) perceived enjoyment was a significant issue in the intention to use; (3) NUIs interfaces during exercises could provide motivation to learn for middle school students.},

  abstract={STEAM-blended programming education is considered to be particularly effective for training computational thinking. In this paper, we aim to develop a web-based learning environment for STEAM-blended programming education. The proposed system can provide the learning materials of JavaScript that can easily carry out STEAM education at educational institutions. To effectively realize STEAM-blended programming education, visual programming is useful. Therefore, first, we will examine the learning effectiveness of visual programming. Next, we will develop a web-based programming learning support system based on "Mathematics" learning with JavaScript. After the above, the concept of STEAM-blended learning material using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is shown.},

  abstract={In this article, we examine a female-oriented, high school computing outreach program, FLAMES, consisting of an 8-week high school summer intern program run within a university computer science (CS) department. We focus on examining the effects of the program on students skills and affect towards computing. Much of the literature in CS outreach research examines summer camps, after-school programs, and other school-year events that often have a focus on only teaching students computing content. Our program is unique and socially relevant as students are trained to assist teachers with the development of Computational Thinking-Infused curricula for their classrooms. This paper presents the design of our program, an overview of the curriculum, and results including both student and teacher feedback. Results show that the program has benefited each of the parties involved, including its student participants, facilitators, and the teachers assisted by the participants. We share our lessons learned in order to help other CS departments develop similar broadening participation in computing programs.},

With using computers in close to all areas of our lives, the progress of algorithmic solutions to problems is very crucial. The comprehension of the character of problems and their algorithmic solutions is enormously most important for everyone. Algorithmic thinking is the capability to realize, execute, assessment, and create computational procedures for solving problems. This paper presents Alg-Design, a visual and block based programming environment to facilitate novices to improve the comprehension of Algorithmic thinking using programming and computing. The visual programming environment motivates students and they find enjoyable while creating personally meaningful projects.},

  abstract={Unlike enrollment in undergraduate computer science degree programs, there are no gender or ethnic imbalances in K-12 enrollment. While such disparities are seen at particular schools, such disparities do not exist in disciplinary courses such as history, math, or science where all students are required to take these courses. This paper discusses an approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the creation of their mobile app.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a block-based programming learning environment through animated pictogram content creation named “Pictoch”. Pictograms are constructed objects at a high level of abstraction. Abstraction, decomposition, and pattern recognition, which are all core concepts of computational thinking, are also essential ability for pictogram content creation. And if the structure of pictograms can be described as a procedural program, then it is based on algorithmic thinking. Pictoch especially focuses on human pictogram. This effect of the human pictogram can be familiar with “syntonic learning.” advocated by Papert. Pictoch has the instructions for posing and motion of human pictogram, and some more essential functions for making pictograms that drawing various objects and attaching safety signs. This paper introduces this application and describes its various basic functions and additional functions for class use.},

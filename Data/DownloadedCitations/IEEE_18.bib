  abstract={Enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as ASEE or IEEE. Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model.},

  abstract={The paradigm of education has undergone a significant transition from traditional teacher-directed instruction to student-centered problem-based learning. In various contexts, problem-based learning, computational thinking, and metaphor-based learning approaches have been used to deliver an efficacious learning of the concept. This paper puts forward a model and its usage to build metaphor based case studies directing towards cognitive thinking, self-directed learning and lifelong learning. The model directly influences on the problem solving thought process. The paper further presents a case study on application of this model and its effectiveness validated through the embedded design method. The method appears to be effective in from model analysis and feedback collected. This directly connects to the pattern recognition paradigm of the computational thinking process.},

  abstract={Aiming at the main problems of the traditional C++ course teaching, in this paper, a C++ teaching innovation model based on the concept of the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and the integration of the ACM competition and teaching is proposed based on the background of the era of the New Engineering. It takes the problem-solving and the live code as the main teaching line, takes the information technology teaching as the means, promotes the students’ integration of the theory and practice by the ACM/ICPC competition, and organically combines the process assessment and the final assessment, and implements the diversified assessment forms. For theoretical teaching, the authors put forward an innovative model of C++ teaching based on the concept of the OBE and the combination of the ACM competition and teaching. For practical teaching, the authors designed a keyword-oriented OJ system to address the problem of the large differences in the programming ability among the students. For the course assessment, the authors designed a C++ multi-topic intelligent online examination system. The results of more than ten years’ practical teaching show that the innovative model of the C++ teaching based on the OBE concept and the ACM competition has effectively cultivated the students’ computational thinking and significantly improved their programming ability and innovation ability. In the past ten years, our students won many ACM/ICPC prizes. At present, this teaching innovation model has been effectively promoted and applied in three campuses of our university. It has a certain leading and exemplary role in cultivating the top-notch innovative talents in the field of the computer science with the excellent professional programming ability, computational thinking, the national sentiment, the global vision and the all-round development.},

  abstract={Computer programming has become an increasingly cross-cutting theme and is no longer considered just a specialized subject. In some countries, the inclusion of this subject in the curricula of the basic cycles of their educational systems has been provided for, because it is recognized that programming promotes computational thinking which allows cognitive development of students. In Chile, the Universidad de La Frontera established that an initial programming course is given to all the Engineering degrees. Unfortunately, studies have shown that students are not achieving the competencies defined by the computational thinking approach. This research paper presents a flexible and systematic teaching framework for developing cognitive skills in programming courses. This framework considers the use of a systematic methodology of teaching programming, which focuses on the process of building solutions over the product; using electronic programmable devices; and sets of pre-defined exercises appropriate to various domains of the engineering area.},

  abstract={Nurturing programming talent early is crucial in today's digital world, especially in K-12 education, underscored by the rise of programming competitions for younger students. However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.},

  abstract={In Experience and Education, Dewey argued that humankind is “given to formulating its beliefs in terms of Either-Ors, between which it recognizes no intermediate possibilities.” Not surprisingly, educational computing is no exception. One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing.},

  abstract={This research addresses the integration of Machine Learning (ML) into K-12 education, which is increasingly recognized as essential for preparing students for the AI-driven world. However, the current landscape of ML implementation and its impact in K-12 classrooms remain areas of active investigation. In recent years, the integration of ML techniques into K-12 computing education has become increasingly prevalent, reflecting the growing importance of AI-driven and data-driven approaches across computing fields. This study addresses the gaps in understanding how intuition and agency develop in the context of ML systems within K-12 education, while also examining the emerging trajectories, challenges, and opportunities in teaching ML in K-12 education. Motivated by the need to assess the effectiveness and challenges of ML integration in K-12 settings, this survey-based study aims to provide insights into pedagogical approaches, tools utilized, and teachers' perceptions of ML in education. Drawing upon the importance of early ML exposure in developing computational thinking and fostering data literacy, this study seeks to address gaps such as age-appropriate content, teacher preparedness, and ethical considerations. By systematically reviewing existing research and surveying educators, this study aims to offer valuable insights into effective practices, identify tools available, and highlight areas for further research on the responsible implementation of ML in K-12 settings. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding gender-based differences in ML education. It briefly presents gender-based results obtained from surveys and data analysis, suggesting the need for tailored approaches to ML education that address potential gender-based barriers and biases. Additionally, the study discusses the paradigm shift required to successfully integrate ML into K-12 computing curricula, advocating for embracing ML as a fundamental component of future computing education. Ultimately, this study aims to inform computing educators and policymakers about the challenges and opportunities associated with ML education in K-12 settings, laying the groundwork for fostering ML literacy and computational thinking skills among K-12 students.},

  abstract={Using the Scratch environment as a tool to teach programming skills or develop computational thinking is increasingly common in all levels of education, well-documented case studies from primary school to university can be found. However, there are reports that indicate that students learning to program in this environment show certain habits that are contrary to the basic programming recommendations. In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects. The results obtained show that, in general, projects in the repository also incur in the investigated malpractices. Along with suggestions for future work, some ideas that might assist to address such situations are proposed in the conclusions of the paper.},

This teaching mode first design a programming learning situation which is familiar by students because of its close connection to the students' daily life with Scratch for student through the analysis of the common elements between the situation and the concept of programming. The n guide students learning in the situation, and transfer back to the traditional programming environmental after he understand the content of concept.

  abstract={Nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. The project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of STEM Education with using IoT and Artificial Intelligence.},

  abstract={Introduction to Computing is a public course for the first-year non-major undergraduate students, aiming at training students for the abilities in computer science and technology with computational thinking. However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.},

In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. For this reason, educational robotics can be easily implemented thanks to the card connectors. The motors and servos can be managed by Crumble. Different sensors such as the ultrasonic distance sensor, infrared distance sensor and line sensor can also be connected. In addition, Crumble can handle up to 32 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs (Light Emitter Diodes) independently and with 24-bit color resolution. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This document presents a workshop that focuses on two main objectives. The first is to make an event to promote Crumble locally. On the other hand, the aim of this event is to present a robotic teaching tool so that people can take their first steps in the world of robotics. This workshop is aimed at those children and adults who want to discover the possibilities that Crumble brings in the introduction to robotics. An introduction to Crumble in the context of educational robotics is developed throughout this workshop.},

  abstract={In this work in progress paper we present an example of innovative practice in organizing informal STEM education workshops with young children. The workshops were divided into two learning scenarios, unplugged programming and hands-on robot play. Unplugged programming encourages understanding of the core concepts of programming such as algorithms and computational thinking rather than focusing on the programming language. In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops. Combining unplugged activities with robots helps bridging the gap between imagination and reality, therefore improving learning.},

  abstract={We present a block-based language for specifying feedback to novice learners about the programs they are constructing in a block-based programming language. In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.},

Social Digital Literacy (SDL) is the way in which people use social media to enhance their social network, effectively increase their knowledge base, while communicating clearly and professionally through the use of social media. The increased popularity of social media amongst college students makes it an opportune time to consider a new form of literacy based on how technology is used by students, the devices that students interact with on a daily bases and the mainstream acceptance of social media in daily life. In order to retain students in computing classes, students are taught in an efficacious manner how to capitalize on the technology that they use on a daily basis. By increasing their SDL proficiency to become a more informed student, a well versed employee and consciously aware of what they post to social media. The expectation is that the approach being used can be implemented in any introductory programming course.},

The goal of the program is to advance both knowledge and practice in creating inclusive, responsive computer science/computational thinking programs for all K-12 youth. RPPs represent an approach to research that, by design, is both more equitable and more ethical because it leverages community stakeholder experiences and perspectives to inform research questions, methods, and meaning-making. RPPs are thus potentially powerful tools for equity-oriented initiatives such as CS for All. Beginning in December 2016, the Research + Practice Collaboratory, an NSF-funded initiative based at the University of Washington, has led ten RPP development workshops for CS for All, collectively serving over 700 members of the community. At these workshops we have collected data about how the community sees itself benefiting from the adoption of RPP approaches to the work. In this experience paper we describe what we have learned about the field's interests with respect to adopting RPP approaches to the work.},

  title={Modeling: A computer science concept for general education}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={For all computer scientists the term `modeling' is well known. It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project “Informatics - A Child's Play”, which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons.},

  abstract={Research has identified multiple reasons why people do end-user programming but has yet to quantify one of the most basic: making more money. This is an important gap in the literature given the current widespread efforts to promote computational thinking skills, because this education campaign is often linked to the argument that end-user programming skills will contribute to workers' long-term career prospects. Therefore, this paper presents a study investigating how the earnings of workers varied as a function of whether they used spreadsheets/databases and/or did programming at work. Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither. These results provoke numerous questions for future research regarding what financial benefits workers can expect to obtain in different settings through end-user programming.},

There are several reasons for this, but opinions point to the student's inability to solve problems, difficulties in logical reasoning and lack of critical attitude. The Portuguese Ministry of Education proposed in 2015/2016, in extracurricular period, the Getting Started with Programming challenging in primary School activities, with the intention of promoting computational thinking competences in students. Two schools from Coimbra city opted to use Scratch software for the implementation of this project aiming to promote school success in subjects already mentioned. The project, based on the academic curriculum of 4th grade, intends to link the theoretical knowledge with the practical knowledge, promoting the characteristic values of the city of Coimbra. This project implementation resulted in different applications (computer games) created by students, covering the contents of the mentioned subjects, but concretizing these knowledge with the socio-cultural and environmental realities of the city of Coimbra. The following study demonstrates the results obtained in 5 classes in 2015-2016 and six classes in 2016-2017, according to student satisfaction and project evaluation.},

Considerable efforts worldwide suggest the need for more empirical studies providing evidence-based practices to introduce and engage children with coding activities. The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8-17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations. Hence, we improve our knowledge about children's competences in coding.},

  abstract={Educational robotics is a practice that has been disseminated in Brazil and in the world, allowing the inclusion of technology in the school environment through stimulating pedagogical activities for students, making them practice teamwork, fine motor coordination, and computational thinking, among other benefits. For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community.},

  abstract={This paper purports to share with the higher education community the global PBL active learning curriculum and the learning environment, which have been collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University (KU). The collaborated universities developed an optimal curriculum to enhance and nurture students' "Future Work Skills 2020" defined by the Institute for the Future, such future human skills as Sense Making, Social Intelligence, Novel & Adaptive Thinking, Cross-Cultural Competencies, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, Transdisciplinarity, Design Mindset, Cognitive Load Management, and Virtual Collaboration. The curriculum fully employs PBL strategies in global teams, where teams for PBL are organized with students with heterogeneous cultural backgrounds in the virtual learning environment. The basic concept of such curriculum is based on COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning), originally developed by State University of New York. COIL makes full usage of IT to generate virtual learning environment for students worldwide. In order to go beyond the COIL concept incorporating the future skills defined by IFTF, the allied universities employed PBL in global AGILE teams to deepen insights from various cultural viewpoints in terms of consensus building through team discussions. Due to the spatial and temporal differences, enrolled students conducted their team learning activities in the virtual learning environment asynchronously, making use of IT technologies and cloud services in order to be on "the same page" in the progress of the project throughout the course. Further, the assessment strategies to enhance students' efficacy is the key factor in the course, which is also discussed with examples. This paper reports the global PBL active learning curriculum and environment collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University.},

In EarSketch, students write computer code to remix sound samples into original music compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application. Coupled with sound samples rooted in modern music genres, EarSketch generates deep student engagement. We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.},

  abstract={As a summer camp for middle school and high school students, a new method of learning/teaching computer science was explored: Teaching high schoolers MIT's App Inventor for 2 weeks and then during the following two weeks, having the high schoolers teach middle schoolers ranging from upcoming 6th to 9th graders. The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials. The level of comprehension amongst the middle schoolers was evident through their ability to produce the final products, which ultimately varied depending upon the method of teaching that the high schooler chose to teach with. This paper presents the organization of the summer programming camp, contents and learning outcome.},

  abstract={Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The H1N1 pandemic of 2009 and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa serve as a reminder of the social, economic and health burden of infectious diseases. The ongoing trends towards urbanization, global travel, climate change and a generally older and immuno-compromised population continue to make epidemic planning and control challenging. Recent quantitative changes in high performance pervasive computing have created new opportunities for collecting, integrating, analyzing and accessing information related to large urban social systems, disease surveillance and global logistics and supply chains. The advances in network and information science that build on this new capability provide entirely new ways for reasoning and controlling epidemics. In this talk I will overview of the state of the art in computational networked epidemiology with an emphasis on computational thinking and on the development of high performance computing oriented decision-support environments for planning and response in the event of epidemics. I will describe how such systems can be used to support near real-time planning and response during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu and the recent Ebola Outbreak in West Africa. Computational challenges and directions for future research will be discussed.},

  abstract={Computational thinking in recent years has been universally defined as the ”new English”, or basic knowledge necessary for everyone. As English, is important to include it as early as possible in teaching programs, right from preschool. This need is so felt as to make it, for example, compulsory in kindergarten in Italy since 2022. Obviously, this implies the use of simple tools that do not provide reading and writing skills. This work proposes a learning program which could be carried out precisely during the three years of kindergarten, from 3 to 6 years of age, and prepares children for coding, a teaching subject that has already been proposed in Italy for primary school since a few years.},

  abstract={The demand for cybersecurity professionals is projected to grow substantially, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that employment in cybersecurity within the US will grow by 18% from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York. The paper discusses the background, details of the earlier CSP course, how relevant cybersecurity content was identified, and then integrated into the CSP course to create the CyberCSP variant of the Computer Science Principles course.},

  abstract={As reproducible research tools and skills become increasingly in-demand across disciplines, so too does the need for innovative and collaborative training. While some academic departments incorporate software like R or Python in coursework and research, many students remain reliant on self-teaching in order to gain the necessary skills to work with their data. However, given the growing number of students interested in computational tools and resources for research automation, relying on student self-teaching and learning is not an efficient method for training the next generation of scholars. To address the educational need for computational thinking and learning across various academic departments on campus, the UC San Diego Library has been running Software Carpentry workshops (two day bootcamps to introduce foundational programming concepts and best practices) since 2015. The Library, as a discipline-agnostic entity with a history of serving as a trusted resource for information, has been well positioned to provide training for this new era of research methodology. The core of our success is the collaboration with the growing community of Software and Data Carpentry instructors at UC San Diego with expertise in various research disciplines. Building on this strong partnership and leveraging the Library's resources and expertise in digital literacy, the campus can better support data-driven and technologically-focused education and research.},

  abstract={The Creative Computing Challenge (CCC) project (2014-2018) is funded by the National Science Foundation and is designed to broaden participation in computing by providing professional development (PD) for high school teachers at Career & Technical Education (CTE) programs throughout the state of New Hampshire. Teachers receive a stipend and tablets for their classrooms; they attend several in-person PD sessions through the year, where master teachers and PD facilitators introduce modeling of inquiry and equity-based practices, as well as teach the App Inventor tool and how to inculcate computational thinking in students. Project evaluation has included teacher interviews, classroom and PD observations, as well as student and teacher surveys. External evaluation of this project has been an integral part of the project from the beginning and, along with the project team’s observations and input, has significantly reshaped the project activities. It became clear after the first year that a central challenge of this project would be working with a mix of teachers across multiple domains – from teachers who had little experience even using computers to teachers who had computer science degrees; from teachers who came to teaching from professional backgrounds to those who had education degrees; and from beginning teachers to those who had been teaching the same courses for twenty years. Through evaluation data and really listening to teacher feedback, we not only tailored the PD content and structure, but also refined the data collection instruments and evaluation design to bridge the gap between different teacher experiences and levels of preparation. As a result, we have been able to bring computing into non-technical content areas such as Hospitality and non-programming classes such as Photography, as well as support computing educations in New Hampshire CTE programs. In Year 4, we now better understand the range of benefits and challenges involved in working with CTE programs and inserting CCC-inspired curricular modules in non-computing courses.},
